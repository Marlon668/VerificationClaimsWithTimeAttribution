pomt-08639	"Taxes went down under Jerry Brown."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/17/jerry-brown/jerry-brown-raised-taxes-not-overall/	The California governor's race between Republican Meg Whitman and Democrat Jerry Brown has turned into a political retrospective of the '70s, '80s and '90s, with a special guest appearance from Bill Clinton. Our story begins with an ad from the Whitman campaign and goes on to check a claim in a campaign ad by Brown. "Jerry Brown's good old days -- but what really happened?" asks a narrator in the Whitman ad. Cut to Clinton himself in his 1992 prime. "CNN -- not me, CNN -- says his assertion about his tax record was quote, just plain wrong. Jerry Brown went out there and took credit for the fact that the people of California voted for Proposition 13, which lowered taxes, which he opposed. And now he's going around and taking credit for it. He raised taxes as governor of California. He had a surplus when he took office and a deficit when he left. He doesn't tell the people the truth." Clinton's words were from the 1992 Democratic primary for president, when Brown and Clinton ran against each other and regularly traded barbs. Today, of course, Clinton is the former president considered to be one of the best at getting the Democratic base to turn out in elections. Brown responded to the new ad with the old footage at a meeting with his supporters on a Sunday just days after the ad ran. Either the ad touched a nerve or maybe Brown didn't know there was a camera in the room, but he lashed out -- not at the Whitman campaign, but at Clinton himself. "I mean, Clinton's a nice guy, but who ever said he always told the truth?" Brown said on Sept. 12, 2010. "You remember, right? There's that whole story there about 'did he or didn't he.' ... I did not have taxes with this state, so let's be clear about that." That's a not-so-subtle reference to Clinton's impeachment. It's not clear that Brown knew he was being taped that Sunday. He apologized to Clinton on Monday, and Clinton endorsed Brown on Tuesday. In a statement, Clinton said the ad is misleading because the CNN report he cited was "erroneous." "Moreover the tough campaign we fought 18 years ago is not relevant to the choice facing Californians today. Jerry and I put that behind us a long time ago," Clinton wrote. Brown defended his record on taxes again in his own ad. His ad says, "Wouldn't it be nice if every time Meg Whitman told a lie her nose would grow? Newspapers report that claims in this Meg Whitman ad are false, and she knows it. Taxes went down under Jerry Brown. But Whitman's nose keeps growing by the millions." Here, we're checking Brown's statement that, "Taxes went down under Jerry Brown." We started by going back to Clinton's statements in the Whitman ad and then looking at the former governor's record. The metric that the CNN report used was a calculation put together by the California Department of Finance showing the tax burden per $100 of income. In 2010, for example, the tax burden was estimated at $6.48 per $100 of personal income. (See the historical chart here.) Back in 1992, CNN's fact-check looked at the wrong years and reported that taxes went up. The most recent data shows that the tax burden went down. Factcheck.org's Brooks Jackson -- who worked for CNN back then -- explained the issue with the data in a post at the Factcheck.org website. The budgets Jerry Brown oversaw were for fiscal years 1975 to 1982. The tax burden during that time started at $6.95, increased to a high of $7.74 in 1977, then declined to $6.56 in 1982. There were no major laws passed increasing taxes during that time, so what made the collections rise and fall? We had a hard time finding consensus on this 20-year-old question. Property values were rising, which led to Proposition 13 in 1978, which lowered property taxes and made it harder to increase other taxes. But there's a dispute over whether Proposition 13 affected state tax revenues that much; some say that it curtailed local taxes, not state taxes. The reason for the state tax decline, according to this view, is that a poor economy depressed tax revenues. We also wanted to check and see if Brown had signed any major new tax changes into law while he was governor. We looked through old news stories and found that Brown approved a two-cent per gallon gasoline tax for highways toward the end of his term. But he also approved a measure to index income tax brackets for inflation, a move that had the effect of reducing taxes for some. We also found news coverage of various business-related taxes; Brown signed measures that both increased and decreased taxes for some businesses. In fact, Brown oversaw large state surpluses in his early years as governor, which happened without any new tax increases. Some people blame Brown for sitting on the surpluses, which allowed the tax revolt movement for Proposition 13 to gain steam. Brown opposed Proposition 13 before it passed, but after it did, he became an ardent defender. Los Angeles Times columnist George Skelton wrote about Brown's reversal in a column recently, reminding Californians that Brown called himself a "born-again tax-cutter" after the vote, and won the endorsement of Howard Jarvis, the proposition's chief backer. In this year's race, Brown says there should be no tax increases without a vote. We found that when Brown was governor, he signed an increase to gas taxes, a decrease to income taxes through indexing, and various increases and decreases for business. He had significant surpluses for the first part of his governorship and in all likelihood didn't need to raise taxes. The most significant evidence in favor of Brown's statement are the state numbers that show taxes per $100 of resident income. By that metric, taxes went up, and then down under Brown, and finished a little lower than when he started. Those numbers sway the meter in a positive direction. We rate the statement "Taxes went down under Jerry Brown," as Mostly True.	None	Jerry Brown	None	None	None	2010-09-17T09:58:59	2010-09-14	['None']
pomt-10128	"(Bill) Ayers and Obama ran a radical education foundation together."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/10/john-mccain/not-a-radical-group-and-ayers-didnt-run-it/	For most of the election, Sen. John McCain's campaign has been somewhat subtle about trying to tie Sen. Barack Obama to the former '60s radical William Ayers. No longer. A 90-second Web ad released Oct. 8, 2008, features sinister music, side-by-side photographs of Obama and Ayers, and a series of dubious allegations about their past connections, including this one: "Ayers and Obama ran a radical education foundation together." Ayers was a founding member of the militant Vietnam-era anti-war group the Weathermen. He was investigated for his role in a series of domestic bombings, but the charges were dropped in 1974 due to prosecutorial misconduct. He is now an education professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and actively engaged in the city's civic life. The McCain campaign said the "radical education foundation" to which they were referring is the Chicago Annenberg Challenge, a charity endowed by publishing magnate Walter Annenberg that funded public-school programs in Chicago from 1995 to 2001. We'll look at whether the foundation was radical. But first we have to grapple with whether Obama and Ayers ran it. Obama served on the foundation's volunteer board from its inception in 1995 through its dissolution in 2001, and was chair for the first four years. So an argument can be made that he ran it, though an executive director handled day-to-day operations. Ayers, who received his doctorate in education from Columbia University in 1987 and is now a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, was active in getting the foundation up and running. He and two other activists led the effort to secure the grant from Annenberg, and he worked without pay in the early months of 1995, prior to the board's hiring of an executive director, to help the foundation get incorporated and formulate its bylaws, said Ken Rolling, who was the foundation's only executive director. Ayers went on to become a member of the "collaborative," an advisory group that advised the board of directors and the staff. However, Ayers "was never on the board of the Chicago Annenberg Challenge," and he "never made a decision programmatically or had a vote," Rolling said. "He (Ayers) was at board meetings — which, by the way, were open — as a guest," Rolling said. "That is not anything near Bill Ayers and Barack Obama running the Chicago Annenberg Challenge." Now, was the foundation radical? The McCain campaign cited several pieces of evidence for that allegation, including a 1995 invitation from the foundation for applications from schools "that want to make radical changes in the way teachers teach and students learn." The campaign appears to have confused two different definitions of the word "radical." Clearly the invitation referred to "a considerable departure from the usual or traditional," rather than "advocating extreme measures to retain or restore a political state of affairs." The campaign also cited two projects the foundation funded, one having to do with a United Nations-themed Peace School and another that focused on African-American studies. "That is radical in the eye of this campaign and we imagine in the eyes of most Americans," said Michael Goldfarb, a spokesman for McCain. "It is a subjective thing, and there are going to be people in Berkeley and Chicago who think that is totally legitimate." Teaching about the United Nations and African-American studies may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's hardly "radical" in the same way Ayers' Vietnam-era activities were. Moreover, most of the projects the foundation funded (more on that below) were not remotely controversial. The McCain campaign also cited an opinion piece by conservative commentator Stanley Kurtz in the Sept. 23, 2008, Wall Street Journal as evidence of the foundation's radicalism. Kurtz wrote that Ayers was the "guiding spirit" of the foundation, and it "translated Mr. Ayers's radicalism into practice." But Ayers' views on education, though certainly reform-oriented and left-of-center, are not considered anywhere near as radical as his Vietnam-era views on war. And even if they were, there was a long list of individuals involved with the Chicago Annenberg Challenge whose positions provided them far more authority over its direction than Ayers' advisory role gave him. Let's look at a few, starting with the funder. Annenberg was a lifelong Republican and former ambassador to the United Kingdom under President Richard Nixon. His widow, Leonore, has endorsed McCain. Kurtz might just as plausibly have accused Obama and the foundation of "translating Annenberg's conservatism into practice." Among the other board members who served with Obama were: Stanley Ikenberry, former president of the University of Illinois; Arnold Weber, former president of Northwestern University and assistant secretary of labor in the Nixon administration; Scott Smith, then publisher of the Chicago Tribune; venture capitalist Edward Bottum; John McCarter, president of the Field Museum; Patricia Albjerg Graham, former dean of the Harvard University Graduate School of Education, and a host of other mainstream folks. "The whole idea of it being radical when it was this tie of blue-chip, white-collar, CEOs and civic leaders is just ridiculous," said the foundation's former development director, Marianne Philbin. The foundation gave money to groups of public schools – usually three to 10 – who partnered with some sort of outside organization to improve their students' achievement. In his opinion piece, Kurtz puts a sinister spin on this: "Instead of funding schools directly, it required schools to affiliate with 'external partners,' which actually got the money...CAC disbursed money through various far-left community organizers, such as the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (or ACORN)." Rollings said the foundation tried to fund the schools directly, but doing so proved to be a "bureaucratic nightmare." But any external group that received money had to have created a program in partnership with a network of public schools. And though ACORN is considered a liberal organization, the vast majority of the foundation's external partners were not remotely controversial. Here are a few examples: the Chicago Symphony, the University of Chicago, Loyola University, Northwestern University, the Chicago Children's Museum, the Museum of Science and Industry, the Field Museum, the Commercial Club of Chicago, the Garfield Park Conservatory Alliance and the Logan Square Neighborhood Association. Had Kurtz chosen to accuse Obama of carrying water for the conservative Annenberg, he might have written: "CAC disbursed money to various business-friendly entities, such as the Museum of Science and Industry and the Commercial Club of Chicago." See how easy it is? The programs the foundation funded were designed to allow individuals from the "external partners" – whether the musicians in the symphony or the business leaders in the commercial club – to help improve student achievement. They were along the lines of mentoring by artists, literacy instruction, professional development for teachers and administrators, and training for parents in everything from computer skills to helping their children with homework to advocating for their children at school. This last activity – something suburban parents practice with zeal – is also suspect in Kurtz's view: "CAC records show that board member Arnold Weber was concerned that parents 'organized' by community groups might be viewed by school principals 'as a political threat.'" That is typical of Kurtz's essay – relatively innocuous facts cast in the worst possible light. That's appropriate for an opinion piece, perhaps, but hardly grounds for a purportedly factual political ad accusing the group of radicalism. We could go on and on with evidence that the Chicago Annenberg Challenge was a rather vanilla charitable group. For example, under the deal with Annenberg every dollar from him had to be matched by two from elsewhere. The co-funders were a host of respected, mainstream institutions, such as the National Science Foundation, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and the Chicago Public Schools. In short, this was a mainstream foundation funded by a mainstream, Republican business leader and led by an overwhelmingly mainstream, civic-minded group of individuals. Ayers' involvement in its inception and on an advisory committee do not make it radical – nor does the funding of programs involving the United Nations and African-American studies. This attack is false, but it's more than that – it's malicious. It unfairly tars not just Obama, but all the other prominent, well-respected Chicagoans who also volunteered their time to the foundation. They came from all walks of life and all political backgrounds, and there's ample evidence their mission was nothing more than improving ailing public schools in Chicago. Yet in the heat of a political campaign they have been accused of financing radicalism. That's Pants on Fire wrong.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-10-10T00:00:00	2008-10-09	['None']
pomt-04056	Says "Abortion clinics in Oregon, as in most states, have no state oversight and are not held to basic health or safety standards."	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2013/jan/26/gayle-atteberry/are-abortion-clinics-oregon-not-held-basic-health-/	Gayle Atteberry, the executive director of anti-abortion group Oregon Right to Life, wrote a recent post on the organization’s website titled "About those safe abortions." She goes on to write about how abortions are "anything but safe." Part of the problem here, she writes, is that "abortion clinics in Oregon, as in most states, have no state oversight and are not held to basic health or safety standards." Even tattoo parlors and veterinary clinics follow state-imposed health standards, she wrote. We wondered whether that was true. Do abortion clinics in Oregon really face no state oversight? Is it true that they don’t have to meet basic health and safety standards? In an interview, Atteberry said that "ambulatory surgical" clinics, such as ones for eye or shoulder surgery, are subject to state oversight, but that "abortion clinics are exempted specifically from abiding by these restrictions and safety guidelines." She directed us to three Oregon administrative rules.The first rule includes a definition of a state-licensed "ambulatory surgical center," which includes many outpatient surgery clinics, and goes on to list safety regulations the clinics must meet. Sure enough, there’s an exemption for abortion clinics. The other rules spell out safety provisions for tattoo parlors and veterinary facilities. Next, we researched abortions in Oregon. In 2011, 9,566 abortions were performed in the state, according to the Oregon Health Authority. Of those, about 6 percent were performed in hospitals and doctors’ offices. The rest were performed in ambulatory surgical centers and at free-standing clinics. At least one abortion clinic, Lovejoy Surgicenter in Northwest Portland, is a state-licensed ambulatory surgical center. The Oregon Health Authority’s Health Care Regulation and Quality Improvement program regulates abortion clinics that fall under this category. Lovejoy is subject to unannounced site visits every year and a half to three or four years, said administrator Kayla Reich. "They’ll pull patient charts, look at medications, make sure there’s nothing out of date," she said. "We’ll have surveyors here for two or three days going through everything." Lovejoy performed about 2,400 abortions last year and about 2,500 in 2011, just more than a quarter of the abortions performed in the state in 2011. Also, some abortion clinics are satellite hospital clinics that operate under hospital licenses, said Alissa Robbins, a spokeswoman with the Oregon Health Authority. So we’ve learned that some locations that provide abortions are regulated and some aren’t. Most free-standing abortion clinics, however, face multiple layers of state and federal oversight because they accept Medicaid patients and seek reimbursements. For example, Planned Parenthood Columbia Willamette’s eight clinics in Oregon, which are categorized as free-standing clinics, are subject to inspections, audits and other health and safety oversight. The three co-medical directors who oversee medical care at the clinics are all licensed doctors on the obstetrics and gynecology faculty of OHSU, spokeswoman Liz Delapoer said. There is a chance an abortion clinic could refuse to see Medicaid patients, meaning those clinics wouldn’t be subject to some of the layers of oversight Planned Parenthood experiences, but many do. We also looked at who performs abortions. Those people -- doctors and some physician assistants and nurse practitioners -- are licensed and overseen by the state. Kathleen Haley, executive director of the Oregon Medical Board, which licenses doctors, said the agency has not received any complaints about abortion providers or unsafe abortions in the 18 years she has worked there. Atteberry, in a follow-up interview, said that having state-licensed doctors does not guarantee they meet health standards. "The state does not come into where they’re doing an abortion, making sure they’re doing it under health and safety standards, or in a building that (meets) health and safety standards." We understand the larger political context here: Opponents of abortion in Oregon and nationally have tried to seek more regulation for abortion clinics, but supporters of abortion rights say these types of structural regulations have no bearing on the safety of the procedures. PolitiFact Oregon will stay clear of that debate. We’re looking into the factual basis of Atteberry’s statement that abortion clinics in Oregon have no state oversight and are not held to basic health or safety standards. There is an element of truth to this statement. Some abortion clinics are not licensed in the way other outpatient medical offices are regulated. But we found at least one abortion clinic, Lovejoy, which does roughly 25 percent of Oregon abortions, that is regulated as a state-licensed ambulatory surgical center. Atteberry acknowledged Lovejoy’s regulation in our initial interview. Some other clinics operate under a hospital license. All of those are subject to health and safety regulations. Plus, the people who perform the abortions are licensed medical personnel subject to state oversight. While some abortion clinics are not subject to the state oversight that veterinary clinics or tattoo parlors receive, that doesn’t mean they and the people who work in them are not held to basic health standards. Those are critical facts that would give readers a different impression. We rate this statement Mostly False.	None	Gayle Atteberry	None	None	None	2013-01-26T03:00:00	2012-12-26	['Oregon']
pomt-06093	Says he lived up to a 2008 promise when he "closed corporate tax loopholes that were sending profits overseas."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/05/barack-obama/barack-obama-reelection-video-says-he-closed-corpo/	With all eyes on Iowa for the Republican caucuses, President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign reminded watchers of his own Iowa win — and what he has done to keep his campaign promises. Obama for America bought banner ads across the home page of the online Des Moines Register on Jan. 3, 2012, with a link to Obama's 2008 victory speech in the state. Music plays as candidate Obama promises action on health care, taxes, energy independence and the war in Iraq. Between clips, white text across the screen highlights Obama's policy accomplishments. For example, candidate Obama declares, "I’ll be a president who ends the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas." At that point, an on-screen visual reads: "Closed corporate tax loopholes that were sending profits overseas." We wondered whether the ad’s claim about Obama’s accomplishment is justified. We asked the Obama campaign for supporting material, and they said they were referring to Public Law 111-226, a measure that was primarily aimed at providing economic aid to states. To offset the cost of new spending, however, the bill included a few provisions related to taxation of international corporations -- what a number of tax experts have told us can be fairly described as loopholes. As we explained in a previous item, Obama signed the bill into law on Aug. 10, 2010. The tax provisions took away more than a half dozen existing exemptions and credits estimated to be worth $9.8 billion over the subsequent 10 years. Here’s how it worked. The United States, unlike a variety of other countries, taxes its companies on the foreign profits they earn. But the companies don't have to pay taxes on their foreign earnings until they bring those profits back to the U.S. So companies tend to keep the money with their foreign subsidiaries as long as they can. But companies also get U.S. tax credits for taxes they pay to foreign governments, and some companies figured out how to game the system by keeping their profits overseas while still claiming a tax credit for taxes paid on the same income to foreign governments. That's what the law tried to address. It said that companies can't claim the foreign tax credit until they report their income. But while there is some truth to the claim that the president signed legislation that "closed corporate tax loopholes thta were sending profits overseas," we should point out a few issues. First, under the old law, companies weren’t necessarily "sending profits overseas," as the ad states, but may have been keeping in place profits that were already being generated overseas. Still, this strikes us as a fairly minor linguistic quibble. A more pertinent question is whether the legislation Obama signed fulfills the pledge he made in Iowa in 2008 -- that he’ll "be a president who ends the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas." H. David Rosenbloom, director of the International Tax Program at the New York University School of Law, calls the legislation "very narrow." "It addresses a specific tax planning strategy whereby foreign taxes and credits are ‘split’ from the foreign income that gave rise to them," he said. Left relatively unscathed is the broader "deferral regime" that allows companies to avoid U.S. taxes on foreign income as long as they do not "repatriate" -- bring home -- the money and avoid a few other hurdles. For instance, one proposal by former Walt Disney Co. executive Preston Padden, now an adjunct law professor at the University of Colorado, urges a reduction in the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent, which would be aligned with most foreign countries, paired with stricter "anti-deferral" rules. "A tax rate comparable to foreign countries would greatly eliminate the incentives to move operations and jobs offshore because of rate differentials, and the anti-deferral regime would minimize the benefits to U.S. companies from offshoring operations and jobs," Padden wrote in a recent op-ed. The narrower law signed by Obama, by contrast, "will hardly prevent companies from sending profits abroad, keeping them abroad, and otherwise profiting from the current set of international tax rules," Rosenbloom said. Even after passage of the 2010 law, "most experts would agree that the U.S. international tax system encourages U.S. multinationals to accumulate profits offshore," said Lawrence Lokken, an emeritus professor of law at the University of Florida. Our ruling While there is some truth to the claim that Obama signed legislation that "closed corporate tax loopholes that were sending profits overseas," experts say the law by itself doesn’t live up to Obama’s promise in Iowa to "be a president who ends the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas." Incentives deeply embedded in the tax code still exist. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-01-05T18:04:26	2012-01-03	['None']
pomt-04006	Says the pension and health benefits reform "eliminated collective bargaining for health benefits."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/feb/07/barbara-buono/barbara-buono-claims-state-reform-eliminated-colle/	Just as Gov. Chris Christie celebrates how he approved pension and health benefits reform in June 2011, state Sen. Barbara Buono says she stood up for her beliefs by opposing the landmark bill. As the senator emerged last week as the most likely Democrat to take on the Republican governor in his re-election bid this year, Buono claimed in TV interviews that she rejected the legislation because it eliminated collective bargaining for public employees’ health benefits. Buono, who was Senate Majority Leader when the reform passed, broke with Senate President Stephen Sweeney when she voted against the legislation. That vote likely contributed to her ultimately losing the leadership post. In a Jan. 28 interview on NJToday, Buono (D-Middlesex) said she "drew a line in the sand when it came to eliminating collective bargaining for employee health benefits." The senator repeated that claim in an interview the following day on Fox 5’s Good Day New York. "I’ll continue to stand up for what I believe in, even if it’s not politically expedient -- and that is, I opposed this last piece of legislation that also eliminated collective bargaining for health benefits," Buono said. The 2011 reform mandates increases in health care contributions without employees’ approval through negotiations, but the senator’s wrong to suggest that bargaining right is eliminated forever. Once the increases are fully implemented after a four-year period, unions can resume negotiating those contribution levels. Let’s review the legislation. Signed into law by Christie on June 28, 2011, the reform requires employees to contribute higher payments toward their pension and health care benefits. Phased in over four years, the health care contributions are based on a percentage of one’s premium and vary according to salaries and levels of coverage. The new contribution levels took effect immediately for employees whose union contracts had expired. For workers under an existing contract when the law went into effect, the payment levels and four-year time frame begin when their contract expires. Those increases are non-negotiable, but after the fourth year of implementation, the health care contributions can become part of union negotiations. Here’s what the law says: "After full implementation, those contribution levels shall become part of the parties’ collective negotiations and shall then be subject to collective negotiations in a manner similar to other negotiable items between the parties." But David Turner, communications director for the Buono campaign, argued in an e-mail that the legislation took away workers’ bargaining right to negotiate health benefits when it imposed higher costs without their consent. "Sen. Buono strongly believes in the right of workers to collectively bargain for their health benefits," Turner said. "Governor Christie's legislation explicitly takes away this right by unilaterally imposing higher costs without workers' consent. "This is by definition eliminating employees right to negotiate their healthcare. Collective bargaining was vital in building the middle class in New Jersey and America and Sen. Buono will continue to support this fundamental right." Our ruling In a TV interview, Buono claimed that the pension and health benefits reform "eliminated collective bargaining for health benefits." The reform does mandate higher health care contributions over a four-year period without the employees’ approval through negotiations, but the senator is wrong to suggest that bargaining right is eliminated indefinitely. After the payment increases have been fully implemented, those contribution levels return to the bargaining table as a part of union negotiations. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-10820	Obama "won health care for 150,000 people."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/20/barack-obama/making-more-families-eligible-expanded-coverage/	In a campaign ad, an announcer says Obama "won health care for 150,000 people." The statement is based on a 2003 law Obama sponsored when he was an Illinois state senator. His bill expanded income eligibility for KidsCare and FamilyCare, the state health insurance programs low-income families. Both programs saw sizable increases in enrollment after the law was passed. The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation looked at the Illinois program and found that the children's enrollment increased by 55,421 between 2003 and 2005, the year Illinois abolished an income requirement. Adult enrollment increased by 100,458 between 2003 and 2006. That comes to a total of 155,879. Of course, it bears noting that expansion of health insurance was a big goal of the Democratic governor who signed the bill, and Obama's legislation had a co-sponsor, a Republican, in the Illinois House. But the simplicity of his claim is hard to dispute, and being able to work with others to achieve goals is a theme of the ad in which he makes the claim. It all ads up to true.

pomt-09789	"Mathematically, the White Sox can still get in the playoffs."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/20/barack-obama/obama-says-white-sox-can-still-make-playoffs/	At the conclusion of a wide-ranging interview on NBC's Meet the Press , President Barack Obama said he was holding out hope that his beloved Chicago White Sox can still make the playoffs. Host David Gregory asked him, "On a lighter note, before I let you go, Mr. President, you were brazen this summer at the All-Star Game wearing your Chicago White Sox jacket out there to throw out the first pitch. Hate to break it to you, but doesn't look so good for your White Sox here. So I want to know who is your pick to win the World Series?" Obama replied, "You know — I am — I think mathematically, the White Sox can still get in the playoffs." Here at PolitiFact, we're focused more on the American League East (Go Rays!), so we had lost track of how the White Sox were doing in the AL Central. We turned to our favorite baseball writer, Marc Topkin of the St. Petersburg Times , to find out if Obama was right. Topkin told us that while the White Sox are out of the running to be the wild-card team for the American League, it's mathematically possible they could still win their division and then be in the playoffs. As of Sunday morning when Meet the Press aired, the White Sox were 5 1/2 games behind the first-place Detroit Tigers. Topkin told us the White Sox "wouldn't be mathematically eliminated until there were 6 games left, and going into today they have 13 left." So Obama can hold out hope for at least another week or so. The odds are against the Sox — they play the Tigers and the Minnesota Twins, the No. 2 team in the division, in the next week. And Topkin noted that a lot of things have to break in favor of the Sox. But Obama is right that it's at least mathematically possible, so he earns a True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2009-09-20T19:12:55	2009-09-20	['None']
pomt-01388	The Greenlight Pinellas 1-cent sales tax "is permanent, we never get to vote on this again."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/oct/14/no-tax-tracks/greenlight-pinellas-opponents-says-residents-will-/	When it comes to discussing the Greenlight Pinellas mass transit initiative, two things are certain: Taxes and citizens complaining about taxes. If the measure passes on Election Day, the county’s sales tax would go up 1 cent. So an opposition group has made the alleged unfairness of it all a cornerstone of their campaign. No Tax For Tracks, a grassroots group opposed to Greenlight Pinellas, said in an email to voters that not only is the switch from a property tax for the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority to an increased sales tax unfair, it’s going to last forever. "They call it a ‘tax swap,’ but PSTA's revenue will increase from $32 million per year to $148 million per year," the email reads. "Any financial dictionary will tell you that this is not a ‘tax swap’, this is a revenue increase of over 300 percent! And the tax is permanent, we never get to vote on this again." The group has notably been mindful of its wording here, because they have said in the past that the swap was a "300 percent tax increase." We rated that False, because that number would be the change to the PSTA operating budget, and not any individual taxpayer. Will the tax swap be permanent, though? We decided to find out. The swap The countywide transportation plan aims to expand bus service by adding routes and extending hours, but also would add a 24-mile light rail line between St. Petersburg and Clearwater. In order to pay for the changes, the county’s sales tax would go up from 7 percent to 8 percent, becoming the highest tax rate in the state. Some things, like medicine, groceries, and certain agricultural and manufacturing startup equipment, would be exempt from the sales tax, and the increase would be limited to the first $5,000 of major purchases. This would replace the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority’s current county funding through a property tax. Greenlight Pinellas is different from something like Penny for Pinellas, the county's 1-cent capital improvement tax. The Penny for Pinellas has to be reauthorized by voters every 10 years. Here, the interlocal agreement the PSTA and the county commission created for the plan does not specifically guarantee a future vote on the sales tax increase. The "tax swap," as Greenlight Pinellas organizers call it, would boost the authority’s budget from about $34 million to as high as $120 million to $130 million, PSTA calculates. If voters approve the change in November, the change would take effect Jan. 1, 2016. Any future changes to the Greenlight plan, such as an extension of the proposed rail line or other major alteration, would be subject to a referendum. The property tax technically wouldn’t go away, as the PSTA needs the state to approve its elimination. Gov. Rick Scott vetoed a bill in 2012 that would have done this, getting rid of the property tax and replacing it with the increased sales tax if voters choose. Now, if Greenlight Pinellas passes, the PSTA would set the millage rate to zero and start collecting the sales tax. The property tax could be eliminated by the Legislature in the future, but the fact that it would still exist on property tax bills has led No Tax For Tracks to speculate this could lead to double taxation. Greenlight Pinellas rules say PSTA can’t have both sets of tax revenue. The new sales tax itself stays in place "until repealed," as the ballot language for Nov. 4 says. No Tax For Tracks argues that repeal won’t ever take place, because of how the PSTA and Pinellas County agreed to fund the project. The interlocal agreement says the surtax money can only be used to fund Greenlight projects, PSTA chief development officer Cassandra Borchers told us. It also specifies that the county has to continue to fund PSTA operations and maintenance. There are ways for the tax to be rescinded written into the agreement, however. If the plan isn’t implemented as promised or in the time frame allotted, if the money from the sales tax is used for something other than the Greenlight plan, if there is a payment default or some unforeseen calamity in the future, the tax can be reduced or terminated. It also is slated for review in 50 years, and every 20 years thereafter. But overall, it won’t be easy to stop the tax once it starts. That’s because the tax money is going to pay for a major construction project. Jewel White from the Pinellas County Attorney’s Office said there are clauses written into the contract that allow for decades of guaranteed tax money in order to secure financing for capital projects, like more buses and the proposed light rail line. Unless one of the triggers to end the sales tax is met, the county commission likely wouldn’t examine the issue, White said. Because the sales tax is under the same ordinance that governs initiatives like Penny For Pinellas, it has to be put to voters to be enacted, she said. After that, options for repeal are few. Pinellas residents could ask the commission to address the issue, but that would probably not get any results either, White said. Residents could not force the commission to put the issue back on the ballot. "Certainly, anyone can approach the commission at any time," she said. "Once money gets bonded, though, it’s pretty hard to undo." No Tax For Tracks activists also said these steps are wholly improbable, because if the county ended the tax, they would have to find some way to continue to pay its obligations to PSTA. Borchers agreed that just ending the sales tax or reinstituting the property tax -- which would bring in much less money for the operating budget -- would result in major problems. "You couldn’t just stop it without some consequences," Borchers said, noting that not only is the operating budget at issue, there is a lot of promised state and federal money tied up in the plan. "You’d have to pay back all those grants." Our ruling No Tax For Tracks said the Greenlight Pinellas 1-cent sales tax "is permanent, we never get to vote on this again." There is no clause or provision in the proposal that allows for another vote. However, saying the tax is "permanent" also goes too far. While it is certainly likely that the sales tax would be in place for the foreseeable future if passed, the tax has a review clause set for 50 years from now. The long time frame is because the taxes are dedicated to paying for major long-term construction projects like light rail. As to whether the county commission would ever bring the question back to voters, it’s improbable but not impossible. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.	None	No Tax For Tracks	None	None	None	2014-10-14T18:01:09	2014-09-30	['None']
pomt-10144	"Obama held one of the first meetings of his political career in Bill Ayers's home. And they've worked together on various projects in Chicago."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/06/sarah-palin/obama-and-ayers-round-ii/	We at PolitiFact wondered when the toaster would pop on the William Ayers -Sen. Barack Obama connection. Back in the primary, Sens. Hillary Clinton and John McCain made some political hay of Obama’s relationship with Ayers, a onetime member of the Weather Underground, a leftist fringe of the 1960s antiwar movement that was responsible for bombings at several federal buildings in the early 1970s. PolitiFact looked at the claim then and found from 1999 to 2001, Obama and Ayers served overlapping terms on the board of directors for the Woods Fund, a philanthropic organization in Chicago. We also noted that campaign finance reports show Ayers donated $200 to Obama’s state senate re-election campaign in 2001. Since the general election began, the McCain campaign had largely kept the issue on the shelf. But with the economy sagging and McCain’s numbers dipping in the polls, an Oct. 3, 2008, a story in the New York Times that added some new details to the association between the two provided the McCain campaign just enough kindling to revisit Obama’s long-ago association with the controversial figure. And now, Gov. Sarah Palin is running with it. "Well, I was reading my copy of The New York Times the other day, and I was really interested to read about Barack’s friends from Chicago," Palin said at a rally in Clearwater, Fla., on Oct. 6. "Turns out, one of his earliest supporters is a man named Bill Ayers. And according to The New York Times , he was a domestic terrorist and part of a group that, quote, ‘launched a campaign of bombings that would target the Pentagon and the U.S. Capitol.’ Wow. "And there’s even more to the story," Palin said. "Barack Obama said Ayers was just someone in the neighborhood. But that’s less than truthful. His own top advisor said they were, quote, ‘certainly friendly.’ In fact, Obama held one of the first meetings of his political career in Bill Ayers’s home. And they’ve worked together on various projects in Chicago." First, a little background on Ayers. He was, in fact, a founding member of a group known as the Weathermen, who were responsible for bombings of the New York City police headquarters in 1970, of the Capitol building in 1971 and of the Pentagon in 1972 in protest of the Vietnam War. Ayers and his wife, Bernardine Dohrn, also a Weather Underground member, spent years as fugitives in the 1970s, but federal riot and bombing conspiracy charges were dropped in 1974 because of illegal wiretaps and other prosecutorial misconduct. Since then, Ayers has rehabilitated his image with many in the Chicago community, including Mayor Richard M. Daley. Ayers is now a professor of education at the University of Illinois at Chicago and has developed a reputation as an advocate for school reform. Which is, according to Ben LaBolt, an Obama campaign spokesman, how the two met. The recent New York Times story added to the understanding of Obama's association with Ayers, through an education project. Ayers helped Chicago win nearly $50 million for Chicago schools as part of a national school reform project, the Chicago Annenberg Challenge. In March 1995, Obama was named chair of the six-member Chicago Annenberg Challenge board that distributed the grants. A New York Times review of archives of the Chicago Annenberg project found that the two attended six board meetings together. Later that year, the Ayers’ hosted a coffee at which Illinois State Sen. Alice Palmer, who planned to run for Congress, introduced Obama to some of her long-time supporters as her chosen successor. According to the New York Times story, it was one of several neighborhood events held that year on Obama’s behalf, and it was not the first. Obama campaign officials also note the event at Ayers’ home was not a fundraiser. And they claim that Obama did not know Ayers’ history with the Weather Underground at that time. They did not say when Obama found that out. Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt told PolitiFact the two have not communicated by phone or e-mail since Obama became a U.S. senator in 2005, and that they last spoke to one another about a year ago, when they bumped into each other in the neighborhood - they live just a few blocks apart. "The suggestion that Ayers was a political adviser to Obama or someone who shaped his political views is patently false," LaBolt said. "As the New York Times confirmed, the two were not close." Asked about his relationship at a Democratic debate on April 16, 2008, Obama said, "This is a guy who lives in my neighborhood, who’s a professor of English in Chicago who I know and who I have not received some official endorsement from. He’s not somebody who I exchange ideas from on a regular basis. "And the notion that somehow as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago, when I was 8 years old, somehow reflects on me and my values doesn’t make much sense." For what it’s worth, the story Palin cited in her comments, the Oct. 3, 2008, New York Times piece, concluded after a review of Chicago Annenberg archives and interviews with a dozen people who know both men, that Obama "has played down his contacts with Mr. Ayers...But the two men do not appear to have been close. Nor has Mr. Obama ever expressed sympathy for the radical views and actions of Mr. Ayers." In previous speeches the day before her appearance in Clearwater, Palin accused Obama of "palling around with terrorists." We think that statement goes too far, and is just false, as there is no evidence that Obama has had any relationship with Ayers as a U.S. senator. But let’s review what Palin said in Clearwater, and weigh it against the facts as we know them. Palin called Ayers one of Obama’s "earliest supporters" and said Obama "held one of the first meetings of his political career in Bill Ayers’ home." Obama campaign officials acknowledge Ayers hosted a coffee in 1995, the purpose of which was to introduce Obama to some local political players leading up to his first run for public office. Obama campaign officials say Obama didn’t know Ayers’ past at that time, and McCain campaign officials wonder why this week was the first time that has ever been mentioned. Make of that what you will, but that part of Palin’s statement is true. Palin said Ayers was a "domestic terrorist." The Weather Undergound group was labeled a "domestic terrorist group" by the FBI, and Ayers was a founding member of the group, but charges against him were dropped due to prosecutorial misconduct. Palin said Obama claimed Ayers was "just someone in the neighborhood," but her remark ignored Obama's condemnation of Ayers in that very sentence she quotes. Obama did seem to downplay his relationship with Ayers, stating that he was "a guy who lives in my neighborhood," but Obama in that same answer acknowledged that he knew Ayers and called his actions 40 years ago "detestable" and said they do not reflect his own values. Lastly, Palin said Obama and Ayers have "worked together on various projects in Chicago." They were both involved with the Chicago Annenberg Challenge. And they both served for a time as directors of the Woods Fund. Neither chose the other to work with either group. Voters can decide for themselves how much stock to put in all that. And they may disagree with the implications that are inherent in Palin mentioning such connections. Palin generally has her facts right here, but she ignores an important element -- Obama's condemnation of Ayers' history -- and implies a closer relationship than the record supports. We find her claim Mostly True.	None	Sarah Palin	None	None	None	2008-10-06T00:00:00	2008-10-06	['Chicago', 'Barack_Obama', 'Bill_Ayers']
pomt-11314	"Greitens accuser admits photo session may have been a ‘dream.’ "	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/13/sentinel/headline-about-greitens-accuser-sex-case-doesn/	Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens is expected to go to trial in May on a felony indictment of invasion of privacy related to an allegation that he took a photo of a woman who was partially nude without her consent. Greitens admitted the extramarital affair with his former hairdresser in January, but described it as consensual and denied allegations that he threatened her. Greitens, a combat veteran and a Republican, was elected governor in 2016. How Greitens behaved during the affair, and especially whether he had specific sexual interactions with the woman without her consent, have become key points of dispute. An April 8 headline on the Sentinel, a website that writes about government in Missouri, said that his accuser "admits photo session may have been a dream." Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found news reports show the woman did make this statement in a deposition, but the Sentinel omitted a complete explanation about the woman’s testimony. The Sentinel quoted from a few paragraphs in a defense motion filed on behalf of Greitens April 8. When the defense counsel asked the woman, "Did you ever see (Greitens) in possession of a camera or phone?" she answered: "Not to my knowledge. I didn’t see him with it." An assistant circuit attorney asked the woman, "Did you see what you believed to be a phone?" She answered, "… I haven’t talked about it because I don’t know if it’s because I’m remembering it through a dream or I – I’m not sure, but yes, I feel like I saw it after that happened, but I haven’t spoken about it because of that." Jack Cashill, co-editor of the Sentinel, told PolitiFact that he didn’t have the full deposition and relied on excerpts in the court filing. "It is for this reason I used the subjunctive in the headline ‘may have,’ " he said, noting that other news outlets including the Daily Mail used a similar approach in headlines. Greitens has seized on the dream portion of the woman’s statement, telling media that the case is "a political witch hunt now based on the testimony of somebody who said under oath that they may be remembering this through a dream." Other news reports state that that the woman’s testimony came during a deposition that lasted for several hours. The Associated Press wrote that "the prosecutor in the case says the defense ‘cherry picked bits and pieces’ of her nine-hour deposition and the woman's attorney says the comment referred to one particular instance concerning the photo." The Missouri House committee investigation into the allegations against Greitens also mentioned the dream comment, but stated in a footnote that the committee "includes these quotes in the absence of a full transcript from the deposition." The woman told the committee that during an encounter with Greitens, "I can hear like a, like a cell phone – like a picture, and I can see a flash through the blindfold." The committee concluded that the woman was a credible witness. Greitens did not testify before the House committee. St. Louis Circuit Judge Rex Burlison issued a gag order in the case which prohibits comments related to the deposition and requires the judge to sign off on certain court filings before they're made public. Without the deposition, we can’t fully evaluate the woman’s comments. The woman’s attorney, Scott Simpson, said in statement to media that the woman supports the release of the full transcript. Simpson said that Greitens "has admitted to my client, on multiple occasions that he took her photograph without her consent, and threatened to release it if she ever told anyone about their relationship." Our ruling A headline by the Sentinel website said that "Greitens accuser admits photo session may have been a ‘dream.’ " News articles state that the woman made that comment during a lengthy deposition. Since we don’t have a transcript of the deposition, it is difficult to evaluate her comment but it appears to be cherry-picking from a deposition that lasted several hours.

pomt-08881	"As President George W. Bush’s trade representative, Portman failed to address China’s currency manipulation, which was inflated to as much as 40 percent in 2006."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2010/aug/02/lee-fisher/fisher-claim-portman-failed-address-china-currency/	China makes the goods that Americans used to make, but that’s because politicians failed to stop China’s unfair trade practices. It’s a theme as recurrent as the buzzards returning to Hinckley, and Ohio campaign managers know it works. But Lee Fisher’s campaign presented a new angle on the theme, and it is intriguing. Fisher, the Democratic lieutenant governor, is running for U.S. Senate against Rob Portman, a Republican who served for a year as President George W. Bush’s trade ambassador. Portman played a key advisory role in helping the president deal with economic competition from China, whose manufacturing might rose as Ohio’s declined. You’ll hear plenty more about that before November, and The Plain Dealer examined Portman’s trade record in May. But Fisher presented a brand new perspective in a news release on July 13 when he complained about currency manipulation by China. Although this has been an issue for years, Fisher put some of the blame on Portman. His news release said, "As President George W. Bush’s trade representative, Portman failed to address China’s currency manipulation, which was inflated to as much as 40 percent in 2006." That’s shorthand for saying that China propped up its currency rather than letting it rise and fall against the dollar, enabling China’s factories to make steel, auto parts and toys and ship them to the United States at artificially low prices that undercut American manufacturers. It was little different from other unfair trade practices, many American manufacturers say. You’ll hear few disputes about that, whether the president is named Bush or Barack Obama. But there’s plenty of bickering over what to do about it. That’s where Portman comes in. Portman, a Republican, could have used his authority as trade representative to take China to the World Trade Organization and push for penalties, according to critics. But Portman was such an unabashed proponent of free trade that he gave China a pass, Fisher says. We asked Fisher’s spokesman, John Collins (who recently left to work for a candidate in Kentucky), to provide support for the claim, and he cited several news articles from early 2006. That’s when Portman’s office issued a lengthy and critical report on other trade practices by China. But Portman’s report gave little space to currency manipulation – and that angered Sen. Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York. According to news articles and congressional transcripts we reviewed, Schumer blasted Portman’s report for failing to fully deal with the "800-pound gorilla" – currency manipulation -- that had to be tamed for any trade balance to occur. OK, so Portman failed to adequately mention China’s currency manipulation -- according to a senator from New York -- in a report. Was that really a failure to "address" the problem? It turns out the issue gets more complex. Portman didn’t address the currency issue in the broader sense -- that is, embrace it as a problem he could solve -- because, his campaign says, it wasn’t even under his jurisdiction. Transcripts of a confirmation hearing for Portman on April 21, 2005, show that he voiced concern about the issue but said, "By the same token, as you know, the Treasury Department has the lead on this, appropriately. It’s a currency issue, not USTR," he said, using the initials of U.S. Trade Representative’s office. He mentioned the jurisdictional issue several more times during his stint as trade ambassador. On Feb. 16, 2006, he told Schumer during a Senate Finance Committee hearing that "currency policy is very distinctly not within the ambit of the USTR. And I'm reminded of that constantly in the inter-agency process, which is appropriate that Treasury take the lead and that they speak for us on currency policy." Four days later he told it to another congressional committee: "We need to address the currency issue, which the Treasury Department takes the lead on and not USTR." So is Fisher blaming Portman for something he bore no responsibility for? That’s what Portman’s spokeswoman, Jessica Towhey, suggested, citing the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. The act says it is the Treasury secretary’s job to analyze exchange rate policies of other countries, in consultation with the International Monetary Fund, and consider whether countries manipulate their currencies. If the answer is yes, Treasury is to negotiate with the offending country through the IMF. We contacted the office of the current trade representative, Ron Kirk, an Obama appointee, to see if it agreed on the jurisdiction issue. It did. We asked Treasury as well, and Treasury said it was in fact in charge. We asked the Obama White House, too, just in case the agencies had a fuzzy view. No, said the White House. Currency manipulation is on Treasury’s watch. That cast significant doubt on Fisher’s claim, then, that Portman "failed to address" the problem. It wasn’t his job. But we wondered if small American manufacturers agreed, so we asked a few trade experts in Washington, including attorneys who take cases to the trade courts. It turned out that the story was more complex, because on April 20, 2005, nine days before Portman was sworn in, a group of 35 senators and representatives filed a petition asking the trade representative’s office to haul China before the WTO and press the currency issue as an unfair trade practice. The Congress members -- nearly all Democrats -- had grown frustrated with Treasury, saying it had failed to stop China’s manipulation and that the right recourse was for the trade ambassador to go to the trade courts and ask for tariffs against Chinese imports. A coalition of labor unions and manufacturing groups had tried this twice before, but their petitions had been rejected. But this 2005 congressional petition was different because members of Congress filed it. They included several U.S. House members from Ohio, including Democrats Tim Ryan, Stephanie Tubbs Jones (since deceased), Sherrod Brown (now a senator) and Ted Strickland (now Ohio’s governor). They also included a dozen U.S. senators, including one from Illinois named Barack Obama. On May 27, 2005, not quite a month into his term, Portman’s office turned them down. His spokesman at the agency, Richard Mills, said at the time that the Treasury secretary, John Snow, had the lead in talks with China on the currency matter and, as a result, "Chinese officials have publicly committed that they will move to a more flexible system." A notice in the Federal Register said the trade office turned down the lawmakers’ request "because, among other reasons, an investigation would not be effective in addressing the acts, policies, and practices covered in the petition." The Bush administration was already dealing with China through Treasury, and launching a trade office investigation "would hamper, rather than advance, administration efforts to address China’s currency valuation policies." Neither Mills’ statement nor the Federal Register notice said it was strictly a matter of jurisdiction. Mills said at the time that many tools were available "to ensure a level playing field," but that the administration preferred to put Treasury in the lead. This suggested some leeway on choice, not just jurisdiction, or so say the parties who wanted the trade representative’s involvement. "That is a major issue, and we’ve always argued that it is a hybrid issue," says David Hartquist, a Washington trade attorney who had filed a similar petition earlier that was turned down by a Portman predecessor.. Charles Blum, a trade office official in the 1980s who is now executive director of the Fair Currency Coalition, representing manufacturers, labor and agricultural interests, says that Portman "was essentially saying, ‘I refuse to enforce the law because diplomacy is the proper venue.’" The question then becomes: Did Portman lack jurisdiction, or did he just believe that Treasury was the better agency to deal with the issue? Kevin Dempsey, a trade lawyer and senior vice president at the American Iron and Steel Institute, which also has tried to halt unfairly priced imports, says that Congress has been fairly clear: It intended for Treasury to take the lead. Portman "had some discretion," Dempsey says. "But it’s been established for some years, before Portman and after Portman, that Treasury does have the lead." Congress has considered changing that so currency could be treated as a trade issue in certain circumstances. Ryan and Brown are involved in these efforts. But their measures have stalled repeatedly. And now that he’s president, even Obama has kept Treasury in the lead – and frustrated those who want more forceful action. So we’re persuaded that in a narrow sense, Portman "failed to address China’s currency manipulation," as Fisher’s campaign says. But he was following a long-held policy that has been articulated by Congress and presidents. The Obama administration agrees with Portman: Currency is not the trade ambassador’s job. And Portman "addressed" it repeatedly in congressional hearings, telling Congress exactly what his campaign says today. That’s why we rate Fisher’s claim Barely True. Comment on this item. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05505	Georgia is one of three states that "effectively have no regulations whatsoever on lobbyists giving to legislators."	true	/georgia/statements/2012/apr/15/joshua-mckoon/no-limit-gifts-ga-legislature-senator-says/	Georgia state Sen. Joshua McKoon, by some accounts, committed political suicide this year. The freshman Republican from Columbus proposed legislation to cap gifts from lobbyists to state lawmakers at $100. Statehouse leaders apparently didn’t care for his approach, removing McKoon from a committee to study the idea. There’s been mumbling, as one former senator put it, that Republicans were recruiting a candidate to run against McKoon. "I have not been making a lot of friends inside the Capitol," McKoon said, when asked by PolitiFact Georgia about his proposal. Throughout the legislative session, McKoon attempted to buttress his argument with a fact to help fellow lawmakers see the light. Georgia, he said, is one of three states that "effectively have no regulations whatsoever on lobbyists giving to legislators." The other states, he says, are Indiana and South Dakota. McKoon held a news conference last month and pointed to a map of the United States with those three states in red. So, is McKoon correct? Government watchdog groups have argued ardently in recent years that Georgia needs to tighten its ethics laws and make it more difficult for lobbyists to influence state lawmakers with gifts of meals or trips. A recent joint report by the Center for Public Integrity and Global Integrity ranked Georgia last in the nation in the strength of its laws on public corruption and government openness. Some state lawmakers called the report biased. Georgia code section 21-5-11 spells out the policy on gifts. It says that only statewide elected officials can accept gifts of more than $100 for a speech, seminar or panel discussion that directly relates to the duties of that official, but prohibits it otherwise. It states no rules for members of the Georgia Legislature or other types of gifts. A section on prohibited lobbying practices, Title 28, Chapter 7, mentions nothing about gift limits. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution took a close look at lobbyists during the recent legislative session. A recent AJC story found lobbyists spent $866,747 --- the equivalent of $9,525 per day --- on gifts for lawmakers from Jan. 1 through March 31. Many of the gifts would have easily surpassed the $100 limit McKoon proposed. For example, the AJC found lobbyists took Rep. Mickey Channell, R-Greensboro, and his wife to dinner on Valentine’s Day, spending about $230. Another House member, Rahn Mayo, D-Decatur, said he was unaware that the four Atlanta Hawks basketball tickets that lobbyists gave him cost about $500. House Speaker David Ralston has defended the current system, saying eliminating lobbying gifts would drive the practice "underground," where the public would know less about what is happening between lawmakers and special interests. So how does Georgia compare with other states when it comes to laws on gifts from lobbyists? The National Conference of State Legislatures has a chart that examines gift policy in each state. McKoon said he used the NCSL chart to make his claim. Many states employ what’s referred to as the "cup of coffee" policy, which prohibits any gifts whatsoever from lobbyists. About a dozen states set the limit at $100. Four states set the limit at $250. A handful limit gifts from lobbyists to between $250 and $1,000. The NCSL chart says Indiana requires lobbyists to report gifts, but does not specify any limits of what they can give lawmakers. In 2010, state lawmakers changed some of the rules on gifts from lobbyists. They must now disclose any gifts in a day greater than $50. Before, the limit was $100, said Julia Vaughn, Common Cause Indiana policy director. "We don’t limit. We require some disclosure," Vaughn said. Vaughn said some state lawmakers argue a gift ban isn’t necessary because it’s better for the public to know what they’re getting from lobbyists. In South Dakota, the code section on lobbyists mentions nothing about gift limits for lobbyists. The NCSL lists South Dakota as having "no restrictions." We found no discrepancies in the NCSL’s research. The current laws in Georgia, Indiana and South Dakota afford lobbyists freedom to give state lawmakers as much as they want. We rate McKoon’s claim as True.	None	Josh McKoon	None	None	None	2012-04-15T06:00:00	2012-04-03	['None']
pomt-03838	Rhode Island is the last state still using the Optech III P voting machines and they don’t meet suggested federal standards.	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/mar/16/robert-kando/head-rhode-island-board-elections-says-state-last-/	Robert Kando, executive director of the Rhode Island Board of Elections, appeared before the House Oversight Committee earlier this month as it continued its inquiry into what caused long lines at some polling places during the November general election. Among suggestions Kando made to ease problems in the future was replacing the machines Rhode Island uses at its voting precincts to count ballots. The optical scanners -- known by their trade name, the Optech III P Eagle -- were purchased in 1997. In fact, said Kando, Rhode Island is the last state still using them and they don’t meet the suggested standards set by the federal Help America Vote Act, known as HAVA. Kando’s comments, implying that our voting machines are deficient, caught our attention. When we contacted Kando he was adamant that Rhode Island is the last state still using the Optech III P Eagles. But he was less sure what exactly made our voting machines non-compliant with some new -- and the important word here is "voluntary" -- federal guidelines for voting machines. "You would have to be an engineer to figure that out," he replied. Kando said he would contact the company that maintained Rhode Island’s machines -- Election Systems and Software (ES&S), based in Nebraska -- and get back to us with the reasons. In the meantime, we did some research. Congress passed the Help America Vote Act in 2002 in response to the "hanging chad" debacle of the 2000 presidential election. In that contest between George W. Bush and Al Gore, confusion with reading paper ballots in Florida and deciphering voters’ intent eventually led to the U.S. Supreme Court intervening and stopping the recount, putting Bush in the White House. HAVA provided money to states to upgrade their voting systems to assure a higher level of accuracy, a better recount system and improved access for voters with disabilities. The act also created a new federal agency called the Elections Assistance Commission to advise states on how to comply with HAVA. The commission wrote up some technical guidelines for voting machines -- dealing with among other things software and electrical capabilities -- but made these guidelines voluntary. States could use the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines if they wanted to have the EAC certify that their voting machines met HAVA requirements. But states such as Rhode Island, which used machines purchased before the 2002 HAVA requirements, weren’t required to do so. We found through various sources, including verifiedvoting.org, that more than 200 counties and communities in at least at least seven other states -- Alabama, Idaho, Indiana, Massachusetts, Maine, Wisconsin and Virginia -- were still using Optech III P Eagle voting machines. (Unlike Rhode Island, most states don’t use the same machine statewide.) We also checked in with Rhode Island’s Secretary of State A. Ralph Mollis on whether our voting machines meet the voluntary standards. Spokesman Chris Barnett wouldn’t answer that question directly, but issued a general statement: "We agree that Rhode Island’s voting machines are beyond their useful life," and he said his office hoped the machines would be replaced before the next election in 2014. Finally Kando forwarded to us an e-mail he had received from ES&S which cited three specific areas in which Rhode Island’s voting machines were "non-compliant" with the voluntary standards. And we quote: "No operating system -- all OS type functions included in the assembler firmware" "No life cycle counter" "No poll open process - power on allows ballots to be read." When we asked Kando to explain, noting that legislators would likely need something in English if they were to approve spending $5 million to replace the machines, Kando replied: "While I have my own understanding of the three deficiencies . . . I am fearful that any answer that I provide will be dissected to uncover any flaw and that the best source of information is the vendor." In a phone interview, Kathy A. Rogers, vice president of government affairs with ES&S, explained the three deficiencies. "No operating system . . . " pertains to the machine’s aging hardware and software no longer being capable of tabulating votes at the speed and efficiency the suggested standards recommend. "No life cycle counter" means that Rhode Island’s machines, unlike newer models, can’t keep a running count of how many votes were counted through them in their lifetimes. And finally "no poll open process" concerns turning the machines on. For security reasons, the standards require that voting machines have a password or a lock system in order to turn them on. The Optech Eagles, however, "were designed to begin counting ballots as soon as you plugged it in," said Rogers In a follow up interview, Kando said the point he was trying to make with his statement is that Rhode Island’s voting machines are substandard, not obsolete. They still assure "an accurate and fair" tabulation of votes, he said. And ES&S did say in an e-mail to Kando that while the machines don’t comply with some new standards, they are "performing accurately, reliably and securely if used and maintained according to recommendations." Our ruling Robert Kando said that Rhode Island is the only state still using the Optech III P Eagle voting machine, and that the machines do not meet suggested federal standards. He’s wrong on the first count: a quick search found at least seven other states still using the old machines. He’s right on the second: the vendor confirmed to us that the machines aren’t compliant with some voluntary federal standards. We rule his statement Half True.

pomt-12475	Donald Trump’s "golf course on the island defaulted, like so many of his other failed business schemes. The failure left Puerto Rican taxpayers with a nearly $33 million bill."	half-true	/florida/statements/2017/may/04/florida-democratic-party/did-bankrupt-trump-golf-course-puerto-rico-leave-t/	President Donald Trump accused Democrats of using Puerto Rico’s debt as a bargaining chip before the deadline to settle the federal budget. "The Democrats want to shut government if we don't bail out Puerto Rico and give billions to their insurance companies for OCare failure. NO!" Trump tweeted April 27. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Trump appeared to be referring to an effort by Democrats including Florida Sen. Bill Nelson to address a Medicaid shortfall in Puerto Rico, which became the largest municipal bankruptcy May 3. The Florida Democratic Party fired back at Trump’s tweet in a press release suggesting that Trump shares blame in the island’s economic downfall. A Trump golf resort, the party said, crashed in Puerto Rico and hurt taxpayers. "Trump conveniently left out the fact that his golf course on the island defaulted, like so many of his other failed business schemes. The failure left Puerto Rican taxpayers with a nearly $33 million bill, another example of Trump's many scams that make him wealthier and con hardworking families," the party wrote. Did Trump really leave the island with a bungled investment? We found that the bankruptcy of the golf resort did leave taxpayers with a bill, and that Trump had pledged to turn things around. But the Democrats portrayed the situation in a misleading light by omitting that the business was in dire financial straits years before Trump entered the picture. The Trump family has tried to create space in the years since between the resort and their business. Golf resort’s pre-Trump financial woes The resort in Rio Grande opened as Coco Beach Golf & Country Club in 2004 and ultimately included two 18-hole golf courses and a clubhouse. Trump entered the picture in 2008. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com The resort was built with support from the Puerto Rican government through the Puerto Rico Tourism Development Fund. The fund issued about $25 million in bonds in 2000 and 2004, according to a 2016 BuzzFeed article that included documents about the golf resort’s bankruptcy. The tourism development fund is paid for by tax dollars. If a private entity defaults on its obligations -- as the golf resort did in this case -- the fund has to make good on the principal and interest. The resort suffered amid the recession that hit Puerto Rico a few years before Trump got involved. To learn more about what went wrong, we interviewed Craig McCann, a principal at Securities Litigation and Consulting Group, who has testified several times in arbitrations about Puerto Rican municipal bonds but has had no role in this particular case. McCann was a key source for the BuzzFeed article, and his firm reviewed annual financial reports that were included. The recession in Puerto Rico was much worse than the mainland and started earlier as manufacturers left in 2006-07 due to the elimination of a tax subsidy for manufacturers, McCann told PolitiFact. Then the island got a second financial hit, this time rattled by the recession in the United States. The resort lost about $5.7 million in 2007 and $6.3 million in 2008. "This resort just got hammered and is hemorrhaging money before the Trump Organization’s involvement," McCann told PolitiFact. As the losses piled up, property owners went looking for help. Enter Trump. Problems continued under Trump In 2008, Trump signed two deals: a licensing agreement to rename the club as Trump International Golf Club Puerto Rico, and a management agreement to position Trump to handle the club’s operations in exchange for a share of its annual revenue and a slice of the profit. A document stated that as manager, Trump International Co had developed a plan to maintain positive operating cash flow. Trump claimed more than $600,000 in profits by the end of 2012. "Puerto Rico is a fantastic place and deserves the best, which is what we will deliver," Trump said at a 2008 news conference on the island, according to the Washington Post. "Every detail will be important to me." It isn’t clear from the documents how involved Trump really was. It is clear, however, that he didn’t solve the resort’s problems. There was at least one bright spot as the resort racked up losses: The course landed on the PGA tour in 2008. But in 2011, the resort sought more bonds to repay the earlier bonds. McCann said that even if Trump had not gotten involved, the resort was headed toward bankruptcy because the 2000 and 2004 bonds were about to default. In 2015, the resort filed for bankruptcy under its original name, the Coco Beach Golf and Country Club. The resort claimed it owed more than $78 million but only had $9 million in assets. Johanna Cervone, spokeswoman for the Democrats, says Trump was brought in to save the golf course but left taxpayers on the hook. "He was tasked with turning it around, he made revenue off of it, and it failed," she said. Eric Trump distanced his father from the project when it fell into bankruptcy "We have zero financial investment in this course," Eric Trump told Bloomberg News in July 2015. "This has absolutely nothing to do with Trump. This is a separate owner. We purely manage the golf course." (Eric Trump filed a bankruptcy claim for about $927,000 for unpaid fees on behalf of Trump Golf Coco Beach LLC.) Bankruptcy court records show that the Puerto Rico Tourism Development Fund, the largest creditor, filed a claim for $32.67 million for the real estate mortgage in 2015. The resort later sold for about $2 million to OHorizons Global, a private investment firm. This left the Government Development Bank -- the tourism fund is a subsidiary of the bank -- to make payments on the outstanding bonds. We sent a summary of the golf course’s financial problems to a few experts and asked if Trump should be blamed for the bankruptcy. (These experts on bankruptcy or corporate law received our summary with links to news reports but didn’t pore over financial records for days, as McCann’s firm did.) John A. E. Pottow, a University of Michigan law professor and bankruptcy expert, said Trump bears some blame for the failure of the golf course because he failed to turn it around. But he said it is debatable if management is to blame for bankruptcy because the context of the recession is a factor. "I don't know if I like to ‘blame’ anyone for bankruptcy, but to the extent you want to blame people, sure, blame the president (or his company)," Pottow said. Miami attorney Milton Vescovacci, of Gray Robinson law firm, says the only way to blame Trump for the bankruptcy would be if his involvement was so costly to the operation that it caused the business to fail, and that didn’t appear to be the case here. (Vescovacci is an expert on banking and finance and is currently working with an organization to lobby the U.S. government to allow Puerto Rico to restructure its debt) The golf course bankruptcy is different from bankruptcies of multiple Trump casinos, McCann said. With the casinos, Trump was a major investor and had a significant role such as controlling shareholder or as an executive. In Puerto Rico, he said, "The Trump Organization was providing services and a brand all for a fee. No equity interest. No deep involvement." The Trump Organization sent PolitiFact a statement: "The Trump Organization was neither the owner nor the developer of this property and had nothing to do with the financing of the development. Our role was to operate and manage the property." Our ruling The Florida Democratic Party said that Trump’s "golf course on the island defaulted, like so many of his other failed business schemes. The failure left Puerto Rican taxpayers with a nearly $33 million bill." Trump entered into a licensing and management agreement in 2008 -- after the golf course resort had fallen into debt. Trump failed to turn around the resort and it declared bankruptcy in 2015. The Puerto Rico Tourism Development Fund, which provided project financing in 2000 and 2004, filed a claim in bankruptcy court for $32.7 million. The fund is paid for with tax dollars. The Democratic Party is correct that taxpayers are left with a nearly $33 million bill, but it exaggerates when it points the finger exclusively at Trump, omitting important details about the recession’s impact on the resort and its financial woes years before Trump’s involvement.

pomt-03941	"Nobody in total is proposing cutting anything. We’re trying to reduce the rate of growth in government."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/feb/20/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-says-republican-budget-proposals-dont-/	Making the rounds reacting to President Barack Obama’s State of the Union speech, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson was asked why Republicans didn’t "cut their way to solvency" during the Bush administration in the 1990s. Johnson, a deficit hawk elected in 2010, reacted to the word "cut." "Nobody in total is proposing cutting anything. We’re trying to reduce the rate of growth in government," he said Feb. 13, 2013, on public radio station WUWM-FM (89.7) in Milwaukee. "And that’s what we need to do. The fact of the matter is, the extreme position is to do nothing on either Social Security or Medicare, because those programs are going broke." The bitter partisan warfare over who is cutting what and by how much can obscure the true nature of various deficit-relief plans. So let’s test Johnson’s claim that "nobody in total is proposing cutting anything." Rather, he claims, officials are "trying to reduce the rate of growth in government." In the case of Johnson, we’ve been down this road before, but with the shoe on the other foot. In defeating liberal Democrat Russ Feingold in 2010, it was Johnson who portrayed limits on spending growth in Medicare -- supported by Feingold in the federal health care law -- as "cuts" that would harm seniors. Now it’s Johnson who complains that critics misconstrue caps on the rate of spending growth as "cuts." Such is politics. But let’s look at the core issue raised by Johnson’s comments. In Johnson’s two years, have he and fellow Republicans advocated limits on federal spending growth -- or have they actually tried to shrink the budget from its current size? Over the next decade, looking at federal spending as a whole, it’s clear that the intent is to slow the growth rate. You can see that in U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget proposals, in the sequester set to take effect in March 2013 and in various spending-cap proposals pushed by Republican lawmakers. To be sure, the measures propose significant and often controversial reductions in spending over multiple years compared with current rates of growth, but they do not shrink the budget below current spending over the course of a decade. A few Johnson-specific examples: He supported both Ryan budgets. He signed onto the Contract from America plan to put a per-capita inflation cap on spending growth. He backed a spending-cap proposal by U.S. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) that tied spending to economic growth. And Johnson’s comments in various forums, most recently in January, make clear he endorses limits on total growth. In the Ryan budgets, it’s notable that in the first year of the 10-year projections, his blueprints called for spending less in year one than the year before. Federal budget plans typically are framed in 10-year increments, though, and spending rises in every year but the first under his plans. So Johnson’s point is not knocked down by this, but it’s something to consider when evaluating his claim. It’s also worth noting that Johnson praised the 2012 Ryan proposal but said it wasn’t aggressive enough in limiting growth. When you look more narrowly at specific categories of spending, instead of the whole budget, Ryan’s proposals did indeed make actual year-to-year cuts -- and over the long-term. Example: Ryan’s fiscal year 2012 plan proposed a cut in Medicaid outlays for that year, and didn’t get them back to the previous level until 2019. And Ryan’s 2012 plan cut non-defense discretionary programs by 25 percent over 10 years. Johnson, for his part, has endorsed enormous cuts on an agency-by-agency basis -- and even talks of eliminating some agencies entirely. In a January 2013 interview with The Daily Caller, Johnson said he’d go across the board. "I truly believe that any of these agencies could easily withstand a 10 or 20 percent across the board cut and still be able to perform their function," he told reporter Alex Pappas. Pappas quoted Johnson saying "an awful lot of these" agencies "probably have a harmful effect on the economy anyways, so I don’t necessarily want to maintain their function." Johnson has also scoffed at the size of the looming cuts called for in the sequester, which supposedly was a poison pill so horrible that it would force lawmakers to compromise to avoid swallowing the automatic, across-the-board cuts. A recent Congressional Budget Office estimate said the sequester would cost the United States 750,000 jobs in 2013 alone. Johnson said the sequester’s cuts over 10 years amount to "barely a rounding error" in the giant federal budget. He spoke on WTMJ-AM (620) radio in Milwaukee on February 14, 2013, about the sequester, which totals more than $1 trillion over a decade. So it’s clear Johnson supports steep budget cuts in some areas in order to slow the overall budget’s growth curve. Our rating Johnson said: "Nobody in total is proposing cutting anything. We’re trying to reduce the rate of growth in government." While Johnson supports deep cutbacks in some budget areas, he and fellow Republicans repeatedly have made clear that in Washington budget-speak -- which typically covers 10-year increments -- they are talking about limiting the size of future spending increases. Those growth limits likely would mean significant program changes and fewer federal employees. But the budget would still grow overall. We’ve examined similar claims. PolitiFact National debunked Democrats’ claims in 2011 that Ryan’s budget would "end" Medicare. And it declared Mostly False claims in 2010 by Republicans that the federal health care law cut hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicare at the elderly’s expense. Both ratings rested in part on the recognition that Medicare’s budget would continue to grow, just at a slower pace, under the cost-savings plans. Johnson’s claim is something of a reverse image of those claims, though on a grander scale. With the points of clarification noted above, we think his main point is on target. We rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Ron Johnson	None	None	None	2013-02-20T09:00:00	2013-02-13	['None']
pomt-03328	"Homicides against blacks have tripled" since Florida’s "stand your ground" law has been in existence.	false	/florida/statements/2013/jul/24/jesse-jackson/homicides-blacks-have-tripled-stand-your-ground-wa/	Rev. Jesse Jackson called for a boycott of Florida, which he labeled an "apartheid state" after George Zimmerman was acquitted in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin. "No doubt ... the inclination (is) to boycott Florida, to stop conventions, to isolate Florida as a kind of apartheid state given this whole 'stand your ground' laws,"Jackson said on CNN July 18. "Homicides against blacks have tripled since this law has been in existence. Now more homicides and more guns make us less secure." On July 13, a jury acquitted Zimmerman, a white Hispanic volunteer neighborhood watchman, in the death of Martin, an unarmed black teenager killed in Sanford in 2012. Zimmerman claimed self-defense. The case has sparked much discussion about the impact of the "stand your ground" law in Florida -- particularly for the black community. After Jackson made his remarks, several readers emailed us: Is Jackson correct that since the law passed, homicides of black victims have tripled? Data on black homicide victims in Florida Signed into law by then-Gov. Jeb Bush in 2005, Florida’s "stand your ground" law says a person has "no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony." The Florida Department of Law Enforcement emailed PolitiFact data showing the number of black homicide victims each year. Since "stand your ground" went into effect part way through 2005, we started the clock ticking in 2006. Here are the number of black homicide victims each year: 2006: 524 2007: 573 2008: 564 2009: 494 2010: 452 2011: 476 2012: 532 That shows the sheer number of black homicide victims between 2006 and 2012 barely changed: it rose from 524 to 532. (Even if we did include 2005 -- which wouldn’t be a fair analysis since the law went into effect part way through the year -- we would not find the number of homicides of black people tripled. The number rose from 428 in 2005 to 532 in 2012, or a 24 percent increase.) We also looked at the number of homicides of black people as a percentage of the total number of homicides and did not find they tripled. Justifiable homicides So where did Jackson get this idea that homicides of black people had tripled? We aren’t certain, since Jackson’s Rainbow PUSH Coalition did not respond to our questions. However, we suspect that he might have been referring to justifiable homicides by civilians. Reports of justifiable homicides tripled after "stand your ground" went into effect, the Tampa Bay Times reported in October 2010 based on FDLE data. (The Times and Miami Herald are partners in PolitiFact Florida.) Later in the CNN interview, Jackson seems to be referring to these numbers. After a question specifically about the "stand your ground," Jackson said, "There has been a triple increase in these shootings since this law has been in effect." If what he meant by "these shootings" were justifiable homicides, then Jackson was on track. But that’s different from the statement he made earlier. (Read more about the increase in justifiable homicides.) Our ruling During an interview on CNN about Florida’s "stand your ground" law Jackson said: "Homicides against blacks have tripled since this law has been in existence." The law was enacted part way through 2005. The number of homicides in which black people were the victims fluctuated from year to year between 2006 and 2012 and didn’t come anywhere close to tripling. It’s possible Jackson is confusing homicides with justifiable homicides, but that’s a key qualifier that he omitted in part of his comments. We’re rating his statement that homicides against blacks have tripled. That’s not accurate, so we rate the statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f87b2e8f-1ede-48fa-a331-d1dca3f923e7	None	Jesse Jackson	None	None	None	2013-07-24T16:42:41	2013-07-18	['None']
pomt-10140	"I have disagreed strongly with the Bush administration on this issue" of global warming.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/07/john-mccain/mccain-proud-to-have-parted-ways-with-bush/	During the second presidential debate, Sen. John McCain drew a distinction with President Bush on the issue of global warming. "We have an issue that we may hand our children and our grandchildren a damaged planet," McCain said when environmental issues arose during the Oct. 7, 2008, debate. "I have disagreed strongly with the Bush administration on this issue." He went on to say he traveled all over the world looking at the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, and introduced legislation on the subject of global warming. But let's check the record – as we have in the past when McCain made similar claims on the campaign trail – and see if he was in fact at odds with Bush on global warming. McCain spoke up about global warming in January 2003. And as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, he held hearings on the issue several years before that. On Jan. 9, 2003, McCain and Sen. Joe Liberman introduced the Lieberman-McCain Climate Stewardship Act, which sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by capping them and allowing companies and utilities to sell or trade their emission rights. When he introduced the bill, McCain called it "the first comprehensive piece of legislation" in capping emissions. "The U.S. is responsible for 25 percent of the worldwide greenhouse gas emissions," he said. "It is time for the U.S. government to do its part to address this global problem, and legislation on mandatory reductions is the form of leadership that is required to address this global problem." By contrast, the Bush administration has opposed cap-and-trade programs and preferred voluntary efforts on climate change. Manik Roy, director of congressional affairs for the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said McCain had actually been working on the climate change bill in 2001, but it got delayed after the 9/11 attacks. The Lieberman-McCain bill ultimately failed in October 2003 by a 43-55 vote, but Roy said it was a key step in "educating the Senate" about how government could respond to global warming. "It is absolutely correct that McCain stood up on this issue, forced the Senate to focus on this issue when nobody else thought it made sense and did it with strong opposition from the White House," Roy said. He called McCain "a huge leader on this issue in the Senate." And so we find McCain's statement to be True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-10-07T00:00:00	2008-10-07	['George_W._Bush']
pomt-14988	On the Keystone XL pipeline	no flip	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/14/hillary-clinton/clinton-says-her-keystone-xl-position-isnt-flip-fl/	Hillary Clinton says she now opposes the Keystone XL oil pipeline. Is that a flip-flop? Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley said yes during the first Democratic presidential debate on Oct. 13. "Secretary Clinton's campaign put out a lot of reversals on positions on Keystone and many other things," he said. Clinton said no. "You know, we know that if you are learning, you're going to change your position," Clinton said in response. "I never took a position on Keystone until I took a position on Keystone." We wanted to look at Clinton’s comments, which drew the ire of some critics. They pointed to something Clinton said in 2010. Then, she said the administration was "inclined" to approve the pipeline extension. But isolating that single word leaves out a good bit of context. The Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry heavy crude oil mixture from Western Canada to the United States, has long been on hold pending a review by President Barack Obama and the State Department. The administration must first determine if the pipeline "serves the national interest" because it crosses an international border. Chief opposition to the project comes from environmental groups. Throughout her campaign in 2015, Clinton has avoided taking a position on the pipeline -- until she announced in September that she opposes it. Prior to that, Clinton’s last substantial comment on her Keystone position was in 2010 when she was secretary of state. Speaking on Oct. 15, 2010, with the Commonwealth Club, a public forum in California, Clinton took a question asking if the administration would be willing to "reconsider" the pipeline. Here’s Clinton’s response: "Well, there hasn't been a final decision made. (Crosstalk) Probably not. And we -- but we haven't finished all of the analysis. So as I say, we've not yet signed off on it. But we are inclined to do so, and we are for several reasons -- going back to one of your original questions -- we're either going to be dependent on dirty oil from the Gulf or dirty oil from Canada. And until we can get our act together as a country and figure out that clean, renewable energy is in both our economic interests and the interests of our planet -- (applause) -- I mean, I don't think it will come as a surprise to anyone how deeply disappointed the president and I are about our inability to get the kind of legislation through the Senate that the United States was seeking." A couple of days later in 2010, a State Department spokesman said, "her words obviously stand," and "her response reflected the status of the Keystone XL pipeline." So yes, Clinton indicated that the administration at the time was "inclined" to sign off on the pipeline. But she did say multiple times that the analysis was not complete -- leaving open the possibility that the administration could backtrack if negative information were to come forward. The answer was positive toward the pipeline’s prospects, but she did not in any way say she supported it unequivocally. In a 2011 news conference with the Canadian foreign minister, Clinton answered a couple questions about the administration’s preliminary Keystone XL review. But she did not indicate her position beyond vague comments such as, "We are leaving no stone unturned in this process." Our conclusion Clinton said, "I never took a position on Keystone until I took a position on Keystone." In 2010, she said the administration was "inclined" to back it, but she qualified that statement by noting that the analysis was not complete, and the administration had not taken a final position. While this shows a more positive attitude toward Keystone XL than Clinton’s position today, it was not a firm stance. Other than that one comment, Clinton did not indicate her position on Keystone until she announced that she opposed it in September 2015. We rate Clinton's position a No Flip.

pomt-14367	"Requiring photo ID would keep about 200,000 Missourians from voting."	half-true	/missouri/statements/2016/mar/21/kip-kendrick/rep-kip-kendrick-half-right-voter-id-statement/	What documents should voters have to show to make it to the polls? The question continues to spark debate in state legislatures across the country, with new voter ID legislation coming to the forefront in a number of states. The Missouri legislature is discussing measures that would narrow the acceptable forms of voter ID to non-expired photo identification issued by the state or federal government. The proposed legislation would exclude currently acceptable forms of voter identification like student IDs, out-of-state driver’s licenses, or bank statements and utility bills. State Rep. Kip Kendrick, D-Columbia, recently weighed in on the legislation’s potential for disenfranchising voters, saying "requiring photo ID would keep about 200,000 Missourians from voting." That number caught our attention. We decided to dig into the details of the proposed legislation, and take a closer look at just how many Missouri voters would be affected by photo ID requirements. Numbers from the Secretary of State Kendrick said he got his estimate of those who would be kept from voting — "more than 200,000" — from Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander. A report from Kander’s office corroborates Kendrick’s statement, showing 220,000 people potentially disenfranchised. According to the Secretary of State’s office, that number came from comparing the list of registered voters in Missouri to the Department of Revenue’s accounting of those without driver’s licenses (about 150,000 people) and those with expired driver’s licenses (about 70,000). Those numbers are at best a rough approximation. Marvin Overby, political science professor at MU, said he can think of two factors that would make the Secretary of State’s estimate too high. "A number of people who don’t have driver’s licenses do have photo identification, it’s just in a non-driver’s license form," Overby said. "And those in prison or on parole or probation can’t vote, regardless of their ID status." Numbers from the proposed legislation An even higher estimate of Missourians without non-expired photo identification — almost 400,000 people — actually is cited in the proposed legislation’s fiscal note. The note sets aside up to $10.7 million to cover costs associated with providing new photo IDs. That’s because unless the House Budget and Senate Appropriations committees allocate the necessary funding to provide photo ID at no charge for those currently without, the state would be barred from implementing the new requirements. Kendrick’s source, Secretary of State Jason Kander’s report, doesn’t take this information into account. Kander’s report is two years old and refers to an older bill that did not require the state to bear the cost of providing supporting documentation necessary for photo ID — theoretically making the requirement of photo ID a poll tax. But the current proposed legislation does hold the state responsible for providing birth certificates or other necessary documents free of charge for photo ID. In theory, this would reduce the chances that any new ID requirements might disenfranchise voters currently lacking photo identification. The cost of photo ID The $10.7 million suggested in the proposed legislation’s fiscal note would cover other costs as well as providing supporting documentation for IDs, like manufacturing and postage for new photo IDs. It also includes funding for an updated DMV website; new hires in the Department of Revenue, the Department of Health and Senior Service, and the Bureau of Vital records; and pre-election TV, radio, and print ads to let voters know of the change in ID requirements. But it doesn’t mention any plans for in-person help for Missouri residents unfamiliar with navigating a bureaucracy — a lack of familiarity that could easily be a symptom of not needing to procure a photo ID in the past. And for some, even a photo ID supplied for no charge isn’t free. Missouri League of Women Voters President Elaine Blodgett said the costs associated with the new IDs go beyond creating a new document. "There’s an undue burden on women, who might have to get their birth certificates and marriage certificates and divorce certificates in order to get photo ID, if they’ve changed their names," she said. "Also, simply getting to all the offices needed can be nearly impossible for some of our disabled or elderly voters." Kendrick told Politifact Missouri that older adults may have issues tracking down birth certificates because states don’t necessarily have the same standards for maintaining birth records. He also added a time qualifier to his earlier statement and said "if voter photo ID was in place right now, over 200,000 registered MO voters would not be able to vote." In addition, even with the plan outlined in the bill’s fiscal note, some voters may still remain unaware of the new requirements. If voters came to the polls without the correct ID, they could cast provisional ballots; but in the 2012 presidential election, fewer than 3 in 10 provisional ballots were counted because many voters did not return to verify their address or identity after casting a provisional ballot. Our ruling While requiring a photo ID could be expensive and might affect or inconvenience between 220,000 and 400,000 Missourians, it wouldn’t necessarily keep them from voting. Unlike past bills, the legislation currently proposed does address the cost of supplying supporting documentation necessary for obtaining photo ID, making it difficult to say it would financially "keep people from voting." No one knows exactly how many Missourians would be affected by new photo ID requirements — but there is consensus that the number who would need new photo IDs is in the hundreds of thousands.

pomt-02546	Pinellas County voters "elected me as their chief financial officer … (and) elected me as (their) governor four years ago."	true	/florida/statements/2014/feb/05/alex-sink/alex-sink-says-pinellas-county-voted-her-be-cfo-go/	Democrat Alex Sink’s bid for the late C.W. Bill Young’s vacant U.S. House seat hasn’t exactly been helped by the fact that she isn’t a Pinellas native, though she did rent a condo and move there while launching her campaign. Republicans have harped on this point for months, calling Sink a "carpetbagger." They ask how could she well represent an area she didn’t grow up in. So it was no surprise that Sink addressed this concern at Monday night’s debate at St. Petersburg College. "One of the things that sets me apart is that I’ve actually been elected by the people of Pinellas County," she said, responding to a moderator’s question about how she differs from Jolly and Libertarian Lucas Overby, both of whom have never ran for elected office before. "They elected me as their chief financial officer and I served them and their interests. And they actually elected me as governor four years ago." PolitiFact Florida revisited 2006 and 2010 election results to see if Sink was right that a majority of Pinellas County voters supported her. Sink won her bid for chief financial officer in 2006, beating out Republican Tom Lee with 55.5 percent of the vote in Pinellas and 53.5 percent statewide. That’s different than what happened in 2010, when Sink lost a tight gubernatorial race to Republican Rick Scott. She netted 47.7 percent of the statewide vote, shy of Scott’s 48.9 percent. In Pinellas, though, the story was different. There, Sink came out on top, and by a bigger margin, with 50.7 percent to Scott’s 45 percent. We chose to focus on Pinellas County percentages because that’s what Sink referred to in her claim. But for the March 11 special election, not all Pinellas voters are eligible to weigh in. Florida’s 13th congressional district spans from Fort de Soto Park up to Dunedin, but excludes parts of downtown and southern St. Petersburg. Our ruling Sink claimed that Pinellas County voters supported her in both her 2006 run for chief financial officer and her 2010 bid for governor. On both counts, the election results support her point. We rated her claim True.	None	Alex Sink	None	None	None	2014-02-05T15:15:53	2014-02-03	['None']
pomt-11054	"Most (immigrants) do show up in court."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/26/wolf-blitzer/majority-undocumented-immigrants-show-court-data-s/	Defenders of President Donald Trump’s aggressive approach to illegal U.S.-Mexico border crossings say the country faces a binary choice: hold offenders in detention centers while their cases are adjudicated, or allow them to fall off immigration authorities’ radar. The argument hinges on the belief that undocumented border-crossers released from federal custody are more likely to skip court and abscond than show up for mandatory court hearings. This rationale led the Trump administration to hold border-crossers in detention facilities without the possibility of being released on bond, in a break with the previous administration’s so-called "catch-and-release" practice. The acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Thomas Homan pressed the "no show" argument on CNN’s Situation Room, before anchor Wolf Blitzer pushed back. "They'll say the right thing to get released from detention, then they won't show up in court," Homan said June 19. "But they're already in the United States. They're lost in society. They never get removed. So as long as we send the world this message — ‘Come and say the right thing, get released, never to show up in court’ — you're never going to fix this." Blitzer countered, "Most of them do show up in court. They don't necessarily disappear." Immigrants’ purported low court attendance rate has become a popular talking point, from Trump himself ("When we release the people, they never come back to the judge, anyway — they're gone"), to White House staff and law enforcement officials, to the administration’s conservative media allies. In absolute terms, more than 100,000 non-detained immigrants have been ordered to be deported in recent years because they failed to appear before an immigration judge. However, as a percentage, most undocumented immigrants do show up for court. Court attendance by all types of immigrants According to Justice Department data from the last five available years, around 60 to 75 percent of non-detained migrants have attended their immigration court proceedings. That’s determined by subtracting the percentage of judgments entered against migrants in their absence (known as an in absentia ruling) from total judgments entered. So Blitzer is right, in percentage terms: Most of them do show up in court. But it’s worth noting that in absolute terms, that’s nearly 140,000 non-detained immigrants who were ordered to be deported between 2012-16 because they were not present in the courtroom, according to Justice Department data. (Though some immigration advocates say that count is high.) "On the overall question of the importance immigration officials should attach to no-shows: the glass is either half full or half empty," said Peter Margulies, an immigration law and national security law professor at Roger Williams University School of Law. Despite a majority attending their hearings, he said, "that still yields a significant number of no-shows (and) noncitizens unaccounted for." Several experts emphasized that using monitoring devices and providing immigrants with legal counsel correlated with higher attendance. "I do think having appropriate legal representation for asylum claimants would help a lot," Margulies said. "Many may not know that they have good claims. Better legal advice would further improve the attendance rate." Court attendance by asylum-seekers As the CNN transcript shows, Homan and Blitzer were discussing asylees, so it’s worth distinguishing that group from other migrants. Asylum-seekers flee to the United States out of fear of persecution in their home country due to race, religion, nationality, or because their social or political activities have put a target on their back. One example is the case of an asylee identified in court documents only as M.G.U., who is suing the Trump administration in relation to its family separation policy. M.G.U. fled Guatemala with her three minor-age sons after her husband received death threats for his community organizing efforts there, according the lawsuit. M.G.U. and her sons appeared at the San Ysidro, Calif., port of entry in May to request asylum due to their fear of returning to Guatemala. As a technical matter, M.G.U. and her family’s case is considered an "affirmative" application for asylum because the applicants went to U.S. authorities to make the request. In contrast, undocumented migrants requesting asylum during a deportation proceeding make a "defensive" application. In either case, immigrants must be found to have a credible fear of persecution to be considered for asylum. As we’ve noted before, there’s been a nearly 1,700 percent increase in U.S. asylum claims over the last 10 years. What’s fueling the increase is growing instability, gang violence and worsening economic conditions in Central America’s "Northern Triangle" countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. "Initially, a lot of migration was single males from Mexico coming for work," said Joshua Breisblatt, a senior policy analyst at the American Immigration Council. "Now you’re seeing a shift to Central American families fleeing record levels of violence in the Northern Triangle." So what do the court attendance rates of asylees look like? While the data is scarce, they show higher rates, compared to when all migrants are tallied together. One source of data comes from an Obama-era program that released asylees from detention and matched them with case managers who encouraged compliance with court-ordered obligations. As of April, the Family Case Management Program, or FCMP, had 630 enrolled families. Before the Trump administration ended the program in June, participants had a 100 percent attendance record at court hearings. They also had a 99 percent rate of check-ins and appointments with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to a Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General report. "According to ICE, overall program compliance for all five regions is an average of 99 percent for ICE check-ins and appointments, as well as 100 percent attendance at court hearings," the report said. "Since the inception of FCMP, 23 out of 954 participants (2 percent) were reported as absconders." In 2015, the immigration advocacy group American Immigration Council published a report that looked at studies from over the previous two decades that examined how well asylum seekers fulfilled their legal obligations. It found studies showed "very high rates of compliance with proceedings by asylum seekers who were placed into alternatives to detention." The report cited a 2000 U.S. government-commissioned study that found an "83 percent rate of compliance with court proceedings among asylum seekers who were found to have a credible fear in the expedited removal process." It also showed an 84 percent compliance rate among asylees under minimal supervision, and 78 percent among those who were unsupervised. A 2013 study sponsored by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees that looked at asylees in Toronto and Geneva noted a "cooperative predisposition" among asylum seekers. While the study did not look specifically at U.S.-bound asylees, it cited characteristics common among asylees, including an "inclination towards law-abidingness," perhaps in relation to having fled home counties lacking in rule of law. It also noted asylum-seekers "lack of a plan B" due to the "impossibility of returning home." Our ruling Blitzer said "most (immigrants) do show up in court." Around 60-75 percent of non-detained migrants have attended their immigration court proceedings, according to Justice Department data from the last five available years. Some limited data suggests rates may be higher for asylum-seekers. That said, it’s important to note that in absolute terms, a significant number of migrants have had in absentia deportation orders filed against them for failure to appear in court, which Blitzer’s statement overlooks.

pomt-03624	Says Gov. Rick Scott allowed Republican legislators to cut his teacher pay raise proposal by 60 percent.	false	/florida/statements/2013/may/06/allison-tant/democratic-party-chair-allison-tant-attacks-gov-ri/	Florida Democratic Party chairwoman Allison Tant attacked Gov. Rick Scott as a feckless chief executive who let the Florida Legislature steamroll his session priorities. "He boasted that his No. 1 priority for the 2013 session was a $2,500 across-the-board raise for classroom teachers," Tant wrote in an April 30 column for Florida Voices. "Seven weeks later his abject failure to defend his top issue has allowed Republican legislators to cut that raise by 60 percent with a multitude of strings attached." We detailed the Legislature’s compromise with Scott on teacher pay raises in this fact-check. In this case, we were intrigued by Tant’s claim that legislators cut Scott’s requested pay raise by 60 percent. (Tant’s column ran a few days before the Legislature lifted some of the more controversial strings on the raises, including the requirement that they be paid no sooner than June 2014.) Before the session, Scott asked for a pot of $480 million from which to dole out a $2,500 raise to every teacher. The Legislature set aside the amount he wanted, on top of adding $1 billion to education spending. But lawmakers did not exactly follow his request. The raises will not go just to teachers. Principals, vice principals, guidance counselors, social workers, psychologists and librarians are also eligible for raises. Scott said every teacher will get a raise. While a raise is likely for most, it is not guaranteed. School districts in negotiations with unions will ultimately decide who gets raises and how much. Lawmakers outlined a merit-pay system but gave districts the choice to implement their own merit plans. Adding thousands of noninstructional personnel into the pool for raises is another point of consideration, as superintendents may have to shuffle the amount of raises for teachers or the number of people who get them to make everyone fit. Bottom line: The specifics are TBD, to be determined. We asked the Democrats to support the 60 percent figure. Did Tant crunch the numbers and find that teachers will get raises of just $1,000, or 60 percent less than what Scott wanted? The Democrats: The line was a mistake. Tant’s column conflated money for teacher pay raises with money that was set aside for raises for state workers. "It was an error," said party spokesman Max Steele. State and university workers will receive a $1,000 or $1,400 raise depending on income (some may earn an extra $600 for performance) for the first time in seven years starting in October. Law enforcement officers will get even higher raises. What the Democrats did is divide the $200 million pot for state and university workers by the $480 million Scott asked for. Using that (flawed) math, Scott got about 40 percent of his request -- or, viewed another way, a 60 percent cut of what he asked for. Our ruling Tant said Scott only got 60 percent of the teacher pay raise he wanted. The final budget compromise adds thousands of noninstructors into the pay raise mix, which could affect the number of teachers who get raises or at least how much those raises are. Still, we don’t know what that will mean on a statewide level because teacher pay is worked out by local districts and their unions. Still, this isn’t even what Tant was trying to analyze. She just used a mismatched number. We give the Democrats props for coming clean with their mistake. But we rate Tant’s statement False.

pomt-09182	"Sixty-four percent of Americans support the Arizona immigration law.''	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/03/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-says-president-obama-out-step-nation-ar/	With the stroke of a pen, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer catapulted herself into the national spotlight. On April 23, 2010, she signed into law what many call the toughest bill on illegal immigration in the country. The bill makes it a crime to stay in the country illegally, requires all aliens to carry immigration paperwork, and sanctions employers who knowingly hire illegal workers. Facing criticism that the law would legalize racial profiling, the Arizona Legislature modified the law on May 1, 2010. It now states that police officers cannot use race as the sole grounds for suspecting that someone is in the country illegally. The law produced mixed reactions among political leaders. President Barack Obama commented that it threatened ''to undermine basic notions of fairness that we cherish as Americans, as well as the trust between police and our communities that is so crucial to keeping us safe.'' But some people argue that President Obama's reaction is unfounded, given that the majority of Americans actually supports Arizona's immigration law. During his May 27 show, talk host Glenn Beck said that "Sixty-four percent of Americans support the Arizona immigration law. Yet we're going to -- we're actually -- our government is going down there to fight them. Eric Holder is fighting them in court. They're becoming more and more brazen each and every day." Beck is referring to an announcement by Attorney General Eric Holder that the U.S. Department of Justice may challenge the law in court. Given the public outrage over the law, is Beck correct that more than 6 in 10 Americans stand behind Arizona? We decided to find out. The number that Beck cites comes from a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll that was conducted in early May. The poll found that 64 percent of Americans were either somewhat or strongly supportive of the law. There are other polls, however, that show a slightly different result. • An April 27-28 Gallup poll found that of those Americans who have heard of the law, 51 percent support it. Among all Americans, 39 percent favor it, 30 percent oppose it, and 31 percent either had no opinion or have not heard of the law. • A Pew Research Center poll conducted between May 6 and May 9 found that 59 percent approve of the law. • A May 19-24 poll by the Quinnipiac University found 51 percent of American voters support the Arizona law. Moreover, 48 percent say that they want their state to pass an immigration law similar to Arizona's. All of the polls that we've looked at show that more Americans favor the law than oppose it, but the numbers vary widely. To recap. Glenn Beck said on his program that 64 percent of Americans support Arizona's new immigration law. That statistic, however, comes from a single poll. Other polls show slightly lower approval ratings. Still, his underlying point that most Americans agree with Arizona is correct. We rate this one Mostly True.	None	Glenn Beck	None	None	None	2010-06-03T13:22:07	2010-05-27	['United_States', 'Arizona']
pomt-12521	"The pace of missile development between (Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un) has increased the testing about twenty-fold."	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2017/apr/24/richard-burr/north-koreas-missile-testing-and-development-has-i/	Shortly after North Korea failed to launch a missile in an attempted show of force, one of the U.S. congressmen who keeps a particularly close eye on the erratic dictatorship had a warning. North Carolina Republican Sen. Richard Burr, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told a group of constituents at a meeting in Youngsville, N.C., that North Korea’s latest actions were "something to really be concerned about." Burr went on to explain two reasons for his warning. One, he said, is that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un might be crazy. The other, he said, is that Kim has significantly ramped up missile development and testing since taking over for his father, the late Kim Jong-il. "When you do things like he does, you automatically assume he’s crazy," Burr said of Kim Jong Un. "The pace of missile development between his father’s term and his term has increased the testing about twenty-fold." There has been plenty of bluster and confusion surrounding the country’s missile launch lately – including the launch itself, a pre-launch parade replete with new military technology, and the Trump administration saying it had sent an aircraft carrier strike force to the area when, in reality, the ships were thousands of miles away and sailing in the opposite direction. So in the midst of so much noise, we wanted to know if Burr was right. Specifically, we looked into his claim that "the pace of missile development between (Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un) has increased the testing about twenty-fold." A tiny but well-armed country In terms of troops, North Korea has one of the world’s largest militaries, along with the United States (a major adversary), China (its biggest ally) and India. Kim Jong Il wasn’t hesitant to build and test missiles, much to the dismay of neighboring countries. So increasing missile activity by a factor of 20 would require serious commitment by the younger Kim. Burr’s office didn’t respond when we asked where he got his information. He is, of course, privy to all sorts of secret reports and briefings we don’t have at our own disposal. He’s the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which oversees the 17 U.S. spy agencies. But we don’t think he would have unveiled classified information. And from the information that is public, it appears Burr is more or less correct. Missile testing and development We interviewed multiple North Korea experts, none of whom said they could verify the numerical accuracy of Burr’s claim – especially as it relates to missile development. Missile tests can be counted, but it’s harder to quantify the speed at which new technologies are being developed and perfected. "Perhaps saying the ‘pace of missile development’ is not quite accurate wording, but the pace of testing has indeed been unprecedented under Kim Jong Un," said Jean H. Lee. Lee is a former journalist who covered North Korea and now works for the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. She said even failed tests are worrisome because North Korea is trying to create a nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile that could hit the United States. "With every test, they get closer to mastering that technology," she said. We couldn’t find any report from the Department of Defense that might vouch for Burr’s numbers. But we did find a February speech by Admiral Harry Harris, the head of the DoD’s Pacific Command. He spoke about North Korea’s "aggressive weapons test schedule" and a growing missile threat in the Pacific, which is in keeping with the general theme of Burr’s claim. The North Korea experts we interviewed all said something like Lee’s assessment: That Burr is correct to say Kim Jong Un put a greater focus on missiles, even if it’s hard to define how much. "The range of their missiles is being extended," said T.J. Pempel, a University of California, Berkeley, political science professor who specializes in northeast Asia. "They have substantial submarine launched missiles; they have ICBMs. The frequency and number of their tests is also going up." Joseph Bermudez, an expert with the North Korea analysis group 38 North who has testified before Congress and the United Nations on the country’s missiles, said Burr is right about the increased pace of testing. One of Bermudez’s colleagues at 38 North put together a timeline of missile tests by North Korea, along with an assessment that nearly backs up Burr’s point – at least about testing, if not about development. It said North Korea tested only one missile in 2006 (under Kim Jong Il) but tested 15 in 2014 (under Kim Jong Un). In 2016, the DoD’s annual report to Congress made a similar point. "Kim Jong Un seems to prioritize the development of new weapons systems, as demonstrated by his numerous appearances with military units and research and development organizations," the report read. But Bermudez said Burr’s not necessarily right to say an increase in testing equates to breakthroughs in development. Every missile program requires research and development, testing, training, tweaking and more testing. It’s not a fluid timeline, Bermudez said. There are spikes in activity surrounded by relatively dormant periods. "Now if you have multiple missile programs going on, these cycles overlap," he said. "... It might give the false impression that something is happening that isn't happening." Furthermore, he said, many North Korean missile tests are conducted for political reasons, intended to send a message instead of to further research and development. That’s another factor making it difficult to tell if the pace of development has driven the increase in the pace of testing, as Burr had claimed. Our ruling Sen. Richard Burr said that in North Korea, "the pace of missile development between (Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un) has increased the testing about twenty-fold." Experts say missile testing has certainly increased, and at least one analysis shows that increase was close to what Burr said. What’s less clear is if the increased testing has gone hand-in-hand with increased development, or if the tests aren’t moving the country’s missile program forward as much as they might seem.

pomt-13034	Lady Gaga announced she would cover her face "until Trump gets fired from office."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2016/dec/01/blog-posting/lady-gaga-did-not-say-she-would-cover-her-face-unt/	A story about recording artist Lady Gaga announcing she would cover her face until President-elect Donald Trump is out of office appears to be masking the truth. A Nov. 25, 2016, post on TheRightists.com claimed that Gaga — née Stefani Germanotta — revealed her protest plan on a CBS Sunday Morning interview. The original post, with the headline "Lady Gaga Reveals Plan To Cover Her Face Again ‘Until Trump Gets Fired From Office And I Feel Free Once More,’" was temporarily missing after the interview aired, but has reappeared. The story also was posted practically verbatim on several other sites. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com After a brief synopsis of Gaga saying she lamented losing her privacy to the paparazzi as a pop singer, the post quoted her as saying she was opposed to a Trump presidency. "I might have to go back to hiding my face again until he gets kicked out of the White House," the story quoted her as saying. She allegedly told CBS correspondent Lee Cowan that she had moved past "wearing a mask" as she had done with elaborate costumes earlier in her career. She thought Trump was a real monster who would drive her back to the practice, whether it was with makeup or an actual mask. "I’m sorry to have to disappoint my fans, but I’m afraid I’m going to have to revert to wearing a mask whenever I’m out in public, and that includes performing during live shows and on television as well," the story quoted her as saying. "Until Donald Trump is fired from office and stops making everybody’s life miserable, and simultaneously, until things quiet down around me a bit to a point where I’m able to go out to lunch and not have my picture taken 10,000 times on the way to the diner, I’ll be going back to wearing a mask." While Gaga did appear in a CBS Sunday Morning segment on Nov. 27, the idea that she announced a new kind of poker face turned out to be a bald-faced lie. She said no such thing in the nine-minute interview. We also could find no mention of it on her profiles at Twitter, Facebook or Instagram, or her website. (Our inquiries to her Interscope Records label and CBS News went unanswered.) Gaga, a Hillary Clinton supporter, did make a number of moves after Election Day, protesting Trump’s victory in front of Trump Tower, signing a Change.org petition asking Republican electors to switch their votes to Clinton and recently admonishing Melania Trump’s "hypocrisy" for the future first lady’s plans for an anti-bullying campaign. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com Gaga also really discussed with Cowan how she felt trapped in a bad romance with her public persona, unable to freely express herself outside of her own home: "I’m very acutely aware that once I cross that property line, I’m not free anymore. As soon as I go out into the world, I belong, in a way, to everyone else. It’s legal to follow me. It’s legal to stalk me at the beach. I can’t call the police or ask them to leave. And I took a long, hard look at that property line, and I said, ‘Well, you know, if I can’t be free out there, I can be free in here.’" The Nov. 25 story on TheRightists.com used similar, but not identical, wording before launching into the alleged Trump tirade. It’s possible the site was able to lift the initial gist of the interview before it aired thanks to a Nov. 23 preview of the segment on CBSNews.com. The site bills itself as a "HYBRID site of news and satire," and that "part of our stories already happens, part, not yet." It also admits that "NOT all of our stories are true!" There was no indication which part of the Gaga story might be true and which part was not. Other sites that posted the story didn’t specify, either. That gives us a million reasons to find their claims unreliable. Our ruling Bloggers said Lady Gaga announced she would cover her face "until Trump gets fired from office." The original post, which has been taken down, was on a site that billed itself as a hybrid of news and satire, and referenced a real interview on CBS Sunday Morning. There was no indication of what was real and what was made up in the story, and it was copied by several other sites that also didn’t identify the fabricated portions. Although Gaga has spoken out against Trump, there’s no mention of him in the CBS interview — nor did she announce a plan to shield her face out of grief. Bloggers may have been looking to garner applause for this one, but Gaga’s supposed mask appears to be made out of whole cloth.

pomt-09718	"Forcing Americans off of their current health coverage and onto a government-run plan isn't the answer, but that's exactly what the Democrats' plan would do."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/28/john-boehner/health-care-reform-will-not-force-people-governmen/	When Democratic Sen. Harry Reid announced this week that he was including a form of a public option in health care reform, Republicans didn't like it. "Whether you call it a public option, an opt-out, a trigger, or a co-op, the fact is all of these proposals put us on the path to government-run health care," said Republican House leader John Boehner. "Forcing Americans off of their current health coverage and onto a government-run plan isn't the answer, but that's exactly what the Democrats' plan would do." We've been studying the health care reform proposals in both the House and the Senate for some time now. All the plans have rules that would prevent people from being "forced" off their current health coverage and into a government-run plan. We asked Boehner's office for a response. Staffers sent us to a study by the Lewin Group , which predicts that 123 million people would be enrolled in a public plan three years after the exchange is opened. (The Lewin Group is respected by many health care analysts and operates with editorial independence, but it is a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, whose primary business is private health insurance.) Here's an outline of the general argument on how 123 million people could become enrolled in a public plan: The public option will be a health insurance plan backed by the U.S. government, so it will have access to unlimited taxpayer funds and have unsurpassed bargaining power with hospitals and doctors. It will be able to force providers to accept low payments, such as what Medicare, the government-run health program for seniors, pays. So the public option will be the cheapest insurance option available on the exchange. Employers will see this and decide to sign up all their workers for the public option. The private insurance industry will wither and die. A single-payer system is upon us. The problem with this line of reasoning is that the Democratic proposals so far include rules specifically to stop this from happening. We'll take it point-by-point: • The public option is not to be supplemented with unlimited taxpayer funds. The House and Senate bills say the federal government can support its administrative expenses when it begins, but it will have to be self-sustaining with patient premiums. • It will not be able to force hospitals and doctors to accept Medicare rates. The details of how the public option will work are still being developed, but committees in the House and Senate have indicated the public option should have to negotiate rates with providers, not pay Medicare rates. • Most employers will not have access to the health care exchange. The Senate Finance Committee proposal is very clear on this point; only small businesses will have access to the exchange. The House proposal is a little less clear. In the third year, it gives a health commissioner the power to allow businesses into the exchange. But the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office seemed to think the exchange would continue to be restricted to smaller businesses. The CBO projected only 30 million people would be in the exchange by 2019, a number too small to imply that all employers would be given access. • Employers can't sign up their employees for a health care plan. The House and Senate proposals specifically forbid that. The employer can provide a set amount of money as a benefit, but the employee decides which plan to buy. If an employee is willing to pay more for a more generous plan, the employer can't stop him. And employers definitely can't force employees to enroll in the public option against their will. An argument others have made along these same lines: If a public option is offered on the exchange, employers will dump their coverage and send them into the exchange to buy their own insurance. This is a largely speculative argument, however. Employers are under significant competitive pressure to offer health plans to recruit and retain workers, according to experts we've spoken with. Surveys show that workers see health insurance as the top benefit affecting their decisions on where they work. If there's evidence to indicate that the availability of a public option would overcome that dynamic, we haven't found it. There's another argument specific to seniors that Boehner's staff pointed to as evidence for his statement. They said that under the Democratic plans, seniors in Medicare Advantage would have to switch to regular Medicare. We've looked at this argument before: Medicare Advantage is a government program that pays private insurance companies a set rate to treat Medicare beneficiaries. It was conceived as a cost-containment measure on the theory that competition among private plans would drive down costs. That has not happened. The health care proposals would stop the extra payments that Medicare Advantage receives. (About 23 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in Medicare Advantage.) So it is conceivable that some people in Medicare Advantage will lose some of their current benefits , and they might have to enroll in regular Medicare. But does this really fit the criteria of "forcing Americans off of their current health coverage and onto a government-run plan"? While private companies are contractors in the Medicare Advantage program — so it does have more of a free market element to it — at the end of the day, Medicare and Medicare Advantage are both government-run plans, where the government decides how much it will pay for a basic package of benefits. In refuting this argument, we are not trying to imply that no one will ever have to switch plans if health care reform passes. Indeed, we looked at President Obama's statement, "If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan ," and rated it Half True, because health care reform will change many aspects of health care regulation, and it seems likely that will prompt insurers, employers and consumers to re-evaluate their health care plans and make changes. Obama later made a more accurate statement, that if you "already have health insurance through your job, or Medicare, or Medicaid, or the VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have ." We rated that True. But we've also found nothing in the proposals so far that would force people off their current coverage into a government-run plan, if they prefer and can pay for private coverage. Boehner said that was "exactly what the Democrats' plan would do." So we rate Boehner's statement False.

pomt-14434	Donald Trump has "described Hillary Clinton as one of the best secretaries of state in history."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2016/mar/08/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-best-secreta/	Just before Ted Cruz won the Republican presidential primaries in Texas and Oklahoma plus the GOP caucuses in Alaska, the Texas senator hammered Donald Trump as ill-equipped to face Democrat Hillary Clinton on the November 2016 ballot. On the Feb. 28, 2016, edition of CNN’s State of the Union, Cruz confirmed he personally will support whoever lands his party’s presidential nomination, "period, the end." "But I will tell you this," Cruz said to host Jake Tapper. "Listen, I think, if we nominate Donald, Hillary probably beats him. Not only does she get to attack him on a whole host of issues where he agrees with her, but… he's described Hillary Clinton as... one of the best secretaries of state in history." Cruz leveled a similar claim during the Feb. 25, 2016, Republican presidential debate in Houston, saying: "And on substance, how do we nominate a candidate who has said Hillary Clinton was the best secretary of state of modern times…?" We wondered. Did Trump truly rate Clinton’s performance as secretary of state among the best ever? In response to our request for backup, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier emailed us a link to a Jan. 17, 2016, web post by The Daily Caller, a conservative news site, presenting video of Trump saying on camera: "And how did she do as secretary of state? Probably above and beyond everybody else and everything else." A portion of the same video earlier appeared in a January 2016 Cruz campaign video suggesting tight ties between Trump and Clinton. Web searches led us to the Trump clip, posted by someone on LiveLeak.com, a British video-sharing site, Dec. 8, 2015. Asked where the video originated, the same individual (with the screen name Exec) pointed us to video from an NBC News interview of Trump after the builder-developer gave an Iowa talk on politics in August 2013. NBC News headlined the interview by reporter Kasie Hunt: "Trump: Clinton will have to defend record as secretary of state." Our transcript of Trump talking to Hunt on Aug. 10 or 11, 2013, about Hillary Clinton and President Bill Clinton: "Well first of all, I know her very well and I know her husband very well and I like them both. And they are, uh, you know, just really terrific people. I like them both very much. "But I think you’ll be, you know, you’ll be looking at the record of Hillary Clinton. And how did she do as secretary of state? Probably above and beyond everybody else and everything else. You’ll be looking at her record and everybody else is, will be looking at her record. "I don’t know that Benghazi, it doesn’t seem to have resonated like perhaps it should have. But many other things have come up and the world is in turmoil. And I think that a lot of people will be looking at Hillary’s record as secretary of state and she will be defending that record. And I’m sure she’ll do a good job of defending it. But that will be the thing they will be going for." No doubt, Trump said: "And how did she do as secretary of state? Probably above and beyond everybody else and everything else." That’s not explicitly best-in-history, but could be bandied in that way. Then again, it occurred to us, that comment could be taken as having a different scope; that is, Trump saying only that anyone appraising Clinton would focus on her record as secretary of state. (We encourage you to watch for yourself.) Consider this change of punctuation: "And how did she do as secretary of state, probably above and beyond everybody else and everything else." Note too that Trump said next: "You’ll be looking at her record and everybody else is, will be looking at her record," a point he made several times in the interview. Trump praised Clinton in 2012-13 Web searches led us to other instances of Trump making positive comments about Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state, which ran from the start of Barack Obama’s presidency in 2009 through January 2013. From a Trump-Greta Van Susteren exchange on the March 28, 2012 episode of "On the Record," a Fox News program: VAN SUSTEREN: "Looking at the administration, how do you think the vice president has done? (Joe) Biden, although, being a vice-president is not a job that is very visible, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, I'm curious what you think about those two." TRUMP: "I think Biden has been a very loyal person, to be honest with you. I think he has been a good vice president for the agenda that they set and he has been a very, very loyal person. I respect him for that. "Hillary Clinton I think is a terrific woman. I am biased because I have known her for years. I live in New York. She lives in New York. I really like her and her husband both a lot. I think she really works hard. And I think, again, she's given an agenda, it is not all of her, but I think she really works hard and I think she does a good job. I like her." VAN SUSTEREN: "She says she's out at the end of this term. Do you think we will see her again running for office?" TRUMP: "I think so. Assuming she is healthy, I think she probably runs after the next four years, I would imagine." VAN SUSTEREN: "Do you support her?" TRUMP: "I don't want to get into this because I will get myself into trouble --" VAN SUSTEREN: "That's why I asked you." TRUMP: "I just like her. I like her husband. Her husband made a speech on Monday and was very well received. He is -- he is a really good guy, and she's a really good person and woman." Also, a July 2012 MSNBC news story noted Trump’s statement in an October 2013 interview with Larry King about Hillary and Bill Clinton: "I like them both very much." (See Trump’s "like" about the 15:46 mark of the King interview posted here.) So, Trump in 2012 and 2013 indicated he personally liked Clinton and in 2012, when Clinton was still the secretary, Trump said she "works hard and I think she does a good job." Trump in 2015 But, unnoted by Cruz, Trump has most recently been critical of Clinton's work, calling her one of the country’s worst secretaries of state. On July 8, 2015, he sent a statement to the Business Insider calling Clinton "the worst secretary of state in the history of the United States." The publication said Trump issued his statement after Clinton told CNN she was disappointed in Trump’s campaign-opening remarks about Mexican immigrants. In his June 14, 2015, kickoff, Trump said: "When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people." Our ruling Cruz said Trump has "described Hillary Clinton as one of the best secretaries of state in history." To the contrary, Trump last year called Clinton the worst secretary of state in history and we didn't find any instance of Trump calling Clinton one of the best ever. Still, Trump previously said he liked Clinton and even that she was doing a good job as secretary -- while, in the 2013 NBC News interview, he said: "And how did she do as secretary of state, probably above and beyond everybody else and everything else." We see ambiguity in this phrasing, which could be taken as high praise or, more logically, as a clumsy rehash of Trump’s repeatedly expressed prediction in the interview that Clinton’s record would be a target of scrutiny. On balance, we rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-10422	Iran "might not be a superpower, but the threat the government of Iran poses is anything but 'tiny,'" as Obama says.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/21/john-mccain/mccain-twists-obamas-words/	In trying to portray Sen. Barack Obama as a neophyte when it comes to international relations, Sen. John McCain seized on some comparisons Obama made between the relative threat of Iran now vs. the Soviet Union during the Cold War. "Senator Obama claimed that the threat Iran poses to our security is 'tiny' compared to the threat once posed by the former Soviet Union," McCain said before the National Restaurant Association in Chicago on May 19, 2008. "Obviously, Iran isn't a superpower and doesn't possess the military power the Soviet Union had. But that does not mean that the threat posed by Iran is insignificant. "On the contrary, right now Iran provides some of the deadliest explosive devices used in Iraq to kill our soldiers. They are the chief sponsor of Shia extremists in Iraq, and terrorist organizations in the Middle East. ... Should Iran acquire nuclear weapons, that danger would become very dire, indeed. They might not be a superpower, but the threat the government of Iran poses is anything but 'tiny.' " The jab provides the backdrop for McCain's repeated criticism of Obama for saying that he would meet without preconditions with leaders of rogue nations, like Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Here's the full context of Obama's remarks in Pendelton, Ore., on May 18, 2008: "Strong countries and strong presidents talk to their adversaries," Obama said. "That's what Kennedy did with Khrushchev. That's what Reagan did with Gorbachev. That's what Nixon did with Mao. I mean, think about it. Iran, Cuba, Venezuela, these countries are tiny compared to the Soviet Union. They don't pose a serious threat to us the way the Soviet Union posed a threat to us. And yet we were willing to talk to the Soviet Union at the time when they were saying we're going to wipe you off the planet. And ultimately that direct engagement led to a series of measures that helped prevent nuclear war, and over time allowed the kind of opening that brought down the Berlin Wall. Now, that has to be the kind of approach that we take. "You know, Iran, they spend one-one hundredth of what we spend on the military. If Iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us, they wouldn't stand a chance. And we should use that position of strength that we have to be bold enough to go ahead and listen. That doesn't mean we agree with them on everything. We might not compromise on any issues, but at least we should find out other areas of potential common interest, and we can reduce some of the tensions that have caused us so many problems around the world." The first part of McCain's recap of Obama's quote puts the context accurately, that Obama noted the threat from Iran was tiny "compared to the threat once posed by the Soviet Union." But McCain veers off the rails when he takes the next step, claiming that Obama characterized the threat from Iran as tiny or insignificant. Obama never said that. Later in the same day, Obama issued a retort to McCain's comments: "So John McCain, he said, 'Oh, Obama doesn't understand the threat of Iran.' I understand the threat of Iran. But what I know is that the Soviet Union had the ability to destroy the world several times over, had satellites spanning the globe, had huge masses of conventional military power all directed at destroying us, and so I've made it clear for years that the threat from Iran is grave, but what I've said is that we should not just talk to our friends, we should be willing to engage our enemies as well, that's what diplomacy is all about. "So let me be absolutely clear: Iran is a grave threat. It has an illicit nuclear program, it supports terrorism across the region and militias in Iraq, it threatens Israel's existence, it denies the Holocaust. But this threat has grown, primarily – and this is the irony - the reason Iran is so much more powerful now than it was a few years ago is because of the Bush-McCain policy of fighting an endless war in Iraq and refusing to pursue direct diplomacy with Iran." This isn't the first time Obama has talked about the grave threat posed by Iran. Obama has repeatedly characterized it as such during his campaign. Still, Reginald Dale, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Obama's comparisons of the threats posed by Iran versus the Soviet Union during the Cold War are misguided. "Iran is a completely different threat," Dale said. During the Cold War, both sides had stockpiles of nuclear weapons. There was mutually assured destruction. "They could negotiate like people who are equals," Dale said. "Neither side wanted to fire first. Both sides knew, more or less, how the other would behave." That provided some stability, he said. Iran, on the other hand, presents an "asymmetrical" warfare problem, he said. "It's not one super power facing another super power," Dale said. Iran is attempting to develop nuclear weapons, Dale said, while unapologetically supporting terrorist groups like Hamas, who would have little hesitation about setting off a nuclear weapon in the United States. "You could definitely say it's more dangerous than the Cold War," he said. One could argue whether it's wise to meet with leaders of rogue nations. One could also debate whether Obama wrongly downplayed the threat posed by Iran. But Obama never said the threat from Iran was "tiny" or "insignificant," only that the threat was tiny in comparison to the threat once posed by the Soviet Union. In fact, Obama has repeatedly called Iran a grave threat. We rule McCain's statement False.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-05-21T00:00:00	2008-05-19	['Iran', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-06390	Says that "we brought CHI Manufacturing, that had business in China, back to" Texas.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/oct/31/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-we-brought-chi-manufacturing-had-b/	After former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney revisited his vow to challenge China for manipulating its currency to advantage in foreign trade, Rick Perry said at the Oct. 11, 2011, Bloomberg/Washington Post Republican debate that one policy or another isn’t vital to getting more Americans back to work. Talking up domestic energy resources, the Texas governor also said the country needs a president committed to "pulling the regulations back, freeing this country to go develop the energy industry that we have in this country. I can promise you that we do that and we'll create an environment in this country where the manufacturing will come back to this country. We did it in Texas. We brought CHI Manufacturing, that had business in China, back to the state of Texas." Among online politicos, Perry’s comment touched off Twitter mentions of Farouk Shami, a Houston hair-care mogul who sought the state’s 2010 Democratic gubernatorial nomination. In his campaign, Shami said in a TV ad that he had just brought 1,200 jobs to Texas "by moving his factories here from China." Half True, we said at the time. Shami’s campaign told us that the jobs were created at a new Houston facility, CHI USA, in July 2009 as a result of moving production from South Korea, not China. Shami’s endeavors appear to be operating under the umbrella of Houston-based Farouk Systems, Inc. Shami’s campaign said at the time that a miscommunication over where the jobs were cut led to incorrect information in the ad, which was changed after our inquiry to say that jobs were only moved from South Korea. Then-Shami spokesman Vince Leibowitz said that some jobs had been created as a result of relocating production from China, but not the ones advertised as part of Shami's campaign. Also at the time, Elizabeth Yong, public relations manager for Houston-based Farouk Systems Group, said CHI USA produces "five to 10" of the company's five dozen hair care tools, including the original flat iron. Yong said bringing all production stateside would take two years, though "more than 1,000" jobs had already been shifted. In July 2010, the company said it hopes to shift 4,000 jobs to Texas by 2012, starting with the move of 1,000 jobs from South Korea and China. For this review, Perry’s campaign referred us to his state office, which reminded us that Perry attended a July 30, 2009, ribbon-cutting in Houston when Farouk Systems announced its plans to shift 1,200 jobs from South Korea and China to Houston. As the Austin American-Statesman noted in a Sept. 4, 2009, news article, Perry that day called Shami someone "who pretty much embodies the American dream." According to a video posted on the governor’s website, Perry also said: "Inspired by the freedoms we enjoy, he was drawn to this state where people are still free to achieve. He's built a life of significance and an organization that is respected around the world. His is the story of Texas." Thanking Shami for his "bold move," Perry said: "We are celebrating a leader who is moving jobs from another country ... to Texas." A press release issued by the governor’s office that day starts by saying that at the plant, Perry "credited Texas’ predictable regulatory climate, low taxes and skilled workforce with attracting jobs and companies from around the world." Shami isn’t shown speaking in the video. He’s also not quoted in the press release. News accounts do not mention any state role in Shami's decision to move jobs from abroad to Houston, nor is he quoted crediting a state action for prompting him to shift jobs from abroad. So why did Perry attend? "It was a major jobs announcement in the state of Texas," Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed told us by email. "He was invited." In describing the job moves, Shami has been quoted citing automation at the Houston plant as critical and his desire to get away from counterfeiting of his products in China, among other factors. An Aug. 2, 2009, news article in the Houston Business Journal says Shami decided to move the manufacturing of the CHI and other Farouk Systems products from overseas to Houston for safety and economic reasons. "Our employees are more efficient, and our quality control is superior," Shami said of U.S. workers. "Plus, I’m seeing more people in other countries wanting the American lifestyle and American products. They want to buy products made in the U.S.A." The story further says that while conducting the manufacturing here opposed to overseas would be more expensive, Shami said other benefits would make up for the increased costs. "We won’t have to fly products in, we won’t have to pay duties and we won’t have as many defects," Shami told the publication. "We may be sacrificing some of the profit, but the increase in volume will make up for that loss in profit." An Aug. 6, 2010, USA Today news article quotes Shami as saying his company had spent $500,000 a month battling foreign counterfeiters who put the company's trademark on copies of its products. "Counterfeiting is killing us," Shami said. "To remedy the problem and whittle inventory costs to $50 million from $120 million," the story continues, the company "moved some assembly of its irons and dryers from South Korea and China to a Houston factory that employs 1,000. Manufacturing costs in China are still about 30 percent lower. But (Shami) believes the appliances' ‘Made in the USA’ stamp will increase sales to hair salons." In a recent telephone interview, Farouk Systems spokeswoman Amy Johnson told us the Houston plant has 1,200 jobs with 300 additional jobs to be added soon. Johnson also told us that some limited-edition hair irons are still made in China. In earlier years, she said, 40 percent of the company’s products were made here, 60 percent overseas. Now, she said, the split is 80 percent here, 20 percent overseas. "We’re definitely happy to be a positive example," she said. We asked Johnson for details about how many jobs have shifted from China to Texas and how either the Texas economy or actions by Texas state government encouraged those moves. She replied that Shami wanted to talk to us, but we did not hear from him. Ironing all this out, it seems likely the manufacturer of the CHI hair iron moved some jobs from China to Texas. However, there’s no indication that qualities specific to the Texas economy or actions by state government merit credit for the shift. It could be, too, that most of the moved jobs came from South Korea. In any event, CHI still has products made in China. Ultimately, Perry’s statement overreaches by indicating the company deserted China and by claiming that anyone besides Shami "brought" the jobs from abroad. We rate Perry’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-09848	Preventive care does not save the government money.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/17/david-brooks/brooks-claims-preventive-care-will-cost-government/	The logic behind preventive care seems simple enough: stopping illnesses before they happen will mean fewer pricey procedures at the hospital and lower health care costs for all. Not so, says columnist David Brooks, who was interviewed on the Aug. 14, 2009, edition of the NewsHour with Jim Lehrer . He said President Barack Obama claims that "preventive care saves money," but the reality is "that's not true. ... If you're testing people, say, for an illness, you have to give 100 people a test to get five people — to find five people. Now, preventive care is good for health. Everyone agrees on that. But if you look at the CBO studies and the other research, it doesn't save you money. We should do it. But because you have to test so many people to get the few you're really going to prevent serious illness from, you're really not adding up to a lot of cost saving." Brooks was talking about a core principle of Obama's health care overhaul: That many costly procedures and treatments can be prevented by catching disease earlier or preventing it all together. Operating under that logic, the House health care bill expands access to procedures such as hypertension screening and vaccines. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democratic Leader Steny Hoyer sang the praises of preventive care in an Aug. 10 USA Today op-ed. "Reform will also mean higher-quality care by promoting preventive care so health problems can be addressed before they become crises," they wrote. "This, too, will save money. We'll be a much healthier country if all patients can receive regular checkups and tests, such as mammograms and diabetes exams, without paying a dime out-of-pocket." Brooks's critique relied on new numbers from the Congressional Budget Office that indicate that preventive care isn't as cost-effective as Pelosi and Hoyer claim. "The evidence suggests that for most preventive services, expanded utilization leads to higher, not lower, medical spending overall," CBO director Douglas Elmendorf wrote in an Aug. 7 letter to Rep. Nathan Deal, the top Republican on a congressional subcommittee involved in the debate. Elmendorf explained that, while the cost of a simple test might be cheap for each individual, the cumulative cost of many tests could be quite expensive: "But when analyzing the effects of preventive care on total spending for health care, it is important to recognize that doctors do not know beforehand which patients are going to develop costly illnesses. To avert one case of acute illness, it is usually necessary to provide preventive care to many patients, most of whom would not have suffered that illness anyway. ... Preventive care can have the largest benefits relative to costs when it is targeted at people who are most likely to suffer from a particular medical problem; however, such targeting can be difficult because preventive services are generally provided to patients who have the potential to contract a given disease but have not yet shown symptoms of having it." In fact, a new government policy to encourage prevention could end up paying for services that people are already receiving, including breast and colon cancer screenings and vaccines, Elmendorf went on. The CBO did not put a price tag on the costs or savings associated with preventive care measures in the House bills because budgeting rules prevent them from doing so. But a few other studies back up the CBO's analysis, including a Feb. 14, 2008, article in the New England Journal of Medicine that was written in response to campaign promises for more preventive care. "Sweeping statements about the cost-saving potential of prevention ... are overreaching," according to the paper. "Studies have concluded that preventing illness can in some cases save money but in other cases can add to health care costs." And a study conducted by researchers from the American Diabetes Association, American Heart Association and the American Cancer Society concluded that, while interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease would prevent many strokes and deaths, "as they are currently delivered, most of the prevention activities will substantially increase costs." So, the consensus is that, while preventive care will almost certainly save lives, it's a stretch to say that it will save government spending on health care. As a result, we give Brooks a True.

pomt-10407	John McCain "has not led on nonproliferation issues when he had the chance in the Senate."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/02/barack-obama/present-for-votes-but-not-a-player/	Nuclear proliferation is one of those arcane-but-important issues that tends to get pushed into the shadows during presidential campaigns. But as Sen. John McCain tries to distance himself from Bush administration policies, he's using the topic to help make his case. In a May 27, 2008, speech in Denver, McCain endorsed seeking a new disarmament treaty with Russia and said he was open to re-evaluating the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty on underground nuclear tests that he voted against in 1999. Additionally, McCain called for eliminating the "bunker buster" that President Bush supports. Experts say the positions put McCain in a more centrist camp than Bush on the question of how to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons. They may also reflect a desire by McCain to steal some of his Democratic rival's thunder. Sen. Barack Obama has made nonproliferation something of a specialty during his 3 years in the Senate, partly by virtue of his seat on the Foreign Relations Committee. Responding to McCain's speech, Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton charged the veteran Arizona senator was playing catch-up, and asserted that Obama has been the more prominent player on nonproliferation during his brief tenure in the chamber. "By embracing many aspects of Barack Obama's nonproliferation agenda today, John McCain highlighted Obama's leadership on nuclear weapons throughout this campaign, and his bipartisan work with Richard Lugar in the Senate. No speech by John McCain can change the fact that he has not led on nonproliferation issues when he had the chance in the Senate," Burton said. He's got it right. Obama last year teamed with Nebraska Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel to write a nuclear nonproliferation bill that, among other things, called for disarmament talks with Russia and for ratifying a global ban on nuclear testing, and strengthened efforts to halt the transfer of weapons and fissile material. Portions of the bill dealing with terrorist threats were incorporated into a fiscal 2008 Foreign Operations spending bill enacted into law. Obama also collaborated with Sen. Richard G. Lugar, R-Ind., on enacting a 2007 law allowing the United States to export nuclear fuel, technology and reactors to India for peaceful purposes for the first time in three decades. President Bush praised it for increasing the transparency of India's civilian nuclear program. McCain certainly has been a key player on many thorny and controversial issues during his long Senate career, among them campaign finance reform, tobacco regulation and national security by virtue of his seat on the Senate Armed Services Committee. But a look at his record on nonproliferation shows he mostly showed up for key votes but didn't influence debates. During a 2004 debate on a fiscal 2005 defense authorization bill, McCain endorsed the continuation of the nuclear bunker buster by voting against a Democratic amendment that would have eliminated money for studying the weapon and for research efforts into low-yield nuclear weapons. The amendment was rejected 42-55. As he noted in the Denver speech, McCain in 1999 voted with a majority of Republicans against the Test Ban Treaty, a pact that garnered attention after nuclear tests in India and Pakistan increased tension between the countries. Conservatives at the time questioned how the ban would affect the long-term prospects of the U.S. nuclear arsenal, and thought then-President Bill Clinton's desire to set an example to the global community by ratifying the treaty was misguided. The pact – which the Senate rejected, 48-51 – also required the approval of the 44 nations with nuclear capability; at the time of vote, only 26 had approved it. In 1997, McCain was among 29 of 55 Republicans who joined with 45 Democrats to ratify the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention, which banned the development, production, sale, use or stockpiling of chemical weapons. And in 1992, he voted with the majority of the Senate in a 93-6 tally to ratify the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which provided for reduction of about one-third in the arsenals of long-range missiles and bombers of the United States and former Soviet Union. "The majority of people following the issue would point out McCain has not taken a leadership role on nonproliferation during his career in the Senate," said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Washington-based Arms Control Association. In spite of McCain's moves to the center, and his more fleshed-out positions on nonproliferation, we don't find much in McCain's Senate record to refute the charge of the Obama camp. We say, True.

pomt-12385	"You can collude all you want with a foreign government in an election. There's no such statute" (that makes collusion a crime).	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/may/31/gregg-jarrett/fox-news-hosts-wrong-no-law-forbids-russia-trump-c/	Fox News host Gregg Jarrett has a distinctive take on the investigation into possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign. Jarrett, a former defense attorney, said that even if the two worked together, it wasn’t illegal. "Collusion is not a crime, only an antitrust law," he said on May 30. "You can collude all you want with a foreign government in an election. There's no such statute." Jarrett made the same point in an article on the Fox News website. He wrote that special counsel Robert Mueller had been given the "futile" task of investigating a crime that doesn’t exist. "As special counsel, Mueller can engage in all manner of spectacular jurisprudential gymnastics," Jarrett wrote. "However, it will not change the fact that colluding with Russia is not, under America’s criminal codes, a crime." Really? We thought we’d look into the legal landscape. We wanted to know what election law does or doesn’t say; this is a separate question from what did or did not occur. By way of brief recap, the U.S. Justice Department appointed Mueller to investigate Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election. His first task was to explore "any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump." Jarrett said the only real trouble for the Trump campaign would be if it committed some other crime, such as helping the Russians hack into Democratic emails. He dismissed that as implausible and unsupported by any public evidence. We ran Jarrett’s argument by three election law professors, and they all said that while the word "collusion" might not appear in key statutes (they couldn’t say for sure that it was totally absent), working with the Russians could violate criminal laws. Nathaniel Persily at Stanford University Law School said one relevant statute is the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002. "A foreign national spending money to influence a federal election can be a crime," Persily said. "And if a U.S. citizen coordinates, conspires or assists in that spending, then it could be a crime." Persily pointed to a 2011 U.S. District Court ruling based on the 2002 law. The judges said that the law bans foreign nationals "from making expenditures to expressly advocate the election or defeat of a political candidate." Another election law specialist, John Coates at Harvard University Law School, said if Russians aimed to shape the outcome of the presidential election, that would meet the definition of an expenditure. "The related funds could also be viewed as an illegal contribution to any candidate who coordinates (colludes) with the foreign speaker," Coates said. To be sure, no one is saying that coordination took place. What’s in doubt is whether the word "collusion" is as pivotal as Jarrett makes it out to be. Coates said discussions between a campaign and a foreigner could violate the law against fraud. "Under that statute, it is a federal crime to conspire with anyone, including a foreign government, to ‘deprive another of the intangible right of honest services,’ " Coates said. "That would include fixing a fraudulent election, in my view, within the plain meaning of the statute." Josh Douglas at the University of Kentucky Law School offered two other possible relevant statutes. "Collusion in a federal election with a foreign entity could potentially fall under other crimes, such as against public corruption," Douglas said. "There's also a general anti-coercion federal election law." In sum, legal experts mentioned four criminal laws that might have been broken. The key is not whether those statutes use the word collusion, but whether the activities of the Russians and Trump associates went beyond permissible acts. Our ruling Jarrett said that "you can collude all you want with a foreign government in an election," because there’s no law that says collusion is a crime. Three prominent election law scholars said there are at least four laws that would prohibit the sort of activities under investigation, whether those laws mention collusion or not. Jarrett’s focus on a single word fails to reflect the reach of the criminal code. We rate this claim False.

pomt-13042	There was "serious voter fraud" in California.	pants on fire!	/california/statements/2016/nov/28/donald-trump/pants-fire-trumps-claim-about-california-voter-fra/	Grabbing the attention of the Golden State, President-Elect Donald Trump claimed in a recent tweet there was "serious voter fraud" in three states won by Hillary Clinton during the General Election, including California. Here’s his tweet: Trump made this claim on Sunday during a flood of tweets about voter fraud. The president-elect also said he would have won the popular vote if not for "the millions of people who voted illegally." PolitiFact national examined that claim and rated it Pants on Fire. We decided to fact-check Trump’s eye-opening claim about "serious voter fraud" in California. Our research Trump offered no evidence about California voter fraud in his series of tweets. On Monday, Trump spokesman Jason Miller cited a national study done by the Pew Research Center showing that approximately 24 million voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or inaccurate. However, no one from Trump’s office has shown evidence of "serious voter fraud" in California. Trump may be drawing on an unsupported claim that 3 million "illegal aliens" cast votes in this year’s election. That allegation was made on Twitter by Gregg Phillips, who has worked for the Republican Party and has a voter fraud reporting app. PolitiFact reported that Phillips has not released any corroborating evidence and noted that public information undermines his statement. It rated his claim False. On Nov. 8 in California, there were reports of election glitches, such as the wrong names being placed on some absentee ballots and long lines at some polling places. But state and local election officials, along with independent observers, say there have been no reports of widespread voter fraud in the state. "His allegations are completely unfounded," California Secretary of State Alex Padilla said in an interview. "I think it’s a big disservice to our country and to our democracy to continue to raise these doubts. If anything, a message back to Mr. Trump is, if you have proof, if you have evidence, please bring it forward. Procedures are in place to investigate any real voter fraud. But as the evidence has shown, the cases of voter fraud across the country are statistically minimal if you go back decades." Padilla’s office could not immediately say how many voter fraud complaints it’s received for this and past general elections. Hillary Clinton held a 3.9 million vote lead over Trump as of Nov. 28, a margin that’s grown substantially as California continues to count the state’s many absentee ballots. 'Broad brush allegations' Dean Logan, president of the California Association of Clerks and Election Officials and the top elections official in Los Angeles County, said in a statement responding to Trump’s tweets, that the state has "a history of accurate and accountable elections." Logan described Trump’s voter fraud claims as "broad brush allegations." Logan added in an email to PolitiFact California that: "Quantifying complaints or allegations of voter fraud is not a specific data set that we track. That alone probably gives you a sense of the frequency, but there is no indication that the rate of concern on this issue was higher in this election cycle than in any other." He added that there are legal avenues for challenging a voter’s eligibility. But none were used before or after the election, he said. "And I think that sort of goes to the point that there’s nothing to back up those allegations," Logan said. Sacramento County’s Assistant Registrar of Voters Alice Jarboe said of the more than 530,000 county voters that turned out on Election Day, none has made a complaint about voter fraud. Jarboe, who’s worked at the department for 18 years, said no complaints are "the norm" for elections in her county. "I’ve never seen anything (related to voter fraud) that would affect the outcome of an election -- ever," she added. Kim Alexander, president of the California Voter Foundation, a nonprofit voter advocacy group, said she’s not seen evidence of serious voter fraud. "No system is perfect -- people do make mistakes," Alexander said. She added, however, that California’s voter verification laws are among the most robust in the country. Each county, she noted, is automatically required to perform a recount a fraction of its ballots by hand. The state also prohibits paperless electronic voting, a type of voting that makes audits nearly impossible, she said. Trump’s unsupported claim about voter fraud in California may also draw on misinformation about two recent state laws: AB 60, which allows undocumented immigrants to obtain state driver’s licenses; and the New Motor Voter Act, which by mid-2017 will automatically register citizens to vote when they obtain or renew a driver’s license. The automatic registration only applies to citizens who are already eligible to vote, not to undocumented immigrants. Padilla, California’s secretary of state, has said the new system would require potential voters to show identification such as a birth certificate or passport to reflect their citizenship before they are registered. California voters, in most cases, are not required to show identification at their polling places. Our ruling Donald Trump claimed "serious voter fraud" took place on Election Day in California. He offered no evidence backing up his statement and his press team did not respond specifically to a request about fraud in the state. Elections officials and nonpartisan observers in California said there were no widespread reports of voter fraud. The state has some of the most stringent voter verification laws in the country. Allegations of fraud are so rare that Los Angeles County, the state’s largest county, does not track them. PolitiFact New Hampshire examined Trump’s claim that the Granite State also experienced "serious voter fraud." It described Trump’s statement as "reckless claim with zero evidence," and rated it Pants On Fire after finding there were "no complaints of voter fraud filed in an election in which more than 728,000 ballots were cast." Trump’s claim about California voter fraud is equally reckless and without substantiation. We rate it Pants on Fire. PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

pomt-13316	"Repeated requests for additional security in Benghazi were routinely denied" by Hillary "Clinton’s State Department."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/oct/07/paul-ryan/state-department-under-hillary-clinton-refused-sec/	The Sept. 11, 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, which killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans, have spurred numerous Republican allegations against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. GOP nominee Donald Trump went so far as to say the Benghazi victims were "left helpless to die" as Clinton, then the secretary of state, "soundly slept in her bed." That earned a False from PolitiFact National. Congressional investigations did not find Clinton was inattentive, much less asleep. Rather, she worked into the night after the attacks occurred. Several days after that fact check was published, the sister of Christopher Stephens, the slain ambassador, said she did not blame Clinton. But Patricia Smith, the mother of one of the other victims, has blamed Clinton. And Clinton, in part because of her "What difference does it make?" remark on the attacks, continues to be a target. House Speaker Paul Ryan tweeted this on Sept. 26, 2016, a couple of weeks after the fourth anniversary of the attacks: "Repeated requests for additional security in #Benghazi were routinely denied by Secretary Clinton's State Dept." In contrast to Trump, the Wisconsin Republican didn’t go quite as personal -- referring to Clinton’s State Department, rather than Clinton herself. That helps his claim. Prior fact check In May 2014, ahead of one of the congressional investigations into the Benghazi attacks, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., claimed the State Department "not only failed to honor repeated requests for additional security, but instead actually reduced security in Libya." Our rating was True. As we noted in that article: "There are disagreements about whether State acted reasonably, but that it didn't honor requests for additional security is established fact," said Georgetown University adjunct assistant professor Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, who is also a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which focuses on foreign policy and national security. The State Department has acknowledged it rejected requests to provide more security personnel in Libya. It also acknowledged rejecting a request to erect guard towers at the Benghazi mission, but notes that a number of physical security upgrades, such as the installation of concrete barriers to block unused gates, were made during 2012. The State Department’s own Accountability Review Board concluded that the number of diplomatic security staff in Benghazi in the months leading up to the attacks was inadequate "despite repeated requests" from the Benghazi mission and the embassy in Tripoli for additional staffing. In addition, PolitiFact National has reported that the numerous requests from officials on the ground in Libya for better security for the Benghazi compound are undeniable and well-documented. It’s worth noting, though, that our colleagues have also pointed out there is no evidence that Clinton herself was aware of the requests, or that she willfully denied them. Our rating Ryan said: "Repeated requests for additional security in Benghazi were routinely denied" by Hillary "Clinton's State Department." Ryan’s claim avoids trouble by focusing on the State Department, then led by Clinton, rather than on Clinton herself. It’s well documented that the department didn’t honor requests for more security prior to the 2012 attacks that killed four Americans. We rate Ryan’s statement True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2bba7888-3630-46d1-ae74-ca5bc3ef249c	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2016-10-07T05:00:00	2016-09-26	['United_States_Department_of_State', 'Hillary_Rodham_Clinton', 'Bill_Clinton', 'Benghazi']

Gates and his wife, Melinda, have invested billions of dollars to research, develop and deliver vaccines around the world to help reduce child mortality. "Bill Gates’ former doctor says billionaire ‘refused to vaccinate his children,’" said the headline on a Feb. 7 post on yournewswire.com. Yournewswire.com’s story does not identify the purported doctor and says the information was divulged privately at a "medical symposium in Seattle," without naming the symposium or a date. The story claimed "the comments caused a stir among physicians at the symposium with claims he was breaking doctor-patient confidentiality, according to reports. However as he was speaking to other physicians, he was not breaking the industry code of conduct." Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. (Check out all yournewswire.com’s posts debunked by PunditFact.) Yournewswire.com’s post includes information from a December 2015 CNN report about unvaccinated children in California. But it offers no evidence to support the claim about Gates’ children and their vaccination records. In their 2018 annual letter, the Gateses said they’ve "spent $15.3 billion on vaccines over the past 18 years. And it’s been a terrific investment." (The Gates children are 15, 18 and 22 years old.) Melinda Gates in a Feb. 22 Instagram post wrote: "When my first child, Jenn, was born, over 800,000 children were dying each year of rotavirus — a preventable, curable disease. It broke my heart to imagine watching your child get sick and knowing that medicine could save her — if only you had access to it. That was a clarifying moment for me.

pomt-12836	"ISIS is already using the rhetoric from the Trump administration, the text of this executive order, to incite attacks against us and to recruit more terrorists to their side."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/07/seth-moulton/mostly-false-claim-isis-already-using-trumps-execu/	A Democratic congressman called out President Donald Trump’s travel ban from seven majority-Muslim countries as counterproductive in the fight against terrorism. ISIS has already used the executive order in its recruitment propaganda, said Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass. In a Jan. 31 CNN interview, Moulton disagreed with Trump’s misleading comparison of his executive order to actions taken by President Barack Obama’s administration on Iraqi refugees in 2011. "Improvements to the vetting process are something that you'll find bipartisan support for here in Congress. What Trump has done in contrast is just put this blanket ban that will be used against us and our troops," said Moulton, who served four tours of duty in Iraq as a Marine Corps infantry officer. "In fact, ISIS is already using the rhetoric from the Trump administration, the text of this executive order, to incite attacks against us and to recruit more terrorists to their side." We previously confirmed that Trump was featured in terrorist propaganda videos for comments during the presidential campaign. But is the text of his executive order now being circulated to incite attacks against the United States and for terrorist recruitment? Experts said there have not been official releases from major terrorist groups, though their supporters are talking about it on social media. Trump’s executive order About a week into his presidency, Trump signed an executive order banning immigrants and nonimmigrants from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen from entering the United States for 90 days. The order also banned refugees for 120 days, and Syrian refugees indefinitely. The order was quickly challenged in courts and as of early Feb. 7, there was a temporary restraining order on Trump’s mandate ruled by a federal judge in Washington. The issue is now before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. We had not seen reports of ISIS using the ban for recruitment during that week, so we asked Moulton’s office for support for his claim. They directed us to a Jan. 29 Washington Post article headlined, "Jihadist groups hail Trump’s travel ban as a victory." A comment on a pro-Islamic State channel on a social media platform, Telegram, compared Trump’s executive order to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, "which Islamic militant leaders at the time hailed as a ‘blessed invasion’ that ignited anti-Western fervor across the Islamic world," the Washington Post reported. Other comments described Trump's order as one that would convince American Muslims to align with extremists, the article said. It also includes comments by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, on the Jan. 29 edition of CBS’ Face the Nation: "The effect will probably in some areas give ISIS some more propaganda." McCain and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R.-S.C., released a similar, forward-looking statement that said: "Ultimately, we fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism ... Our most important allies in the fight against ISIL are the vast majority of Muslims who reject its apocalyptic ideology of hatred. This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country. That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security." Moulton’s team referred us to tweets by Rita Katz, director of SITE Intelligence Group, a group monitoring jihadist websites. Katz’s tweets posted Feb. 3, a few days after Moulton’s comment, said: "First official #AQ response to #Trump presidency calls him"foolish" says "the flame of Jihad has been ignited & reached the East & West" "2) #AQ on #Trump's vow to "eradicate radical Islamic terrorism": "not directed only to the mujahideen...but also to the Muslims in general" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Katz told PolitiFact her Feb. 3 tweets were about a statement by al-Qaida, not ISIS, and that the statement she was referring to only mentioned a botched Yemen raid and Trump’s vow to "eradicate radical Islamic terrorism," not the ban specifically. "At the official level, there have been no direct mentions of the travel ban by ISIS, al-Qaida, or any other major jihadi terrorist organization," Katz said. "Even the sixth issue of ISIS’ monthly Rumiyah magazine, which was released this past Saturday, did not mention it." Katz said silence from such groups is "absolutely noteworthy, and goes against the conventional jihadi propaganda practice to exploit any event—especially high-profile ones like that of the travel ban—by which Muslims are affected." Terrorist groups' supporters, mainly al-Qaida supporters, have discussed the travel ban citing deceased al-Qaida recruiter Anwar al-Awlaki’s statement that the United States will "turn against its Muslim citizens," Katz said. She tweeted about that Jan. 29. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com Pro-ISIS social media channels are largely posting links to articles with very little commentary, Katz added. Moulton’s office also linked us to a tweet from @theosint, identified on its Twitter bio as a contributor to open source and social media investigation group Bellingcat. The tweet, posted Jan. 28, reads: "ISIS doesn't even share its own propaganda anymore. It just shares CNN and NYTimes articles about the @POTUS muslim ban on Telegram." See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Rukmini Callimachi, a New York Times correspondent who reports on ISIS and al-Qaida, asked @theosint to name what channel was sharing New York Times stories, because she had not seeing that happen. @theosint replied to her clarifying that the New York Times article wasn't specifically about the ban. On Jan. 30 Reuters reported that an Islamic State supporter in response to Trump’s order posted on Telegram: "Your decision will do nothing. Attacks will come at you from inside America, from Americans born in America with American parents and grandparents." Several channels on Telegram and on which Islamist militants posted about Trump’s order have been taken down, Reuters noted. Still, some experts are cautious about reading sympathizers’ support as official communication. Terrorist organizations are emboldened by statements or actions from elected officials, "but not always in as visible or simple a way as is often implied," said Charlie Winter, a senior research fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence, based in London. "I am in no doubt that Trump's executive order will make the lives of ISIS and its like-minded rivals easier, but I would be wary of drawing too linear a link. So far at least, ISIS has made no official pronouncement on the policy, nor has (al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula)," Winter said via email Feb. 6. "That said, supporters of the former have expressed that Trump is something of a ‘useful idiot’ to their group and official propagandists for the latter have written extensively about why Trump bolsters the salafi-jihadist worldview." Terrorist groups like ISIS use Trump’s "anti-Islam rhetoric to say that the U.S. is waging war on Islam," said William C. Banks, director of the Institute for National Security and Counterterrorism at Syracuse University College of Law. However, Banks said he was not aware of specific incitements or attacks based on Trump’s executive order. A New York magazine profile story on Callimachi, the New York Times correspondent focused on ISIS and al-Qaida, also notes that ISIS still had not made an official statement, though militants applauded the order. The New York piece published online Feb. 5. J.M. Berger, a fellow at International Centre for Counter Terrorism at The Hague, said that while he hasn’t been tracking Islamic State activity daily since Trump’s inauguration, claims like Moulton’s "often get out ahead of the actuality." But he agrees with concerns that Trump’s order may endanger America. "There are several levels at which the travel ban makes things worse. It furthers the jihadist narrative that America is broadly at war with Islam. It also creates new tensions with countries we should be cooperating with," Berger said. Our ruling Moulton said, "ISIS is already using the rhetoric from the Trump administration, the text of this executive order, to incite attacks against us and to recruit more terrorists to their side." Experts we communicated with said they believe the order plays into terrorist groups’ message that the United States is at war with Islam. Terrorist groups' sympathizers have discussed the ban on social media channels. However, experts said that neither ISIS or other major groups had made official announcements on Trump’s policy.

pomt-03192	"We are about halfway" to the president’s goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions and "about half of that is because of the substitution of natural gas for coal in the power sector."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/30/ernest-moniz/energy-secretary-moniz-says-us-halfway-greenhouse-/	When President Barack Obama took office in 2009, he set a goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent by 2020 if all other major economies pledged to limit their emissions, too. Improvements would be tallied against how much of those gases the United States put into the atmosphere in 2005, the year the global climate change treaty known as the Kyoto Protocol was supposed to take effect. The White House would have liked it if Congress had passed a cap-and-trade bill that in theory would create strong market pressures to reduce the release of carbon into the air. That never happened, but two major changes gave the president a shot at making serious headway toward his target. Energy consumption cratered when the economy collapsed and, as you would expect, lower energy use means lower emissions. On the more positive side of the ledger, the surge in natural gas production also helped the country move toward Obama’s goal, although not without concern over environmental side effects. In a question-and-answer session on climate change at Columbia University on Aug. 26, 2013, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz highlighted the impact of natural gas on emissions. "In these last years, the natural gas revolution, shall we say, has been a major contributor to reducing carbon emissions," Moniz said. "The president has a goal, as I mentioned, of 17 percent by 2020. We are about halfway there, and about half of that is because of the substitution of natural gas for coal in the power sector, essentially driven by market forces." We pay attention to the president’s promises and track how well he delivers the goods on the Obameter. But we also thought it would be worth digging into Moniz’s claim. Department of Energy’s focus on carbon dioxide The Energy Department, predictably, looks at the way energy use contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, and in particular, it tracks the dominant greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide. The department’s Energy Information Administration recently published the numbers for 2012, and the details surprised many people. The update reported that energy-related carbon dioxide emissions in 2012 were the lowest since 1994. Compared to 2005, those emissions had fallen by 11.8 percent. That is much more than halfway toward the president’s goal of 17 percent. The update also said the biggest drop was due to the declining use of coal to produce electricity. "Low natural gas prices led to competition between natural gas — and coal-fired electric power generators," the authors wrote. "Lower natural gas prices resulted in reduced levels of coal generation, and increased natural gas generation." And to produce the same amount of energy, natural gas puts less carbon dioxide into the air than coal does. The most detailed data is only as recent as 2011, but the shift from coal to natural gas is clear. In terms of power generation, between 2005 and 2011, use of coal fell from 50 percent to 42 percent while the use of natural gas rose from 19 percent to 25 percent. This isn't bulletproof evidence of causation, but it strongly suggests that the switch from coal to natural gas has played a role in reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Greenhouse gases — more than carbon dioxide If the only molecule to worry about were carbon dioxide, Moniz would have been totally right, but many compounds contribute to climate change. Obama pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent, not just carbon dioxide. The Environmental Protection Agency’s latest report looks at all the relevant gases, some of which are thousands of times more potent in their climate change impact than carbon dioxide. The EPA’s tally also includes activities other than energy production that put gases into the atmosphere. The agency’s figures show that from 2005 to 2011, emissions fell by 7 percent. Measured against the goal of 17 percent, the country has more than halfway to go. It’s roughly at the 40 percent mark. It is possible that when the 2012 numbers are in, the rate of progress will have shot up. The Department of Energy reported a relatively dramatic decline in the release of carbon dioxide in 2012. The EPA’s next report is planned for April 2014. We should note that a separate report from Moniz’s agency gives cause for concern. The Energy Information Administration projects that energy-related carbon dioxide emissions will start to creep up in 2018. By 2020, analysts predict they will show only a 9 percent reduction from 2005 levels. Our ruling Moniz said the country is "about halfway" toward the president’s goal of a 17 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 2005 levels. In terms of carbon dioxide, Moniz is correct, but when looking at all greenhouse gases, data from the EPA suggests the country has a little more progress to make. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-09385	"Marco Rubio thinks that government shouldn't be in the health care business at all."	false	/florida/statements/2010/mar/26/kendrick-meek/meek-accuses-rubio-wanting-government-out-health-c/	The day before the U.S. House of Representatives approved the health care reform bill, Democratic U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek, who is running for the U.S. Senate, fired off this accusation about the Republican frontrunner: "Marco Rubio thinks that government shouldn't be in the health care business at all." Meek made that statement on his campaign Web site March 20, 2010 -- the day before the historic vote. Here is the full quote: Rubio's "ideas on health care could jeopardize Medicare and veterans' care, programs which cover more than 5 million Floridians. Marco Rubio thinks that government shouldn't be in the health care business at all. That means these programs could be shut down. Moreover, his obstruction of the current health care bill means we could lose our best chance ever to prevent insurance companies from denying coverage due to pre-existing conditions and to close the Medicare prescription drug coverage 'donut hole.' That's what he stands for. If he were in the Senate he would lead the charge to scrap health care reform. If elected, he has sworn to do everything he can to repeal it." Meek has leveled a sweeping claim that Rubio thinks government should get out of the health care business entirely -- in a state where millions of voters depend on government health care such as Medicare and veterans programs. We know that Rubio is against the Democratic-led health care reform plan that the House approved March 21, but is it fair to say he wants government out of health care entirely? Meek's e-mail cites two sources: an article "Scrap Obamacare Today" written by Rubio on March 15, in Human Events, a conservative publication, and a blog item in The Buzz, a St. Petersburg Times politics blog. Both quote Rubio criticizing the health care proposal. "The President’s health care proposal is a deeply flawed plan that should be scrapped entirely in favor of a truly bipartisan approach that pursues step-by-step reforms,'' Rubio wrote in Human Events March 15. Meek's campaign also cited a March 3 press release from Rubio in which he spoke against "government-run health care." "Unfortunately, my opponent [Charlie Crist] disagrees and has said he would not scrap this bill and process. It underscores why, fundamentally, this campaign is about trust. It’s about who Floridians can trust to go to Washington to unapologetically stand on principle against ideas like the stimulus, cap-and-trade and government-run health care," Rubio said in the press release. The Meek campaign's logic is that Rubio's use of "government-run health care" in that paragraph has a broader meaning that indicates he's not just against the Obama reform plan, he's against all government health programs. Meek's campaign also cited Rubio's vote in the Florida House of Representatives April 6, 2006, against a Democratic amendment to an appropriations bill that reduced contract services by $5 million and included funding for a dental program for veterans. The Meek campaign also cited three Rubio votes on the Cover Florida state health care initiative requiring coverage for prenatal care and prostate screening and mammograms. All three amendments, introduced by Democrat Dan Gelber, ultimately failed and Rubio voted against them. Rubio voted in favor of the overall bill. But we find those citations are flimsy evidence for a big, sweeping claim that could alarm Florida voters, particularly senior citizens. In our view it's clear that "government-run health care" was referring to the Obama plan and it doesn't prove that Rubio is against programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Rubio's campaign also provided us with some evidence that he does believe government has a role in health care: * Rubio wrote an op-ed in the Orlando Sentinel Dec. 3, 2009, about the proposed health care bill that indicated he was concerned about cuts in Medicare: "The bill also would expand a financially unsustainable Medicaid entitlement program that is already straining state budgets. And it would fundamentally hurt Medicare by taking away access to Medicare Advantage plans and installing a new government bureaucracy to oversee Medicare reimbursements." * In 2000, Rubio was part of a unanimous vote in favor of hearing screening for newborns and a unanimous vote related to expanding Kidcare, a health program for poor children. In 2004, Rubio voted in favor of changes to Kidcare. He also voted for changes to the Kidcare program in 2004 fought by Democrats because of changes to eligibility requirements. Our own search turned up a few other examples that showed that Rubio has supported certain health care programs or proposals. In a Feb. 19 interview on Morning Joe, Rubio said Medicare "needs to be reformed," but did not provide details. Rubio supported expanding Florida's controversial Medicaid reform, which was initiated by former Gov. Jeb Bush in an effort to allow private companies to compete to provide serves for the poor, with the hope that it would slow growth in costs. Rubio was quoted in a March 6, 2008, Miami Herald article about the rising costs of Medicaid and the need to save it: "Florida simply cannot afford to continue doing business like we are currently. In order to save the Medicaid system, continuing reform is vital. Expanding Medicaid Reform into Miami-Dade County is an important step in creating a system that can survive and is a step that we should enact this session." In addition, Rubio supported a budget in 2008 that included an estimated $15.7 billion for Medicaid from federal and state sources, according to Florida's Medicaid expenditure estimating conference. Here is a list that shows Medicaid expenditures over several sessions when Rubio was in the House. Someone who believed government "shouldn't be in the health care business at all" wouldn't be supporting Medicaid. Another piece of evidence: A budget list compiled by the governor's office shows Rubio supported money for Jackson Memorial Hospital, a public hospital. "The budget list also links Rubio to a $20 million special line item for Jackson Memorial Hospital in 2008. Months later, Rubio established a consulting firm with a former aide and scored an $8,000 monthly consulting contract with the hospital,'' the Miami Herald wrote in a March 10 article. The Meek campaign has failed to prove its claim. Rubio clearly has spoken against the federal health care bill, which he has repeatedly referred to as a "government takeover" of health care (a characterization we've repeatedly rated Pants on Fire). But Rubio's votes and his comments indicate he has supported government health programs such as Medicaid. Lambasting a health care reform bill isn't the same as declaring that "government shouldn't be in the health care business at all." We rate Meek's claim False.

pomt-14064	A three-cents-per-ounce soda tax in Philadelphia "would result in the loss of 2,000 family-sustaining Teamster Union jobs and countless other jobs in the beverage industry."	false	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/may/20/daniel-grace/teamsters-say-soda-tax-would-cost-thousands-jobs-d/	Most of organized labor -- nearly all -- is just fine with Jim Kenney’s proposed sugary drinks tax. But the Teamsters have a big problem with it. They’re arguing they’ll lose jobs. Opponents to the tax argue higher prices will lead to decreased sales that will eventually trickle down and cause the soda bottling and delivery industry in Philadelphia to collapse. In fact, the loudest voice against the tax (outside lobbyists for the nation’s largest beverage companies) come from the Teamsters. Literally: They organized a ring of 18-wheelers that circled City Hall, horns blaring, to protest the measure. The first-year mayor wants to tax sugary drinks at three cents per ounce -- an unprecedented tax in America -- and use the revenue to fund pre-K, community schools and the city’s ailing pension fund. In a statement, Teamsters Local 830 secretary Daniel Grace wrote that the implementation of a three-cents-per-ounce sugary drinks tax "would result in the loss of 2,000 family-sustaining Teamster Union jobs and countless other jobs in the beverage industry." But there are about 2,000 people working in the beverage industry in Philadelphia in total. So we decided to look a little deeper into this claim. The American Beverage Association has claimed a soda tax in Philadelphia would result in job loss, but didn’t offer an estimate to PolitiFact and referred us to a local firm handling communications for those opposed to the tax. That firm also didn’t have an estimate on job loss and referred us to Grace, the Teamsters head in Philadelphia who didn’t respond to requests for more information. Instead, his spokesman Frank Keel emailed: "The Kenney administration has no idea about the Teamsters’ various roles in the beverage industry and no right to question the very real job losses we'll suffer if this regressive three-cents-an-ounce sugary drinks tax is passed into law." He again reiterated that "we stand to lose as many as 2,000 regional jobs in the beverage industry." Keel didn’t clarify what was meant by "regional," other than to say "there are several Teamsters locals in the Philadelphia regional jurisdiction." The Kenney administration disputes the figures as a "doomsday scenario" and said any job loss suffered due to the implementation of a soda tax will be offset by jobs created by the programming the tax would fund. "If sugary drink prices go up, then consumers will choose tax-exempt beverages like bottled water and diet drinks instead," Kenney’s spokeswoman Lauren Hitt said. "Small businesses will avoid job loss and maintain their profit margins by selling more tax-exempt drinks; and, accordingly, truck drivers will also be fine because they’ll be delivering more bottled water and diet soda." Without their clarification, it’s hard to discern how the Teamsters arrived at their job loss estimate. But economists and studies suggest it’s an overshoot. Robert P. Inman, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton school, called the estimate of 2,000 job losses "off the bounds of realistic." About 2,000 jobs would represent nearly the entire soda bottling and delivering industry in Philadelphia, and Inman said it’s inaccurate to assume that a three-cents-per-ounce tax on soda would cause the entire industry to crumble. He said his studies show the city could see a reduction in sales in the $150 million to $200 million range. But Inman said people won’t stop buying bottled drinks. They’ll either switch to bottled beverages like water that’s also bottled and delivered by large beverage companies, or they’ll switch to smaller sized bottles that also still need to be bottled and delivered in the city. "Wherever they’re getting the number from," he said, "it is so far above anything that strikes me as plausible." The Teamsters say they don’t buy the idea that the sale of water, diet sodas and the like will increase enough to cover the loss suffered as a result of the soda tax. In Grace’s statement, he wrote: "Consumers simply don't react that way." A 2014 study published in the American Journal of Public Health found a 20 percent tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (which correlates with about a two-cents-per-ounce tax) would result in small job gains. The study isn’t neutral -- it was funded by The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s Healthy Eating Research program. But it found that jobs lost as a result of the tax were offset by jobs created due to consumers switching to untaxed drinks like bottled water. A study published this year by Mexico’s Center for Health Systems Research found that after the country instituted a soda tax, there was a bump: Overall sales increased, largely due to higher amounts of bottled water being purchased. But then, after a year, sales fell to where they were before the tax was passed. The estimate is also higher than any other made before. When city officials floated a soda tax in 2011, the soda companies themselves predicted a job loss of 1,200 people. Al Taubenberger, a current city councilman and the former head of the Greater Northeast Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce, said at the time it would cost the city 1,000 jobs. After Baltimore instituted a two-cents tax on beverage containers last year, about 75 people lost their jobs. But Inman said any job loss estimate when it comes to a soda tax is dubious. Without statistical data -- as no other place in America has instituted a three-cents-per-ounce soda tax -- it’s nearly impossible to accurately calculate predicted job loss. "There’s been no soda tax, so you don’t have any experience who has actually seen what the effects are," he said. "So you end up trying to guess, and you get into this game of ‘your guess is as good as mine.’" Our Rating The Teamsters claim they stand to lose as many as 2,000 jobs in the region and "countless" others if Philadelphia implements a soda tax. This estimate is higher than any estimate floated before and tops what studies show the impact would be. And, at the end of the day, it’s nearly impossible to predict exact job loss as the result of a tax that hasn’t been implemented anywhere else in this way before. Is it within the realm of possibility that 2,000 beverage industry employees would lose their jobs due to the soda tax? Maybe. Is it likely? Not at all. We rate this claim False.

pomt-00742	Says Loretta Lynch’s nomination "has been now sitting there longer than the previous seven attorney general nominees combined."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/20/barack-obama/loretta-lynch-nomination-delayed-attorney-generals/	Democrats have recently been accusing Senate Republicans of obstructing the nomination of Loretta Lynch to succeed Eric Holder as attorney general. Lynch, currently the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, would become the first African-American woman to head the Justice Department, but she’s been awaiting a confirmation vote by the full Senate for several months. While observers expect Lynch to win confirmation, the Senate’s Republican majority has been withholding a vote as leverage to secure other legislative items. In addition, some Republicans have taken issue with Lynch’s refusal to speak out against President Barack Obama’s executive actions on immigration, which some in the GOP have called unconstitutional. Obama himself decried the delay at a joint press conference with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi on April 17, 2015. Obama called it a "crazy situation where a woman who everybody agrees is qualified, who has gone after terrorists, who has worked with police officers to get gangs off the streets, who is trusted by the civil rights community and by police unions as being somebody who is fair and effective and a good manager -- nobody suggests otherwise -- who has been confirmed twice before by the United States Senate for one of the biggest law enforcement jobs in the country, has been now sitting there longer than the previous seven attorney general nominees combined." We wondered: Has Lynch’s nomination been "sitting there longer than the previous seven Attorney General nominees combined"? We looked at data from the Senate about the past seven nominees. Here’s a rundown, in reverse chronological order: Nominee President Nomination received by Senate Confirmed by Senate Days Eric Holder Obama Jan. 20, 2009 Feb. 2, 2009 13 Michael Mukasey G.W. Bush Sept. 21, 2007 Nov. 8, 2007 17 Alberto Gonzales G.W. Bush Jan. 4, 2005 Feb. 3, 2005 30 John Ashcroft G.W. Bush Jan. 29, 2001 Feb. 1, 2001 3 Janet Reno Clinton Feb. 26, 1993 Mar. 11, 1993 13 William Barr G.H.W. Bush Oct. 25, 1991 Nov. 20, 1991 26 Richard Thornburgh Reagan July 25, 1988 Aug. 11, 1988 17 TOTAL 119 So the previous seven nominees waited a collective 119 days. How about Lynch? Here it gets a little complicated. Lynch’s nomination was initially received in the Senate on Nov. 13, 2014. The Senate -- then under lame-duck Democratic control -- did not move the nomination forward. One obvious problem, beyond a short calendar interrupted by Thanksgiving and Christmas breaks: Rushing the nomination through might have been seen as thwarting the will of the people, who had just voted for a Republican Senate. Then, the Obama administration resubmitted Lynch’s nomination to the newly Republican-held chamber on Jan. 7, 2015. That’s standard procedure when one Congress ends and another begins. If you count the entire period -- from Nov. 13 to April 17, the day of Obama’s remark -- then Lynch had waited for 155 days (and 158 by this article’s publication date). That’s easily more than the 119 logged by the previous seven nominees. However, if you count only the time after the Republicans took over the Senate -- the period for which Obama’s obstructionism argument is strongest -- the delay was 100 days by the time of Obama’s comments, and 103 by this article’s publication. That’s less than the 119 days waited by the previous seven nominees, though it’s possible the wait could ultimately reach or exceed 119 days if no action is taken by early May. Obama does has a point that the delay for Lynch -- however many days it was -- has been unusually long. Of the hundreds and hundreds of nominations submitted in recent decades, only a few have waited for longer than 100 days, according to the Senate Historical Office. Among the more notable waits: • Richard Cordray, nominated for director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 2011-13: 1+ years • Miguel Estrada, nominated for U.S. Circuit Court judgeship, 2003: 240 days • Richard Holbrooke, ambassador to the United Nations, 1999: 176 days • Lewis L. Strauss, nominated for Commerce Secretary, 1959: 152 days • Robert Gates, nominated for CIA Director, 1991: 134 days • Robert Bork, nominated for Supreme Court, 1987: 108 days Of these, the only nominee for an official Cabinet position to wait longer than Lynch was Strauss, and that was more than half a century ago. So Lynch’s case is pretty unusual by historical standards. Sarah Binder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a political scientist at George Washington University, sees the argument for starting the clock with the resubmission of Lynch’s nomination, but she added that focusing on that distinction misses the larger point. "Presidents are typically given the right to field their own team," Binder said. "Given Lynch's previous confirmations and stellar credentials, why force her and the president to wait so long for a confirmation vote?" Burdett Loomis, a University of Kansas political scientist who has studied the Senate, agreed. "There’s a little sleight of hand" in Obama’s comment, "but the overall message is that there’s been a lot of delay and that it’s historic in length." And it’s not as if Republicans were powerless to resist even if the Democratic-controlled Senate had tried to act, said Steven S. Smith, a political scientist and Senate expert at Washington University in St. Louis. "The Democrats could have moved the nomination quickly at the end of the last Congress if the Republicans were not requiring cloture on everything, even nominations, which created a backlog of must-pass legislation and nominations as the Congress came to a close," Smith said. Our ruling Obama said that Lynch’s nomination "has been now sitting there longer than the previous seven attorney general nominees combined." Mathematically, Obama was correct if you start counting from Lynch’s initial nomination, but short by 19 days if you start counting from the resubmission of her nomination to the newly installed Republican-controlled Senate. Either way, it’s clear that Obama has a point that Lynch’s delay has been long by historical standards, especially for a Cabinet nominee. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-05101	"If you're one of the more than 250 million Americans who already have health insurance, you will keep your health insurance."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/29/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-under-his-health-care-law-those-/	After the Supreme Court upheld the health care bill he’d signed into law, President Barack Obama applauded the decision in a speech at the White House. In that speech, Obama responded to critics, including Mitt Romney, who say the law could force many Americans off their health care plans. "If you're one of the more than 250 million Americans who already have health insurance, you will keep your health insurance," Obama said. "This law will only make it more secure and more affordable." This is a variation on a line Obama has used before, and which we have rated in the past. For instance, at a town hall meeting in New Hampshire on Aug. 11, 2009, Obama said, "If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan." We found that overly optimistic given the bill’s details at the time, so we rated it Half True. Later, Obama spoke more specifically. In a speech to a joint session of Congress in September 2009, Obama said, "If you are among the hundreds of millions of Americans who already have health insurance through your job, or Medicare, or Medicaid, or the VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have." We concluded that nothing in Obama’s proposal proactively forced such changes, and the bills clearly intended to leave much of the current health care system in place. So we rated the claim True. The claim Obama made after the Supreme Court decision on June 28, 2012, was a broader statement, and as a result, it’s less accurate. First, a March 2012 study by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress, projected that 3 million to 5 million fewer non-elderly people would obtain coverage through their employer each year from 2019 through 2022 than would have been the case before the law was passed. Including those with individually purchased policies enlarges that decline by an additional 1 million to 3 million Americans. CBO’s estimate is broadly in line with a number of other independent estimates. A study by the Urban Institute projected a decline of about 500,000 people. The Lewin Group predicted a decline of about 3 million people. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services actuary pegged the number at about 1 million fewer people. And the RAND Corp. projected that about 4 million more individuals would be covered by employment-based coverage by 2016. Why are these changes occurring? Some will be made voluntarily by Americans seeking better health care options outside of their employer’s plan, but we think it’s reasonable for Obama to ignore these changes in his calculation. Other switches will be involuntary. As we have previously noted, many Americans already lose their current health plan for reasons that have nothing to do with the new law. Your employer may change insurance carriers, for instance, or your insurance carrier may unilaterally modify the terms of your plan. How common is this? The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, found that in 2007, just over 14 percent of the entire U.S. population "switched" health insurance. However, this underestimates the rate of switching, because the study included people of all ages (including those covered by Medicare, who rarely switch) and because it doesn’t count a switch from one plan to the other within the same insurance company. The latter scenario is common. Mercer, a private consulting firm, found that in each of the years from 2005 to 2008, roughly a quarter of companies said they made changes to their plans that would result in employees paying a greater share of the cost. In 2009 and 2010, it rose to one-third. The number becomes substantial if you add up the workers who lose coverage entirely; who change jobs (voluntarily or involuntarily); who work for companies that change insurance carriers or adjust plan terms significantly; or whose employer’s insurance carrier is merged or bought out. And knowing that many workers every year are already required to change plans provides a different impression than what Obama is suggesting. Our ruling Obama has a reasonable point: His health care law does take pains to allow Americans to keep their health plan if they want to remain on it. But Obama suggests that keeping the insurance you like is guaranteed. In reality, Americans are not simply able to keep their insurance through thick and thin. Even before the law has taken effect, the rate of forced plan-switching among policyholders every year is substantial, and the CBO figures suggest that the law could increase that rate, at least modestly, even if Americans on balance benefit from the law’s provisions. We rate Obama’s claim Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-06-29T15:59:27	2012-06-28	['None']
pomt-06836	Says state Sen. Alberta Darling is "allowing mercury to harm our children" because she voted against an electronics recycling bill.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/aug/05/wisconsin-sierra-club/wisconsin-sierra-club-says-state-sen-alberta-darli/	The political arm of the Wisconsin Sierra Club is slamming Republican state Sen. Alberta Darling in direct mail pieces that mince few words about the group’s view of her environmental voting record. She "looks the other way while corporate polluters ravage our lakes, our rivers and our air." She’s a "corporate Darling" whose actions are "damaging Wisconsin’s future." The claim that jumped out at us involved a 2009 vote on a bill banning disposal of computers, TVs and other electronics in landfills or incinerators. The "e-waste" recycling bill put the onus on product manufacturers to collect obsolete goods containing heavy metals and keep them out of the trash. "Alberta Darling’s Gone Too Far," the headline in one mailer reads. "Allowing Mercury to Harm Our Children." Another mailer claims Darling "voted to allow mercury and other harmful toxins into landfills where they can seep into our water supply." With these accusations flooding mailboxes in the weeks before the August 9, 2011, recall election between Darling and state Rep. Sandy Pasch, D-Whitefish Bay, we thought we’d take a look. The ban and recycling program passed 23-10 with little fanfare and some bipartisan support in June 2009 and was signed by Gov. Jim Doyle. Five Republican senators joined the majority. Twenty-five states, including Minnesota, now have such programs. Darling felt the fees and recycling requirements on manufacturers were excessive, said Andrew Davis, her campaign manager. In the end, Darling, as the Sierra Club claims, did vote against the bill. But the main thrust of the claim is that her "allowing mercury to harm our children" vote will "allow mercury and other harmful toxins into landfills where they can seep into our water supply." The political director of the Sierra Club, David Blouin, said the claim is justified because the goal of the bill was to keep mercury and other toxins out of the waste supply. "If it’s going into landfills, which all eventually leak, that threatens our water supplies," Blouin said. "Any increase (in mercury waste) via reduction of regulation allows mercury to harm our kids, or potentially could." That’s a strong statement, but with a couple of big "ifs." Let’s examine the evidence. The nonpartisan U.S. General Accountability Office in 2005 reviewed studies on e-waste and found that, by one account, 100 million computers, monitors, and televisions become obsolete each year and that the level is growing. Research showed two major concerns: the loss of natural resources such as copper, and the potential release of toxic substances in the environment. "EPA has identified lead, mercury, and cadmium (which are typically found in computers or monitors), as priority toxic chemicals for reduction under an agency program, the GAO reported. "According to EPA, these toxic substances do not break down when released into the environment and can be dangerous, even in small quantities." EPA’s website says that some electronics (such as color CRT computer monitors, color CRT TV tubes, and smaller items such as cell phones and other "hand-helds") test "hazardous" under federal law. The GAO report says that the Solid Waste Association of North America found an apparent increase in lead from used electronics showing up in municipal landfills. And "tests conducted at the University of Florida indicate that lead leachate from color computer monitors and televisions with CRTs"... could be considered hazardous waste under federal rules. But GAO added that the Florida researcher cautioned that his findings don’t necessarily mean it would leak from a modern landfill. And GAO noted that the Solid Waste Association declares municipal landfills as safe for managing used electronics "without exceeding toxicity limits." The GAO’s bottom line: "Regarding the issue of toxicity, the research we reviewed is unclear on the extent to which toxic substances may leach from used electronics in landfills." We heard the same kind of terminology about possible risks from other experts: A Congressional Research Service report to lawmakers in 2002 said that "disposal of these products, when they become "e-waste" at the end of their useful lives poses major potential environmental problems." "There is a possibility eventually that metals leach out over time," said Sarah Murray, a Wisconsin DNR employee who heads Wisconsin’s e-cycle program. That’s what drove states to implement the laws. The new program ended an exemption for households and electronics disposal. The new program, Murray said, has boosted recycling through drop-off programs: 30 million pounds of various categories of electronics have been recycled since the law kicked in. "It’s hard to say absolutely that there is less in landfills, but people have used it," Murray said. Barbara Kyle, national coordinator of the San Francisco-based Electronics TakeBack Coalition, called e-waste laws common sense preventive measures. In Wisconsin, Kyle said, there was little resistance by manufacturers to the bill. "It could cause harm, and it’s a waste of resources," she said. "Can you prove it ever got into the water stream? No, you can’t prove a link because (electronics) are all crunched up with other garbage." We’ll give the final word to Brad Wolbert, Wisconsin DNR’s chief of recycling and solid waste. Wolbert told us it’s true that landfill liners don’t last forever. And it’s true, he said, that mercury can get into landfill gas and escape. And DNR believes it makes sense to divert electronics from landfills. But it’s a stretch to say that harm has already come, or will come, to anyone from metals in discarded electronics, Wolbert said. "Nobody knows," he said. Let’s dig out. There’s little doubt that disposal of electronic products is a serious environmental issue involving hazardous substances. There is an element of truth in that Darling voted against the bill that aims to prevent harm. The Sierra Club mailers, though, push past what is known and attack Darling for "allowing mercury to harm our children." That day could come -- or not. But nobody claims it has already arrived. The statement earns a Mostly False on the Truth-O-Meter.	None	Wisconsin Sierra Club	None	None	None	2011-08-05T18:45:29	2011-07-23	['None']
pomt-11730	"Under Trump’s new tax plan … 99.8% of Americans" get "not one nickel" in tax cuts.	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2017/dec/13/kelda-helen-roys/claim-998-americans-wouldnt-get-tax-cut-under-gop-/	Kelda Helen Roys picked an unusual way to become the latest of the major Democrats to join the 2018 race for governor of Wisconsin. She announced her candidacy on a private Facebook page. Roys, a former Wisconsin state representative from Madison, undoubtedly will be training her sights on GOP Gov. Scott Walker, who is seeking a third term. But on Dec. 1, 2017, six days before her Facebook announcement, Roys used social media in a different way to criticize tax reform efforts by President Donald Trump and other Republicans. She posted this tweet: Never let the GOP tell you again that they support low taxes. They don’t—unless you’re already a billionaire or a massive corporation. #TaxBill (Attached was the graphic shown above.) Many have criticized the proposed GOP tax cuts as favoring the richest. But 99.8 percent of Americans wouldn’t get any tax cut? That’s not correct. Not close. The estate tax Roys told us she was referring to an April 2017 Facebook post by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. That post blasted Trump’s proposal to repeal the estate tax, and it included the figures about the Waltons, the Koch brothers and Trump’s family that were part of Roys’ tweet. Sanders’ post also said "99.8 percent of Americans would not benefit by one nickel under Trump’s plan to repeal the estate tax." So, Sanders was clearly referring to only one tax reform provision: repeal of the estate tax. We’ve rated True a claim by U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., that what some call the "death tax" was paid by only "two out of every 1,000 people" in 2016. That’s the equivalent of 99.8 percent. The tax applies only if an estate’s value exceeds $5.45 million, or $10.9 million, if there is a surviving spouse, and is paid by only about 5,000 estates per year. But Roys’ tweet was making a general reference to Trump’s tax plan -- with no indication that the numbers referred only to the estate tax. And its bottom-line claim was that "under Trump’s new tax plan … 99.8% of Americans" get "not one nickel" in tax cuts. Roys told us she now realizes that what she posted did not make it clear she was referring only to the estate tax. Indeed, a reader could only assume her claim was about the tax plan generally, with the "#TaxBill" reference she used and the "Trump’s new tax plan" in the headline. As for the House and Senate tax reform plans now in play, with Republicans hoping to finalize a plan for Trump’s signature before the end of 2017, several tax-cut provisions benefit the rich specifically. But the tax cuts would be widespread: Both plans would lower individual income tax rates for the middle class, and most people in lower-income households would see cuts, as well. Our rating Roys said that "under Trump’s new tax plan … 99.8% of Americans" get "not one nickel" in tax cuts. Roys said she was referring to the Republican proposal to repeal the federal estate tax, which would only benefit the wealthiest and does not apply to 99.8 percent of Americans. But her tweet made no reference to the estate tax. It gave the impression she was referring to Trump’s overall tax plan. That plan has its critics, including those who believe it gives too much to the rich. Nevertheless, as has been widely reported, the plan offers widespread tax cuts.

Every other person in this field wants to allow people who are here illegally to be able to stay here, in one form or another."	false	/iowa/statements/2015/nov/08/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-claims-hes-only-candidate-who-doesnt/	Presidential candidate Rick Santorum cast himself as the only candidate in the 15-person Republican field who opposes legal status for undocumented immigrants. "I am the only person in this field who is against amnesty," Santorum said during remarks at the Republican Party of Iowa’s Growth and Opportunity Party event on Oct. 31. "Every other person in this field wants to allow people who are here illegally to be able to stay here in one form or another." Of the 15 candidates in a GOP race that has focused heavily on immigration, is Santorum really the only one who’s "against" amnesty? As previous fact checks on similar statements have noted, "amnesty" is a tough word to define, and can mean different things to different people. Santorum offers a pretty succinct definition in his statement, though, by noting that other candidates would "allow people who are here illegally to be able to stay here, in one form or another." In a follow-up email, a campaign staffer said Santorum defines amnesty as "providing legal status to illegal immigrants." Fellow presidential candidate U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas has made similar statements, which we’ve previously found to be Mostly True. Santorum’s statement differs in important ways, however. In August and again in September, Cruz said "a majority" of GOP candidates have supported amnesty — wording that acknowledges some candidates’ views may have shifted over time. Santorum, by contrast, asserts that every other candidate currently supports an immigration policy that could be defined as amnesty. That’s a much higher standard — and a harder one to support. Let’s review each candidate individually, starting with those who have clearly indicated support for citizenship or legal status that meets Santorum’s definition of amnesty: Jeb Bush: The former Florida governor has made clear that he supports immigration reform that would provide legal status to the millions of undocumented people currently living in the U.S. Marco Rubio: The Florida senator was a member of the so-called Gang of Eight who pursued comprehensive immigration reform that included a path to citizenship. He has since taken more hardline views on immigration but still supports legal status for undocumented people currently living in the U.S. Lindsey Graham: The senator from South Carolina was also a member of the "Gang of Eight" who led efforts to pass immigration reform in 2013, and supports a pathway to citizenship. Carly Fiorina: The former Hewlett-Packard CEO said in June that she was open to legal status for the undocumented. John Kasich: The Ohio governor has said he "doesn’t like the idea of citizenship" but believes it may be necessary. George Pataki: The former New York governor supports legal-resident status for undocumented immigrants who have no criminal history and agree to 200 hours of community service. Jim Gilmore: The former Virginia governor supports legal status allowing undocumented immigrants to work in the United States, but opposes a pathway to citizenship. Other candidates supported citizenship or legal status in the past, but have tempered or reversed their views since entering the presidential race: Rand Paul: In 2013, the Kentucky senator told undocumented immigrants in a speech that "We will find a place for you" and implied (according to the New York Times) that he supported a pathway to citizenship. In more recent presidential campaign materials, though, Paul states that he "opposes amnesty" and believes the U.S.-Mexico border must be "secured" before "issuing any visas or starting the legal immigration process." Mike Huckabee: The former Arkansas governor has indicated support for a pathway to citizenship in the past, but used much tougher rhetoric this year, stating that he opposes "amnesty" and is unwilling discuss legal status until the border is secure. Chris Christie: In 2010, the New Jersey governor plainly said he supported a path to citizenship. Last May, however, he said he opposed a pathway to legal status. Donald Trump: Trump’s views on immigration have evolved over time, but his position now is among the toughest in the GOP field. He reportedly was supportive of the DREAM Act in a 2013 meeting with immigration activists and said just last July that he could support a "merit-based" system for allowing undocumented immigrants to remain in the U.S. Since then, though, he’s advocated for deporting all of the estimated 11 million undocumented people living in the country. Finally, in direct contradiction to Santorum’s claim, some candidates have simply never supported amnesty as his campaign defines it. Ben Carson: In a 2014 op-ed in National Review, the retired neurosurgeon proposed a guest-worker program for immigrants, but said all participants would have to apply from outside the United States — meaning undocumented immigrants currently living in the U.S. would have to leave and apply to re-enter. Bobby Jindal: Despite an op-ed endorsing legal status in 2013, the Louisiana governor has repeatedly refused to take a position on the millions of undocumented immigrants currently living in the U.S since becoming a presidential candidate. He argues that the border must be secured before devising a policy to address those already living here. Ted Cruz. He has repeatedly stated that he’s the only candidate in the race who has never supported amnesty – statements that have been found to be Mostly True. Cruz voted against the 2013 Senate immigration bill and opposed a 2014 House proposal to grant more limited legal status to undocumented immigrants. Correspondence with Santorum’s campaign team makes clear his statement was aimed at drawing a contrast with Cruz, who’s lately been gaining momentum in the GOP race. A Santorum aide pointed to a series of amendments Cruz offered to the 2013 reform bill, which laid out additional conditions for granting legal status to those who are undocumented. Among other measures, those amendments removed the bill’s pathway to citizenship and made it more challenging for undocumented residents to receive legal status. Santorum’s campaign says those amendments amount to support for amnesty, but they could just as easily be read as efforts to weaken the bill and undermine the amnesty measures it contained. Our ruling Santorum said, "I am the only person in this field who is against amnesty. Every other person in this field wants to allow people who are here illegally to be able to stay here, in one form or another." While it’s true that seven of 15 GOP candidates currently support policies that meet Santorum’s definition of "amnesty," four candidates who once supported such policies no longer do, and two more have consistent records of opposition. The last, Jindal, hasn’t outlined his position. We rate Santorum’s claim False.	None	Rick Santorum	None	None	None	2015-11-08T08:06:14	2015-10-31	['None']
pomt-12250	Tax cuts approved and those proposed in his state budget "will exceed $8 billion by the time the budget is done."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jul/12/scott-walker/walker-tax-cuts-will-exceed-8-billion-if-budget-pr/	While Wisconsin’s budget remains stalled in the Legislature, Gov. Scott Walker is counting on it to increase the total amount of tax cuts generated during his tenure by at least $3.3 billion. In a recent appearance on Jay Weber’s WISN (1130-AM) talk show, Walker claimed that tax cuts approved and those included in his budget proposal "will exceed $8 billion by the time the budget is done." This isn’t the first time the governor has boasted about tax cuts. As part of his 2014 re-election bid, as well as his unsuccessful 2016 presidential bid, Walker pledged to reduce the tax burden on Wisconsinites and Americans. In his January State of the State address, Walker touted that state taxes had been cut by a cumulative $4.7 billion since he took office. In 2015, we fact checked that $4.7 billion tax cut claim and found it to be on the money. Is Walker right about the $8 billion mark? Looking at the numbers In our 2015 item, we noted that the vast majority of the $4.7 billion in tax cuts came from the 2011 manufacturing and industry tax cut and a 2013 income and property tax cut. Walker’s new claim still hinges on those 2011 and 2013 tax cuts and since there is a longer period of time involved, the reduction from them is larger as well. The new number comes from estimates by the Wisconsin State Budget Office. Walker’s office provided a copy of the spreadsheet he used to make his claim. Experts at the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau and the nonprofit Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance both looked over the numbers and consider them accurate. Walker spokesman Tom Evenson said that the governor made a conservative estimate. The budget office’s spreadsheet indicates that tax cuts will amount to $8,826,601,340 through fiscal year 2019, meaning Walker gave himself about $800 million in wiggle room. The total includes proposed tax cuts of $500 million from the pending budget, but the bulk of the total comes from existing, ongoing cuts, specifically those related to manufacturing, agriculture and the income tax. Even if the $500 million in cuts is not passed in the final budget, projections suggest he could still reach the $8 billion figure. Whatever the final budget looks like, and by extension the total of tax cuts generated under Walker, hinge on a couple of caveats. One, the budget is still being negotiated, meaning the amount in additional tax cuts he’s seeking for the next two years could change. Walker originally sought $500 million in tax cuts for the upcoming budget and has said he’s willing to negotiate this amount in light of the impasse. Two, the numbers Walker is using are estimates, not final figures. To be sure, tax cuts make up one part of the budget picture. Walker’s budgets have historically included numerous, controversial cuts to education and other areas. However, the claim at hand strictly relates to tax cuts. Our rating Walker said tax cuts approved and those proposed in his pending state budget "will exceed $8 billion by the time the budget is done." The governor made a similar claim in 2015, which we rated True. His continued claims about the size of tax cuts remain on the money. Regardless of the budget passed, the state is on track to have generated more than $8 billion in tax cuts by the end of fiscal year 2019.

pomt-09790	The Obama administration's cap-and-trade plan would create "a $1,761 yearly energy tax."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/18/lamar-alexander/alexander-claims-cap-and-trade-will-cost-consumer-/	It's hard to keep track of all those estimates about how much a cap-and-trade bill would cost American families. So, the latest prediction, coming from Sen. Lamar Alexander and other Republicans, is just adding to the confusion. In a Sept. 16, 2009, press release, the Tennessean said, "American families can’t afford a new $1,761 yearly energy tax." Similar numbers were widely posted on conservative blogs. A story on the Weekly Standard was headlined, "Obama Admin Concedes: Cap and Trade Will Raise Your Taxes by 15%." Those were new numbers to us, so we decided to look into the claim. But first, a little recap. At its heart, cap-and-trade is a simple concept: To slow climate change, the government would set a cap on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. To comply, companies such as electric utilities must either upgrade to cleaner technologies or buy credits — also known as allowances — to continue polluting. The cap-and-trade bill currently making its way through Congress was written by Reps. Henry Waxman and Edward Markey, Democrats from California and Massachusetts, respectively. Their goal is to lower carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. Under their plan, most pollution permits initially would be given out for free. But eventually, companies would have to buy those permits from the government. It's an issue we've explored several times over . Opponents of cap-and-trade argue that forcing industry to buy pollution credits is nothing more than a tax on consumers and business. Firms will have no choice but to pass the cost of buying those permits on to consumers. There has been much debate about how much those costs could be, and it's been difficult to come up with a reliable number because the bills have been changing as they move through the House and the Senate. Republicans have cited numbers as high as $3,000 per year, a claim that when it was combined with a falsehood on health care, earned our Pants on Fire rating. Republicans often refer to it as a tax, although we have found that is incorrect. Only utilities that exceed their limits would have to pay for the allowances, which does not sound to us like a tax on families. Recent estimates by the Congressional Budget Office and the Environmental Protection Agency are much lower — between $80 and $340 a year, depending on income. The new numbers spring from some Treasury Department documents recently acquired by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, through a Freedom of Information Act request. Some of the documents are from 2008, shortly after the election, according to the group, and others are undated, though they appear to be from early 2009. Nowhere in the documents does the Treasury Department cite the $1,761 figure. It seems Alexander got that number from a Sept. 15, 2009, story by Declan McCullagh, a blogger who writes the "Taking Liberties" column for CBS News. (Our calls to Alexander's office were not returned.) So it's worth noting that Alexander is relying not on a study by an economist, but on an estimate from a blogger. "The Obama administration has privately concluded that a cap and trade law would cost American taxpayers up to $200 billion a year, the equivalent of hiking personal income taxes by about 15 percent," McCullagh wrote. "A previously unreleased analysis prepared by the U.S. Department of Treasury says the total in new taxes would be between $100 billion to $200 billion a year. At the upper end of the administration's estimate, the cost per American household would be an extra $1,761 a year." We contacted McCullagh via e-mail, and he told us that he came up with $1,761 per household annually by simply dividing the number $200 billion by the number of households in the United States. According to the census, there are about 113.5 million households in the country this year. We reviewed the estimate with people involved in the climate change debate who told us there are significant flaws in McCullagh's methodology. Stephen Seidel, vice president for policy analysis and general counsel for the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said the math is too simple and doesn't reflect the true impact of the House bill, which specifies that any revenue from the plan be rebated to consumers to offset higher electrical bills they might have to pay. "What [Treasury] was looking at was a situation where 100 percent of the permits were auctioned, and ignored what would be done with revenue," he said. The Waxman-Markey bill "uses revenue to offset cost to consumers." There also have been changes to the bill since that Treasury document was created. Obama originally envisioned that every polluting permit would be sold, starting when the bill was enacted. But in the spirit of compromise, Waxman and Markey scaled back that plan by giving about 85 percent of the permits for free in the early years of the bill's implementation. Also, under the latest version of the Waxman-Markey bill, which passed the House in June, 30 to 40 percent of the revenue would go back to electric utilities to be passed on to consumers to offset higher rates they would have to pay. The money would be passed to consumers through rebates or expanded efficiency programs, and an additional 15 percent of the revenue would go directly to low-income consumers. "The bottom line is that it goes back to the consumers," Seidel said. Seidel said there's another problem with the blogger's report, as quoted by the senator: the Treasury documents report that $100 billion to $200 billion in revenue raised each year by selling those pollution permits we mentioned earlier. Alexander and McCullagh incorrectly portray them as taxes. There are legitimate questions that can be raised about how much the cost might ultimately be passed on to consumers, but it is not correct to refer to the revenue as a tax. And higher energy costs are not a sure thing. Regional cap-and-trade programs in Europe and in the northeast United States show that auctioning most or all credits have actually decreased the cost of energy, said Barry Rabe, a public policy professor at the University of Michigan. "What we've seen is that there's a lot of volatility," he said. "It's hard to make those projections and say how these things are going to work as a result. That just underscores the difficulty of attaching numbers to these things that people can live with." Alan Krueger, the Obama administration's assistant treasury secretary for economic policy, sent us this statement via e-mail: "The reporting on the Treasury memo is flat-out wrong," he wrote. "Treasury's summary is consistent with public analyses by the EIA [Energy Information Administration], EPA, and CBO, and the reporting and blogging on this issue ignore the fact that the revenue raised from emission permits would be returned to consumers under both administration and legislative proposals." We spoke with Christopher Horner with the Competitive Enterprise Institute about the documents. He conceded that they don't reflect legislation currently under consideration, but he pointed out that the Senate is planning to start from scratch on the climate issue. "Congress writes legislation for one reason," Horner said. "This [document] sets forth the administration's desire and expectations." In the meantime, McCullagh has been fielding criticism about his column. On Sept. 16 he defended his analysis and wrote that revenue returned to consumers in the form of tax cuts and rebates is uncertain. "The tax revenue might end up being directed at income tax cuts (or rescuing kittens and feeding orphans, for that matter), or it could end up being wasted on boondoggles," he wrote. "If it is returned to American citizens, it's unlikely to be a wash: some people will end up paying much more in taxes, some will pay a little more, and some will see a net benefit." But back to Alexander's original claim. His statement that households will pay $1,761 in new taxes every year is based on a blogger's incorrect assumptions and overly simple math. The estimate does not account for revenue that will be returned to consumers in the form of rebates and other efficiency measures. Furthermore, the number is based on old numbers; the Treasury estimate was written on the premise that all permits would be sold, which, ultimately, is not the form that the Waxman-Markey legislation has taken. Finally, both Alexander and McCullagh portray money raised by selling these permits as a tax. We rate Alexander's claim False.

pomt-10867	We live in "a time of historically low violent crime rates and historically high gun ownership rates nationally."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/aug/29/fred-thompson/researchers-split-about-whether-guns-reduce-crime/	Fred Thompson suggests that gun ownership reduces crime, but his commentary is backed by little more than disputed NRA statistics. In a posting on his Web site on Aug. 21, Thompson provided his take on the controversy with a commentary about New York City and its efforts to sue gun makers. "Ironically, all of this comes at a time of historically low violent crime rates and historically high gun ownership rates nationally," Thompson wrote. He went on to cite National Rifle Association figures. His statistics fall short in several ways. First, gun ownership rates are extremely difficult to calculate. The NRA used 8-year-old federal estimates and then used gun purchase figures to assume there are additional guns in the United States. However, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said it is impossible to estimate how gun ownership has grown because there is no national gun registry. Violent crime had been at historic lows, dropping between 1993 and 2004. However, the FBI reports that the estimated rate of violent crime increased 2.3 percent in 2005 and 1.3 percent in 2006. Advocates on both sides of the issue have used the statistics to argue their own cases. The neutral Congressional Research Service declared in May 2005 that there's not enough evidence on either side: "According to a recent study...none of the existing sources of statistics provide either comprehensive, timely or accurate data with which to definitively assess whether there is a causal connection between firearms and violence."

pomt-04330	"6,400 Ohioans ... lost manufacturing jobs in the month of September."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/oct/26/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-camp-says-6400-ohioans-lost-manufactur/	The national unemployment rate has ticked down slowly -- much too slowly, says Mitt Romney’s campaign -- and Ohio’s economy has generally grown. Its unemployment rate is even 0.8 percent below the national average. But the unsteadiness of the recovery, even in Ohio, underlined a recent claim by the campaign for Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate. On Oct. 22, the spokesman, Robert Reid, said in an email to reporters: "Vice President Biden may believe there is a ‘renaissance’ in manufacturing happening in the Buckeye state, but don’t tell that to the 6,400 Ohioans who lost manufacturing jobs in the month of September." Could this job loss be true? After all, didn’t the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services announce just a few days earlier that the state’s unemployment rate had gone down yet again, reaching 7.0? The answer to both questions is yes. According to the monthly survey of businesses that state and federal officials use to assess job gains or losses, Ohio’s lost 12,800 non-farm jobs in September. Jobs in manufacturing accounted for 6,400 of those job, or half the loss. This was a preliminary figure and it could be adjusted upward or downward in the coming months as more surveys are turned in. The survey, called Current Employment Statistics, is conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in conjunction with ODJFS. Sure, that seems inconsistent with the reported drop in Ohio’s unemployment, from 7.2 percent to 7.0 percent. But as many Americans have learned this year, the two numbers do not always move in the same direction. Here’s why: The unemployment rate is based on a a different and broader survey. It is not a survey of businesses. Rather, it is a civilian survey, called the Current Population Survey, and it asks people whether they are in the workforce or looking for a job. Each time someone stops looking for work -- whether it’s because he or she has retired, has given up on looking, has become self-employed or has some other reason -- that is one fewer person counted as unemployed. The unemployment rate has other factors, including the number of people who come of age and start looking for jobs. That’s why the opposite trend of what occurred in September sometimes happens: The country can gain jobs yet the unemployment rate might still rise. Economists say that a healthy economy must add enough jobs to at least keep up with adult population growth. As for the Romney spokesman’s comment, an article in The Plain Dealer by business reporter Olivera Perkins made a similar point, sans politics. It said, "Ohio’s unemployment rate down to 7 percent, though state lost jobs." Speaking to the conflicting direction of the trends -- that is, employers who reported they had fewer jobs, yet people in the workforce who nevertheless said they were, in fact, employed -- Hiram College economics professor Ugur Aker told the newspaper that gains in self-employment could explain the difference. "What is happening is that there are wage and salary jobs being eliminated," Aker told The Plain Dealer. "On the other hand, it looks like jobs are increasing because there are more people working for themselves. Is that a good thing? Bad thing? I don't know." Economic research analyst George Zeller, noting that manufacturing "has been driving this recovery," told the newspaper that the losses "are very bad news." The numbers cited by the Romney campaign were confirmed by ODJFS and the BLS. They were reported by other media, too. Romney’s spokesman made the statement in an attempt to lay political blame. Voters in Ohio will have their say on that soon enough. PolitiFact Ohio is only ruling on the accuracy of the claim about job losses in manufacturing. The statement is accurate, but some additional information is needed to provide clarification. Reid, the Romney spokesman, was citing losses from one month -- losses that totaled just shy of 1 percent. To get a better sense of changes in manufacturing employment during President Barack Obama’s term to date, consider these monthly figures provided by ODJFS and BLS. Here is what the numbers and a calculator show: From the start of Obama’s term in January 2009 to the lowest point for manufacturing in Ohio, November 2009, the state lost 9.75 percent of its manufacturing jobs. From the start of Obama’s term through the latest month reported, September, Ohio has lost nearly 2.8 percent of its manufacturing jobs. Why a lower number? Factory jobs started coming back slowly at the very end of 2009, though not robustly enough to make up for the early losses. From the lowest point for manufacturing in Ohio (November 2009) through September, a period of 34 months, Ohio has gained 7.7 percent more manufacturing jobs. What’s this tell you? That many but not all of those factory jobs lost during Obama’s term have come back. In that single sentence you have both parties’ economic messages. Curious to see another trend, we looked back further. Not to be the bearer of bad news, but you probably know this anyway: Ohio was losing manufacturing jobs for a long time. The number fell during both of George W. Bush’s terms, with Ohio losing a third of its manufacturing jobs by the end of the eight years. During Bill Clinton’s first term, the number of those jobs rose by 4.2 percent, but declined by 2.7 percent in his second term. So was the Romney campaign cherry picking its figure, given these broader trends? You might argue that, but as The Plain Dealer reported, the latest monthly jobs report troubled economists, too. It was just one monthly report and more information will be required to know if there is a trend, but it suggested a weaker recovery. And, combined with the latest unemployment number, it raised questions about the trade-offs of self-employment, perhaps at lower wages. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Mostly True.

pomt-10075	"Mr. Warren compared same-sex couples to incest."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jan/13/barney-frank/warren-gay-marriage-and-incest/	One of the first controversies faced by freshly elected Barack Obama came with his selection of evangelical Rev. Rick Warren to deliver the invocation at his Jan. 20 inauguration. Although viewed by some as a moderate, Warren's outspoken support of California's recently passed Proposition 8 — which amended the state constitution to ban gay marriage — angered some in Obama's liberal base, particularly those who support gay marriage. In the days after Obama announced that Warren would deliver the invocation, one of the popular sound bites coming from opponents was an accusation that Warren recently likened gay couples to incest. Leading the charge was U.S. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., who is openly gay. "Mr. Warren compared same-sex couples to incest," Frank said in an interview on CNN's Late Edition on Dec. 21, 2008. "I found that deeply offensive and unfair." Frank repeated his objections to Obama's pick during an interview with MSNBC the following day: "I think Rick Warren's comments comparing same-sex relationships to incest is deeply offensive, wildly inaccurate and very socially disruptive." The comments Frank is referring to come from an interview Warren gave in mid December to Steven Waldman, editor in chief of Beliefnet. Context is the critical thing here, so we'll provide a generous helping of Warren's statements to give you a complete view: Waldman: Do you support civil unions or domestic partnerships? Warren: I don't know if I'd use the term there. But I support full equal rights for everybody in America. I don't believe we should have unequal rights depending on particular lifestyles, or whatever stuff like that. So I fully support equal rights. Waldman: What about partnership benefits in terms of insurance or hospital visitation? Warren: "Not a problem with me ... I'm not opposed to that as much as I'm opposed to the redefinition of a 5,000-year-old definition of marriage. I'm opposed to having a brother and sister be together and call that marriage. I'm opposed to an older guy marrying a child and calling that a marriage. I'm opposed to one guy having multiple wives and calling that marriage." Q: "Do you think those are equivalent to gays getting married?" A: "Oh, I do. For 5,000 years marriage has been defined by every single culture and every single religion...as a man and a woman." We'll note here that Warren's statement about the 5,000-year history of marriage seems wrong on its face, given that several cultures and religions have accepted polygamy. But we're not rating that statement here, just the allegation that he compared gay couples to incest. On the one hand, Warren did throw out examples of brothers and sisters marrying (incest) or an adult marrying a child (pedophilia) in the context of explaining his opposition to gay marriage. But they were cited as examples of unions outside his definition of marriage. And he agreed that same-sex couples would be another. Warren did not, however, compare "same-sex relationships to incest" or say they are similar. He only said they all fall outside his definition of marriage. That's an important distinction. In fact, Warren noted that he is okay with partnership benefits for same-sex couples. Later in the interview, Warren noted that he has "many gay friends. I've eaten dinner in gay homes. No church has probably done more for people with AIDS than Saddlebrook Church. Kay (his wife) and I have given millions of dollars out of the Purpose Driven Life helping people who got AIDS through gay relationships. So they can't accuse me of homophobia. I just don't believe in the redefinition of marriage." For his part, Obama opposes gay marriage, though he supports extending "full and equal rights and benefits to same-sex couples under both state and federal law." And Obama opposed Proposition 8, calling it "divisive and discriminatory." While noting that he differs with Warren on some issues, Obama defended Warren's selection, saying, "During the course of the entire inaugural festivities, there are going to be a wide range of viewpoints that are presented. And that's how it should be, because that's what America is about." Frank agreed that "everybody should speak, and there could be a dialogue." But, he said, "giving that kind of mark of approval and honor to someone who has frankly spoken in ways that I and many others have found personally very offensive, I thought that was a mistake for the president-elect to do." You can argue the appropriateness of Obama's choice, and you can argue the appropriateness of Warren citing examples of incest in the context of explaining his opposition to gay marriage, but Frank distorts Warren's words when he says Warren "compared same-sex couples to incest." He didn't. He just cited them as types of relationships that should not be eligible for marriage. We rule his comment Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09031	"You know, when this thing first hit, I signed a declaration of emergency for the six counties that were directly affected, impacted in the Panhandle, then I extended that not long thereafter down into Sarasota County."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/jul/06/charlie-crist/charlie-crists-oil-response-evolved-over-time/	The Deepwater Horizon oil drilling rig exploded and caught fire in the Gulf of Mexico on the night of April 20, 2010. A week later, on April 29, as the first of many oil-soiled birds were being washed down, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency. Florida Gov. Charlie Crist also made an announcement that day. He was leaving the Republican party to run as an independent for U.S. Senate. In the weeks since waves of oil began seeping into the Gulf of Mexico, Crist has appeared on the nightly news on a near-daily basis to discuss the oil crisis. He regularly tours the Panhandle. He meets with affected business owners. And, he highlights his response to the oil disaster whenever he is in a large, bustling room. "You know, when this thing first hit, I signed a declaration of emergency for the six counties that were directly affected, impacted in the Panhandle," he told a crowd at the Florida Association of Counties conference in Tampa on July 1, 2010. "Then, I extended that not long thereafter down into Sarasota County. And then we started to hear about the loop current -- I mean we've all become sort of mini-experts in the study of this spill -- after hearing about the looper and the possibility that this could get all the way down into Monroe County and even up, you know, to Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, we extended that emergency declaration through Palm Beach County." Crist's message: I've been getting things done. But, we wondered, was Crist's response really that nimble? It wasn't until the day after he announced he was running as an independent that Crist signed a 6-page executive order declaring a state of emergency for six Florida counties: Escambia, Santa Rosa, Okaloosa, Walton, Bay and Gulf. In that April 30 order, he also tapped the state Department of Environmental Protection to coordinate the response effort. Crist added 13 more counties on May 3, extending the state of emergency south along the Gulf Coast through Sarasota County. The proclamations were good enough for Florida, but Crist still needed to let the federal government know Florida was in crisis if he wanted federal help. That step didn't come until more than two weeks after the rig explosion with a May 6 letter to President Barack Obama requesting a $50 million disaster grant from the federal Department of Labor. He later requested help from the federal Small Business Administration on May 12, which allowed business owners to qualify for federal grants. A month after the explosion, Crist extended the state of emergency further south and back up the Atlantic coast through Palm Beach County. In all, the May 20 executive order brought the number of Florida counties in a declared state of emergency to a total of 26. Crist explained his decision by citing reports that oil from the spill had entered into a loop current that could potentially carry it out to other counties bordering the gulf and the Atlantic seaboard. Crist broke out his special executive order pen one more time on June 18, extending the state of emergency through Aug. 28. "Depending on weather and ocean currents, this ecological disaster poses a potential threat to Florida's entire coastline," read the order. We weren't sure how Crist would define "when this thing first hit." For context, we looked at what the governors did in Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana, the other gulf states immediately threatened by the oil spill. Alabama Gov. Bob Riley also declared a state of emergency on April 30, but his covered the entire state. More recently, Riley reached out for some divine help when he declared Sunday, June 27, a "Day of Prayer," and urged his residents to ask God for a solution. April 30 was also a productive day for Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, who declared a state of emergency in all areas affected by the oil leak, including, "but not limited to, Hancock, Harrison and Jackson counties, the littoral areas of these counties, any state, national or international waters through which state or federal personnel shall traverse or operate in responding to this oil leak." Then there's Jindal, one of the few government leaders whose outspokenness on the oil leak might rival Crist's. Jindal was the first of the four gulf coast governors to declare a state of emergency. His came April 29 and covered the entire state of Louisiana. That same day, Jindal shared his declaration with the federal Small Business Administration, the first step in ensuring small businesses in areas ravaged by the oil spill would be eligible for low-interest loans of up to $2 million to cover basic operating expenses. He also asked that the Small Business Administration temporarily suspend loan repayments for coastal businesses impacted by the spill that had received earlier loans related to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Ike and Gustav. So, that means Crist was mostly in step with his peers when he declared a state of emergency in six Florida counties 10 days after the oil rig explosion. And he did go on to expand the emergency declaration to include 20 more counties within a month. On the other hand, of the four states closest to the oil disaster, Florida is still the only state with a limited emergency area. And, unlike Jindal, Crist did not immediately seek financial help from the federal government. Crist's initial emergency proclamation was timely and he did continue to expand it. But given that he didn't immediately reach out for federal dollars and that other gulf governors beat him to the punch by issuing broad state of emergency proclamations from the beginning -- we give him a Mostly True.

pomt-06109	Says Rick Santorum voted for the Bridge to Nowhere.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/jan/02/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-rick-santorum-voted-bridge-nowhere/	A day before the Iowa caucuses, Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s presidential campaign posted online a video that portrays rival candidate Rick Santorum as a supporter of pork-barrel spending during the 16 years he served in Congress. Calling Santorum "a porker's best friend," the video, using on-screen text, gives several examples, including that "Santorum voted to spend millions on the Bridge to Nowhere." Perry’s campaign made the same charge in a radio ad that it released in Iowa on Dec. 29, 2011. Mimicking the format of a game show, Perry's ad kicks off with an announcer asking: "Which Republican running for president voted for the Bridge to Nowhere earmark?" The "correct" answer comes from contestant "Susie from Des Moines," who responds by naming Santorum. (He represented Pennsylvania in the U.S. Senate from 1995 to 2007 after serving two terms in the U.S. House.) We wondered whether Perry was right that Santorum had voted for the now-infamous bridge project? Perry's charge takes us back to 2005, when the nearly $400 million plan to connect the Alaskan city of Ketchikan (population about 8,000) with Gravina, an island with a few dozen residents and an airport, became an object of national ridicule and a symbol of federal pork-barrel spending. Critics pointed to the bridge plan as evidence that congressional earmarking — the setting aside of federal money for pet projects — had run amok, and on Nov. 6, 2005, Parade magazine highlighted the project in a cover story with the headline "Are Your Tax Dollars Being Wasted?" The project was again thrust into the spotlight during the 2008 presidential contest. The Republican nominee, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, used the bridge to highlight his record of fighting against pork-barrel spending. And perhaps most memorably, McCain's running mate, then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, said repeatedly during the campaign that she "told Congress, 'Thanks, but no thanks,' on that Bridge to Nowhere" — a statement rated Half True by the PolitiFact Truth-O-Meter. As backup for Perry's statement that Santorum had voted for the project, the governor's campaign points to a "presidential white paper" about Santorum by the Washington-based anti-tax group The Club for Growth. The assessment of Santorum's record on economic issues in the U.S. Senate concludes that "on the whole," he was "above average." However, the paper says Santorum was weak in some areas, including on spending during the Bush administration. Santorum "voted for the 2005 highway bill that included thousands of wasteful earmarks, including the Bridge to Nowhere," the paper says, referring to a $286.5 billion federal highway and transportation bill that included about $225 million for the Gravina Island bridge project. On July 29, 2005, the U.S. Senate passed the legislation with a vote of 91-4. Santorum was among the backers of the bill. But does that prove correct Perry's statement that Santorum voted for the Bridge to Nowhere? Not quite. In other fact-checks, PolitiFact has dismissed that claim because the Senate wasn't voting yes-or-no just on the Alaska bridge. Funding for the bridge project was less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the spending in the transportation bill. However, the Club for Growth white paper points to another Senate vote related to the bridge project that took place about three months later: "In a separate vote, Santorum had the audacity to vote to continue funding the Bridge to Nowhere rather than send the money to rebuild New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina." The paper was referring to a vote on an amendment in a later transportation appropriations bill that called for stripping some funding from the Bridge to Nowhere project. The amendment, sponsored by Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., sought to redirect part of the funding to a project to rebuild the Twin Spans bridge between New Orleans and Slidell, La., which had been damaged during Hurricane Katrina. The amendment failed 82-15. Santorum was in the majority, voting against killing the funding for the Bridge to Nowhere. After the amendment's defeat, lawmakers hashing out differences between the House and Senate measure of the appropriations bill removed the earmark for the bridge project and instead provided the money directly to Alaska's transportation department to spend on whatever projects it saw fit. That funding still could have gone to the Ketchikan-Gravina Island span, but ultimately the bridge was never built. After Perry's earmark-related attack in Iowa, Santorum defended his record in interviews. Speaking with Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly on Dec. 29, Santorum said: "If you look at the Constitution, the Constitution gives the power of the purse to the Congress, and the Congress is the one that's supposed to spend the money. And so the idea that earmarks are somehow against the Constitution or something that is illicit that a congressman … shouldn't do is just simply factually incorrect." Santorum also said that since leaving Congress, he has defended his earmarks because he is proud of the money that he set aside "for things that were priorities in my state, instead of having bureaucrats do that." But, Santorum said, he now recognizes that Americans view earmarks as "a pox upon the Congress" and as president, he would oppose them. The same day, Santorum addressed Perry's "Bridge to Nowhere" charge specifically, according to a Des Moines Register news article. The story says Santorum, speaking to reporters while on the campaign trail in Iowa, acknowledged that some earmarks are controversial. "People say that I voted for the Bridge to Nowhere," Santorum said, according to the Register story. "I did. I went with the federalist argument, which is: 'Who am I in Pennsylvania to tell Alaska what their highway priorities should be?' You had a city that was separated from its airport and of course in Alaska, you have to travel by air, and you had to have a ferry. There were times when they couldn’t get across." Our ruling Perry said that as a senator, Santorum voted for the Bridge to Nowhere. Santorum did, a charge that he hasn't disputed. He voted for a giant spending bill that included money for the bridge project and then later voted to maintain federal funding for the project. On the Texas Truth-O-Meter, an accurate statement that could benefit from such clarification or additional material is considered Mostly True. And so it is.

pomt-00991	"There haven't been tax cuts for the rich" in Rhode Island.	false	/rhode-island/statements/2015/feb/08/nicholas-mattiello/house-speaker-nicholas-mattiello-says-rhode-island/	Taxes were one of the topics that WJAR-TV reporter Bill Rappleye raised when he interviewed House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello during the Jan. 18 edition of "10 News Conference." Rappleye referred to a report showing that poor people in Rhode Island pay more taxes per person than in other states. Then he asked Mattiello, " Is there a way to change that?" The speaker said the solution was to, "Lift up the middle class." "Our middle class revenue is just not what it should be," Mattiello said. "Let's lift everybody up and we'll be competitive with other states. So that's my approach for dealing with it, not changing rates and not charging our more successful folks more money. I think the middle class has been squeezed for a long time." "And the tax cuts for the rich don't contribute to that?" Rappleye said. "There haven't been tax cuts for the rich. I'm not sure when folks refer to that, I'm not sure what they're referring to. So if you can point to the tax cuts for the rich, I'll be happy to consider that," Mattiello said. "But, realistically, there's never been tax cuts for the rich." That sparked an immediate request from a few readers to have PolitiFact Rhode Island check his assertion. One reason: in 2010, the General Assembly, when Mattiello was House Majority Leader, lowered the top tax rate for the state's highest earners. That rate was 9.9 percent for income that exceeded $336,550 and in state-by-state rankings, it stood out like stink bomb at a flower show. So the legislature, with the blessing of then-Governor Donald Carcieri, brought the top rate down to 5.99 percent. Thus was born the idea that Rhode Island had given a big tax break for the rich, prompting calls by some legislators to bump the rate up to 7.99 percent for all earnings above $250,000. But, as in all things taxes, it's not that simple. We'll return to the 2010 changes. But first we should travel further back to 2006, a year before Mattiello joined the General Assembly and the year a tax overhaul passed that was designed to increasingly benefit the wealthy Instead of the top tax rate of 9.9 percent, the legislature and then-Governor Donald Carcieri gave taxpayers the option of paying a flat 8.0 percent of their adjusted gross income if they gave up taking credits and deductions. Each subsequent year, that tax cap dropped another 0.5 percentage points. It would have fallen to 5.5 percent if the General Assembly hadn't done its 2010 tax overhaul. When it was proposed, the 2006 change wasn't billed as just a tax cut for the rich. In announcing the plan, then-House Majority Leader Gordon Fox told the conservative Heartland Institute, "This will undoubtedly help the state's highest wage-earners. But I am proud that this tax package also helps low-income wage earners and the middle class." As Larry Berman, Fox's spokesman pointed out to Heartland at the time, the plan was designed to entice the well-to-do. "These are people making $250,000 and above, and when they want to create jobs, they look at Massachusetts and see a 5.3 percent income tax, Connecticut with a 5.0 percent tax, and Rhode Island with a 9.9 percent tax. They make a choice on where to move and create jobs, and that difference in tax rates is a big factor in the choice they make." So this was clearly an effort to entice the rich and bring them to -- or keep them in -- Rhode Island. In each succeeding year, as the percentage fell, more well-off taxpayers took advantage of it. So by the time the 2010 tax law lowering the top rate was passed, many of the rich weren't paying taxes at the 9.9 percent rate anyway. On the other side of the ledger, in 2009 the rich took a hit when the legislature approved another bill, one that taxed capital gains, which is the profit from the sale of stocks and other investments, as regular income. Capital gains had been taxed at a special reduced rate. Now back to the 2010 legislation, and the tax rates now in effect. Those tax changes did more than lower the top rate. It rejiggered the whole tax structure. Instead of the 9.9 percent rate kicking in for income that exceeded $336,550, the new 5.99 percent rate applied to all income above $135,000. Five levels of taxation were transformed into three. The standard deduction went up. So did the personal exemption. The legislation also phased out most credits and itemized deductions as a person's income rose, and shifted some of the tax burden to non-residents. When we asked Mattiello's office about the Speaker's claim, Berman sent us a projection from the state's Office of Revenue Analysis done when the changes were being considered. It used tax data from 2008 and compared what people would pay under the old and new systems. We also looked at a later analysis done at the end of 2010, after passage. Both showed the same pattern. Here are the December 2010 numbers: Adjusted gross income Change in average tax paid Number of returns $1 to $12,500 $13 decrease 109,181 $12,501 to $20,000 $29 decrease 61,217 $20,001 to $30,000 $35 decrease 68,407 $30,001 to $40,000 $21 decrease 55,383 $40,001 to $55,000 $24 decrease 62,776 $55,001 to $75,000 $64 decrease 63,230 $75,001 to $110,000 $91 decrease 70,347 $110,001 to $175,000 $350 decrease 48,206 $175,001 to $250,000 $113 increase 14,322 $250,001 to $500,000 $152 increase 9,791 $500,001 to $1 million $955 increase 3,561 $1 million to $5 million $2,276 increase 2,276 $5 million to $10 million $5,159 increase 269 Over $10 million $9,562 increase 340 So compared to what the average tax bill would have been without the changes, higher-income taxpayers -- those with adjusted gross incomes of over $175,000 -- actually paid more. The average filer in that group (representing about 8 percent of filers) paid $574 extra compared to what they would have paid under the previous system. So the rich did not get a big tax break from this law. Finally, there was a major change in the estate tax that passed in 2014. Under the old system, if an estate was worth $921,655 or less, no estate tax was assessed. But if the value was even a dollar higher, the full value of the estate was taxed. Under the 2014 change, the tax only kicks in when the estate is valued at more than $1.5 million. More importantly, the all-or-nothing provision, sometimes called "the cliff," was eliminated and only the portion in excess of $1.5 million is subject to the tax. In addition, the limit is now tied to inflation. The change translates into a collective tax savings of $64,400 to the heirs of someone whose estate is worth more than $1.5 million. The degree to which this change benefited the rich is a matter of debate. If you believe, to paraphrase Mitt Romney, "Estates are people too," than this was a big tax break for the wealthy, saving them up to $64,400 in taxes per estate. In addition, supporters of the proposal said it was designed to prevent wealthy people from leaving the state before they die. Wealth tends to run in families, and not a lot of poor people were lobbying for this tax break. But just because someone's a millionaire doesn't mean that their heirs are rich, and the heirs are the ones who get extra inheritance, thanks to the new law. "The middle income got the best break because they got rid of the cliff," said John Simmons, executive director of the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council. "I think the old system was hurting a lot of lower income people," said Patricia Thompson, former chairwoman of the federal and state taxation committee of the Rhode Island Society of Certified Public Accountants. "The wealthy will get a break because the exemption is raised to $1.5 million just as everyone else would, but I wouldn't say it was geared to them at all." Thompson and other people we interviewed suggested that the best source of information on this would come from Paul Dion, chief of the Office of Revenue Analysis for the Rhode Island Department of Revenue. But Gov. Gina Raimondo's office refused to make Dion available for an interview. Our ruling House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello said, "There haven't been tax cuts for the rich" in Rhode Island. He later specified a time frame: Never. The 2010 tax changes -- which dropped the top tax rate by four percentage points -- is often regarded as a tax cut for the rich, but the wealthy actually paid more. They also paid more after the 2009 change, which called for taxing capital gains as ordinary income. But we only had to go back to 2006 to find tax legislation that argues against his point. Although no longer in effect, it imposed an ever-lower cap on state taxes that benefitted more and more rich people as the tax cap dropped lower and lower. And the 2014 change in the estate tax meant that wealthier estates weren't taxed as heavily. Overall, we believe the rich disproportionately benefit from this change even though all heirs, paupers and princes alike, get the same break. On balance, the PolitiFact Rhode Island judges rate his statement False. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com. And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.) (Corrections: Gordon Fox was House Majority Leader when he talked to the Heartland Institute about the 2006 tax changes.

pomt-06176	"The Obama administration just issued instructions that terrorism training should not involve any reference to Islam."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/14/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-obama-administration-issued-ins/	Republicans on the presidential campaign trail regularly suggest that President Barack Obama is soft on terrorism and too tolerant of what they say is an enduring threat from Islamic radicals. Obama batted away such appeasement charges at a Dec. 8, 2011, news conference, but the insinuation arose again during a two-person foreign policy debate on Dec. 12, 2011, between former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. at St. Anselm College in New Hampshire. Gingrich said American efforts to combat terrorism under Obama had no coherent theme, unlike the Cold War-era theory of "supporting everybody who is not a communist." In fact, Gingrich said, "The Obama administration just issued instructions that terrorism training should not involve any reference to Islam. Well, that would be like talking about the Cold War and not mentioning communism. How do you describe ‘radical Islamist’ if you're not allowed to say ‘radical Islamist?’ It's a willful denial of reality on a scale that is breathtaking." Could Gingrich be right on this one? His campaign spokesman, R.C. Hammond, referred PolitiFact to several documents Hammond said were germane. Most critically, Hammond cited a speech by Deputy Attorney General James Cole on Oct. 19, 2011, at a "Conference on Post-9/11 Discrimination," which followed revelations by Wired that training material used by the FBI unfairly stereotyped Muslims. One of the documents, for example, referred to the Prophet Mohammad as a "cult leader," and said jihad and "Just War" traditions were part of the "strategic themes and drivers" in Islamic law. "The strategic themes animating these Islamic values are not fringe; they are main stream," the document stated. The report of the loaded language about Islam drew criticism from the Arab American Institute and other groups, and Cole’s speech appeared to be a response. Cole warned of "stereotyping" and said, "All of us must reject any suggestion that every Muslim is a terrorist or that every terrorist is a Muslim. As we have seen time and again – from the Oklahoma City bombing to the recent attacks in Oslo, Norway – no religion or ethnicity has a monopoly on terror." Even more to the point, Cole said, "We also are working comprehensively to ensure that every aspect of the Department’s work reflects sensitivity and respect for all peoples and faiths. As just one example, to that end, I recently directed all components of the Department of Justice to re-evaluate their training efforts in a range of areas, from community outreach to national security, to make sure they reflect that sensitivity." While the speech did not ban "any reference to Islam," Hammond, Gingrich’s spokesman, also referred to a report on Cole’s speech in the right-leaning The Daily Caller, which said the "Obama administration was pulling back all training materials used for the law enforcement and national security communities, in order to eliminate all references to Islam that some Muslim groups have claimed are offensive." In a phone interview the day after Gingrich made his claim, Justice Department spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said Cole’s speech never did what Gingrich asserted it had. "No one has ever said we are barring the word ‘Islam’ from training materials," she said. And James Zogby, the founder and president of the Arab American Institute, who had raised concerns about the FBI material, also said Gingrich was overstating what had taken place. "There’s been no order, no banning. No decision has been made, other than let’s evaluate and see whether (the training materials) are helping or hurting," said Zogby, who said he discussed the matter with someone in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights division after being contacted by PolitiFact. "An evaluation does not constitute a banning." Asked whether he believed a discussion of Islam was appropriate in the counter-terror training, Zogby, a Catholic with a Ph.D. in Islamic studies, said yes, because "it’s a misunderstood religion, we need to know more about it … Should law enforcement be studying the religion? Of course they should, but they should be studying it as it is and not as bigots imagine it." While the Justice Department denial certainly calls into question Gingrich's statement, Hammond, his spokesman, also cited a Talking Points Memo story on the training material controversy that focused on Dwight Holton, the former U.S. attorney in Oregon. Holton, who was in office when Mohamed Osman Mohamud was arrested in November 2010, after allegedly trying to detonate what he believed was a car bomb at a Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland, Ore., told TPM, "I want to be perfectly clear about this: training materials that portray Islam as a religion of violence or with a tendency towards violence are wrong, they are offensive, and they are contrary to everything that this president, this attorney general and the Department of Justice stands for." The Gingrich camp highlighted a portion of that story that said the 37-page complaint against Mohamud, a Somali-American, did not state that he was a Muslim. Holton said what was "relevant is the violence," not his religion. Some other evidence to consider: a 12-page document released by the White House in August 2011, "Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States," wades into the complicated challenge authorities face in dealing with potential efforts to radicalize Americans. "Groups and individuals supporting al-Qaida's vision are attempting to lure Americans to terrorism in order to create support networks and facilitate attack planning, but this also has potential to create a backlash against Muslim Americans. Such a backlash would feed al-Qaida’s propaganda that our country is anti-Muslim and at war against Islam, handing our enemies a strategic victory by turning our communities against one another; eroding our shared sense of identity as Americans; feeding terrorist recruitment abroad; and threatening our fundamental values of religious freedom and pluralism," the August document stated. Also, a 23-page White House document issued in December 2011, "Strategic Implementation Plan for Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States," mentions Islam only once, though it does refer more often to the threat from al-Qaida. "As President Obama emphasized, when discussing Muslim Americans in the context of al-Qaida's attempts to divide us, 'we don't differentiate between them and us. It's just us,'" the document states. More often, the December plan issued by the White House uses language like "community resilience programming" and the importance of "enhancing engagement with and support to local communities that may be targeted by violent extremists," without explicitly saying that many of those communities are, in fact, Muslim-American. The Ruling There is no question that the Obama administration has tried to address Islam carefully and to avoid blaming a religion with an estimated 1.6 billion adherents for terrorism. But we find Gingrich has greatly exaggerated what the Obama administration has done. Although the Justice Department clearly has yanked some questionable material related to Islam, and the recent White House document refers almost obliquely to Muslim Americans, it has not banned a discussion of al-Qaida or Islam in terrorism training. We rate his statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4a63a2e7-e660-45ca-baf0-09be0791dec4	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2011-12-14T17:26:22	2011-12-12	['Islam', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-14561	"I'm self-funding my own campaign."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/10/donald-trump/donald-trump-self-funding-his-campaign-sort/	President Donald Trump wouldn’t be beholden to special interests, he says. Why? Because billionaires aren’t paying for his campaign. "You know a lot of times you see these really dumb deals," he said of current political leaders at an Iowa rally Feb. 1. "And you'll say that's dumb. It doesn't make sense. But then when you think, it does make sense because these politicians are representing interests, whether it's a country or a company, where doing the stupid deals actually makes sense only for that politician and for that company or country." In contrast, Trump said, "I'm self-funding my own campaign. It's my money." Trump talks about self-funding his own campaign almost every day, it seems, so it’s about time we put it on the Truth-O-Meter. The fact is, Trump’s campaign isn’t 100 percent self-funded. He receives a significant amount of individual donations. But he does have a point that he puts up a lot of his own money, especially compared with other candidates (and that big-money donors are largely staying away). Contributions Trump’s campaign brought in about $19.4 million by the end of 2015. Trump contributed nearly $13 million of that himself. Most of the remainder comes from individual contributions, which federal law caps at $2,700 per candidate per election. Trump is contributing much, much more of his personal wealth than any other presidential contender. The only other candidates contributing to their own campaigns are: retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who has so far reported contributing $25,000; former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at $368,147; and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush at $388,720. Although a significant portion of his campaign funds, about 34 percent, come from individual contributions, Trump doesn’t appear to be actively soliciting these donations with high-profile fundraising events. The Sunlight Foundation, which advocates for transparency in money in politics, tracks political fundraisers with its Political Party Time tool. It has no record of any events to benefit Trump. In contrast, Political Party Time has recorded more than 280 fundraisers for Clinton and more than 150 for Bush since the start of 2015. There is, though, a "donate" button on Trump’s website. Trump also has minimal political action committee support compared with his opponents. PACs have raised just $1.8 million on Trump’s behalf, which is the lowest among all candidates still in the race, with the exception of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and Republican former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore, whose PAC fundraising for both candidates remains at $0. Trump seems to be friendly with at least one PAC created in his honor. He attended a New York fundraiser hosted by the Make America Great Again PAC in July and said he’s grateful for their support, reported Politico. The group also received a $100,000 donation from the in-laws of Trump’s daughter Ivanka. The PAC shut down in October following allegations that it coordinated with Trump’s campaign. Big asterisks It’s worth noting a couple more caveats. First, Trump’s self-financing only really picked up in the last three months of 2015. From the start of his campaign in April through October last year, individual contributions made up about 67 percent of total money raised for his campaign. Other media outlets who looked at this claim before the most recent FEC filings concluded that Trump’s claim was inaccurate because, at the time, most of his funding was coming from individual contributions. But in the last quarter, Trump gave his campaign a $10.8 million loan, turning that balance around. That brings us to the second caveat: The vast majority of Trump’s contributions to his own campaign — about $12.6 million — are loans rather than donations. This means he could expect to eventually recoup these funds. Further, of the approximately $12 million Trump’s campaign spent in 2015, about $2.7 million went toward reimbursing Trump-affiliated companies for services provided to the campaign, such as traveling in his own plane and helicopter, according to a New York Times analysis. On whether Trump should describe his campaign as self-funded, given these caveats, it’s "sort of a judgment call," said Viveca Novak, editorial and communications director at the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money in politics. "To me, it would be more accurate to say he was ‘partially self-funding,’ " Novak added. Trump’s claim is accurate in part, but it needs a big asterisk, said Richard Skinner, a policy analyst at the Sunlight Foundation. He added that all self-funders take at least some individual contributions, noting in particular former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney’s 2008 primary run. Romney provided about 44 percent of his campaign’s total funds raised, while about 56 percent came from individual donations. Rick Hasen, an expert in election and campaign finance law at the University of California Irvine, disagrees. "I don't think it is fair to say that a person is self-funding if a significant share of those contributions come from someone other than the candidate," he said. "Nor do I think a candidate who loans money to his campaign, but who expects to be paid back by the campaign, is fairly characterized as self-funding." It’s possible that Trump’s intent to self-fund his campaign could result in a president that feels less indebted to billionaires' special interests, as Trump claims, Skinner noted. But even if he isn’t taking their money, they still might have influence on Trump. "One critique of fundraising, it makes you spend a lot of time around very rich people, and Trump clearly already does that," Skinner said. Our ruling Trump said, "I'm self-funding my own campaign." As of the end of 2015, Trump’s own contributions account for more than half of all money the campaign has taken in. He’s contributed far more of his own money than any other candidate this cycle. However, a significant portion of his money comes from individual contributions. For several months last year, the campaign received far more dollars from potential voters than they did from Trump. Additionally, most of Trump’s contributions have been loans rather than donations, so he may hope to recoup those funds. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-02-10T16:00:00	2016-02-01	['None']
pomt-11186	"Thanks to the strong charter school reforms put in place while I was Senate President" the online charter school ECOT "was caught and is out of business."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2018/may/17/keith-faber/ohio-auditor-candidate-misleads-about-his-role-onl/	Investigations into the now-shuttered Electronic Classroom of Tomorrow, called ECOT, have roiled statewide elections in Ohio. The Columbus public online school launched in 2000, founded by software executive William Lager. By the end, nearly two decades later, the school received $1 billion from the state, and Lager, who once had financial problems, became a millionaire. Now politicians on both sides are spinning answers to key questions: Who is to blame for the online school bilking state taxpayers? Who gets credit for the school’s demise? The Ohio Department of Education is seeking to recoup $80 million from the school, while State Auditor Dave Yost referred his findings to state and federal prosecutors for potential criminal prosecution. State Rep. Keith Faber, the Republican candidate for state auditor, took some credit for the school shutting down. "Thanks to the strong charter school reforms put in place while I was Senate President and the diligent work of Auditor Yost and his staff, ECOT was caught and is out of business," he said in a May 11 statement to the press. Democrats pounced on Faber for taking credit. Faber’s Democratic opponent Zack Space tweeted: "Keith Faber’s complicity in this — perhaps the largest political scandal in Ohio history — should disqualify him from serving as Auditor, the top taxpayer watchdog in the State." Time for PolitiFact to weigh in: Is Faber accurate in claiming credit for ECOT shutting down? We found that when Faber was Senate president, the Legislature voted for a bill that included attendance rules for online schools in 2015. But the main reason the school shut down was a change in the type of student participation data that the state education department sought. And the department began seeking the data before the 2015 legislation passed. Faber points to House Bill 2 Faber’s spokeswoman Allison Dumski pointed to his role as Senate president in passing HB 2, a charter schools bill. The final version passed the Senate unanimously and the House overwhelmingly in October 2015. A provision added in the Senate required online schools to keep "an accurate record of each individual student's participation in learning opportunities each day." The bill said that the records must be kept in a manner that could easily be submitted to state officials. "ECOT was unable to provide these attendance records or comply with Ohio Department of Education's student count, requiring them to repay the state, which ultimately put them in financial distress and caused them to close," Dumski said. The passage of the bill drew praise from newspaper editorial boards and education advocates. But the bill essentially codified what the education department had already started. The wheels were already in motion for the state to seek millions from the school. Online school faced problems from the beginning For years, news reports showed the online charter school had problems with poor record keeping, high student turnover, suspicious attendance reports, poor performance outcomes and graduation rates, and inflated enrollment. State audits showed problems as early as 2001. While the school racked up troubling headlines, Lager (the school's founder) gave campaign donations, largely to Republicans. The Columbus Dispatch reported that Lager and other executives made $2.1 million in donations. The FBI is examining whether the company reimbursed employees for donations, the Dispatch found. (Faber announced in May that he would donate the approximately $36,000 he received to other schools.) By 2015, the state began to suspect that some schools were inflating their participation numbers. So it began to request actual log-in data for students. For ECOT, that meant trouble. The department found that for the 2015-16 school year, the online school could only account for 6,300 of its 15,300 claimed students. That eventually led the state to demand that the school repay $60 million, and later an additional $20 million for the next school year. The school argued that the department illegally changed its rules for counting students. But the courts have sided with the state. The school continues to appeal. In 2017, the state started withholding $2.5 million per month from the school. In January, the school’s sponsor, The Educational Service Center of Lake Erie West, cut off ties. Charter schools must have a sponsor to operate. About 12,000 students had to find new schools. Our ruling Faber said, "Thanks to the strong charter school reforms put in place while I was Senate President" the online charter school ECOT "was caught and is out of business." Faber was referring to House Bill 2, which passed in 2015 and required online schools to keep accurate and accessible attendance records. But Faber is overstating credit by hanging the demise of the school on that bill. The key change that led to the school shutting down was when the education department decided to require e-schools to provide student log-in data. This showed that that the school couldn’t account for many of its supposed students, leading the state to conclude the school owed $80 million. Faber doesn’t get credit for that. The only kernel of truth here is that the bill that passed under his leadership was another affirmation by the state that e-schools had to provide attendance data. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-13594	On the Iran nuclear deal	half flip	/florida/statements/2016/aug/17/tim-canova/did-debbie-wasserman-schultzs-opponent-tim-canova-/	The Iran nuclear deal has been a hot topic in the Democratic primary battle between U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz and challenger Tim Canova. The South Florida district is heavily Jewish, and Israel has been skeptical of the deal. In a mailer, Canova sided with three Jewish members of Congress who voted against the deal. "In challenging times Israel needs true friends in Congress. When called on to protect Israel, some legislators step up," states the mailer, showing photos of U.S. Reps. Ted Deutch and Lois Frankel of Palm Beach County and Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York. "Others don’t. Debbie Wasserman Schultz waffled back and forth before voting for the Iran nuclear deal, choosing party and personal political ambition over principle." But how would Canova have voted on the deal? His answers haven’t been clear. In a debate on CBS4, host Jim DeFede asked Canova to clarify his position. We decided to look at Canova’s statements about the Iran deal and put them on our Flip-O-Meter, which examines a candidate’s record on a topic without casting a value judgment on any changes. We found that Canova hasn’t really changed position, but he hasn’t always provided full answers, either. (Canova isn’t Jewish, but his stepfather is Jewish, and Canova said he has spent time in Israel including living on a kibbutz, a communal living area. Wasserman Schultz was the first Jewish woman from Florida elected to Congress.) Canova’s statements about Iran nuclear deal In 2015, Iran and five other world powers reached a deal. The agreement aims to extend the time it would take for Iran to make a nuclear bomb, subjects some of Iran’s major nuclear facilities to constant monitoring and creates conditions for lifting economic sanctions against Iran. Wasserman Schultz announced she would support the deal, saying that it wasn’t perfect but that it "promotes the national security interests of the United States and our allies and merits." On his website, Canova doesn’t say how he would have voted; however, he says that he would not support scrapping it. "While I have criticized several deficiencies in the Iran nuclear deal (no international agreement is ever perfect), now that it has been entered into, I support its full implementation," he wrote. Canova has repeatedly outlined his criticisms of the deal, including that Iran "can simply mothball rather than destroy the centrifuges, thereby allowing them to restart a nuclear program for military use in the future." He also criticizes the inspection protocols and the relief of sanctions. Canova’s most complete statements about his position on the Iran deal stem came in an interview with the Sun Sentinel editorial board in August 2016. "I expressed reservations and criticism about the Iran agreement," Canova said. "Now that it has been adopted, I am for strict implementation." When interviewed by Sentinel reporter Anthony Man, Canova acknowledged that he had made some conflicting statements. Man: "You earlier this year said that you would have voted for it." Canova: "Oh, I’ve been quoted both ways." Man: "You told me you would have voted for it. Is that accurate?" Canova: "I’m not so sure that’s accurate. Look, I’m not going to sort of play that game. I don’t know exactly how I would have voted because I wasn’t sitting in the seat, but I do know I criticized some aspects of it." Man: "In January, you said the deal wasn’t perfect, but you would have voted for it under the circumstances. You don’t believe that anymore?" Canova: "I don’t know if I would have voted for it. ... In a conversation when you called me at home you caught me off guard, I was a candidate for about a week. Did I say that? Maybe. I honestly don’t know how I would have voted for it." Editorial page editor Rosemary O’Hara asked Canova, if the deal was on the table today, how he would have voted. Canova: "I don’t know. ... I’m not a member of Congress, I didn’t have any kind of briefings the way Debbie Wasserman Schultz did, so I don’t think it's fair for me to say I would have voted for it, (or) I would have voted against it. I don’t know." In a debate on CBS4’s Facing South Florida on Aug. 14, host Jim DeFede asked Canova if he would have voted for or against the agreement. "When the question is asked as a hypothetical -- would I have seen classified information -- that’s when I have said who knows," Canova said. "But quite frankly I can say right here that was not a good agreement for a couple reasons. First of all, Iran is the biggest funder of Hezbollah and Hamas, (and) to release $100 billion in assets (to Iran) right away without doing it incrementally is what I found to be dangerous and unsettling. And quite frankly, my position is the same as dozens of other Democrats who voted against the agreement." We looked for other statements Canova made about his own position on the Iran deal. "She voted for the Iran deal, and I’m against the agreement," he told The Forward in July. Richard Bell, Canova’s campaign manager, told PolitiFact Florida that The Forward doesn’t fully explain his position. On Aug. 1, according to the Times of Israel, Canova told the Sunny Isles Beach Democratic Club: "I was critical of the Iran agreement. How would I have voted? I can’t tell you, I wasn’t a member of Congress." Bell told PolitiFact Florida that Canova’s position on the Iran nuclear agreement has been consistent. "He is critical of specific aspects of the Iran deal," Bell said. "Now that it’s been adopted, he is for its full and strict implementation." We agree that Canova has been consistent in his criticisms and in bashing Wasserman Schultz for supporting the deal. Our ruling Canova has acknowledged that he has "been quoted both ways" on how he would have voted the Iran deal. He said in January that he would have voted for it, but later in the campaign said multiple times that he didn’t know how he would have voted. He sent a mailer that didn’t say how he would have voted but sided with opponents. He has been consistent in criticizing the specifics of the deal and in criticizing Wasserman Schultz for her support for it. Because Canova’s position on the Iran deal has been unclear at different times, we give him a Half Flip. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2064790e-a998-485a-b7a8-3c25ab8b2d22	None	Tim Canova	None	None	None	2016-08-17T10:00:00	2016-08-11	['Iran']

Here's what it says: "The policy of Arkansas is to protect the life of every unborn child from conception until birth, to the extent permitted by the federal Constitution." Huckabee's statement that the amendment says "everything in the world possible" must be done to protect the unborn is pretty sharply limited by the phrase "to the extent permitted by the federal Constitution." At the moment, the Roe v. Wade decision means the federal Constitution permits abortion. It also is a slight overstatement to say the Arkansas amendment declares a belief that life begins at conception, though that certainly is implied. We also would note that he got the amendment number wrong. It is Amendment 68 that deals with abortion. Amendment 65 deals with revenue bonds.

pomt-09167	"We now actually import more oil than we did before 9/11."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/07/john-kerry/kerry-says-us-imports-more-oil-now-911/	During a June 6, 2010, appearance on ABC's This Week, Sen. John Kerry -- who is sponsoring a comprehensive energy bill -- discussed the nation's energy future against the backdrop of the ongoing oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. During an interview with host Jake Tapper, Kerry said, "Here's what's important -- not to be throwing the blame around, but to put America on the course to true energy independence and self-reliance and to begin to wean ourselves from our addiction to oil. ... The United States is losing a major economic transformational moment. Until we begin to do something -- you know, since 9/11, we now actually import more oil than we did before 9/11. It's insulting to common sense." We decided to check whether Kerry was correct about whether the United States imports more oil today than it did before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The answer is complicated, because there are at least three possible ways to measure it. • The number of barrels of crude oil imported. The U.S. imported 3.32 billion barrels of crude oil in 2000 and 3.40 billion barrels in 2001. Both figures were higher than the number imported in 2009 -- 3.31 billion barrels. By this measure, Kerry is incorrect, although just slightly. • Imported crude oil compared to domestic production. We wondered whether imported crude oil was still increasing as a percentage of all oil in the U.S., even as it dropped in absolute amounts. In fact, that's exactly what happened. In 2000, oil imports accounted for 61 percent of the total of imports and domestic production, and in 2001, imports accounted for 62 percent. In 2009, the percentage of imports was 63 percent -- slightly higher than it was in either of those years. The underlying cause was that domestic oil production declined between the start of the decade and the end. By this measure, Kerry is correct, though once again, the difference is modest. • Imported crude oil plus imported unfinished oils. William Brown, who analyzes energy data for the federal government's Energy Information Administration, told PolitiFact that in recent years, there's been a rise in imports of unfinished oils, which are partially refined, taking the place of pure crude oil imports. So he sent us data that combined those two sets of imports. In 2000, the combination of crude oil and unfinished oils accounted for 9.54 million barrels per day, and in 2001, they accounted for 9.71 million barrels per day. In 2009, that figure was 9.86 million barrels per day. Adding in unfinished oils to the previous measure of crude oil turns an incorrect statement into a correct one. Bottom line: There are three ways to analyze the question, and with two of them, Kerry is right that imports have grown. Using the other statistic, he's wrong -- imports have declined. So we rate Kerry's statement Mostly True.	None	John Kerry	None	None	None	2010-06-07T15:00:50	2010-06-06	['None']
pomt-10980	"The servers of the Pakistani gentleman that worked on the DNC" are "missing."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/16/donald-trump/missing-servers-donald-trump-vladimir-putin/	Standing beside Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump answered reporters' questions about Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and if he believed Putin’s denials over his own intelligence community’s findings. Instead of answering the question directly, Trump began discussing servers. "You have groups that are wondering why the FBI never took the server -- haven't they taken the server. Why was the FBI told to leave the office of the Democratic National Committee? I've been wondering that, I've been asking that for months and months and I've been tweeting it out and calling it out on social media. Where is the server? I want to know where is the server and what is the server saying? "With that being said, all I can do is ask the question. My people came to me, Dan Coats came to me and some others, they said they think it's Russia. I have President Putin; he just said it's not Russia. I will say this: I don't see any reason why it would be. But I really do want to see the server." Moments later, Trump added, "What happened to the servers of the Pakistani gentleman that worked on the DNC? Where are those servers? They're missing; where are they?" Trump's rhetorical question gets the details wrong. You could take Trump's words to mean a DNC server has gone missing, but that's not true. And as for the "Pakistani gentleman," Trump is referring to a House IT staffer who did not work for the DNC and who government investigators concluded did not steal or leak computer data. The DNC server On July 13, the Justice Department charged 12 Russian intelligence officers with hacking the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and Hillary Clinton campaign staffers. Special counsel Robert Mueller’s indictment confirms previous findings from the U.S. intelligence community. In April 2016, Russian intelligence officials installed spying software on the computer network of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which works to elect members of the U.S. House of Representatives. The hack in turn allowed them access to 33 Democratic National Committee computers. The emails obtained through the hack were pushed out on social media beginning in June 2016, and Wikileaks soon joined that effort. At some point, the FBI and DNC started working together to fight the hack and investigate how it happened, but DNC was slow to react to the FBI’s initial warning that their server had been compromised. During former FBI director James Comey’s testimony to the House Intelligence Committee, Comey was asked whether the FBI had ever received the DNC’s hacked hardware. He said they did not, but obtained access from a review of the system performed by CrowdStrike, a third-party cybersecurity firm. "We got the forensics from the pros that they hired which -- again, best practice is always to get access to the machines themselves, but this, my folks tell me, was an appropriate substitute," Comey said. DNC spokeswoman Adrienne Watson told PolitiFact that the DNC cooperated with the FBI’s requests, which resulted in the DNC providing a copy of their server. "An image of a server is the best thing to use in an investigation so that your exploration of the server does not change the evidence (just like you don’t want investigators leaving their own DNA around a physical crime scene) and so that the bad actors cannot make changes to the evidence while you are looking at it," Watson said. "Any suggestion that they were denied access to what they wanted for their investigation is completely incorrect." We found no indication that the FBI had renewed their request to gain access to the actual server, or that investigating the server copy would have prevented the FBI from tracking down the culprits. (The FBI declined to comment.) Imran Awan Trump said, "What happened to the servers of the Pakistani gentleman that worked on the DNC?" Trump was likely referring to Imran Awan who worked in information technology for dozens of Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives, including U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the former chair of the Democratic National Committee. Trump previously referred to Awan as the "Pakistani mystery man." Trump is wrong, though, that Awan "worked on the DNC." The national committee is a separate group from the House members. Awan’s lawyer Christopher Gowen, as well as the DNC spokeswoman, told PolitiFact that Awan never worked for the DNC. Awan, who emigrated from Pakistan as a youth, has been a U.S. citizen since 2004. "The government that Donald Trump is the president of has had the server from the very, very beginning of the investigation," Gowen said, referring to the server maintained by Awan and accessed by House Democrats, and a server all together different than the one hacked into atthe DNC. Gowen said the server was a portal that Democratic members could access when working remotely. He said it has been in possession of the FBI and the Capitol Police since the first allegations were made in the case and has nothing to do with the DNC. Awan was arrested for bank fraud in July after he identified on a home loan application that a property was a primary residence when in fact it was a rental property. Trump was parroting news reports led by the Daily Caller about Awan. Conservative media accounts suggested that Awan might have played a role in the election hacking of the DNC, although the U.S. intelligence community has concluded that the Russian government directed the recent compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations. Ultimately, Awan was charged with a minor offense unrelated to his job. In a July 3 plea agreement, Awan agreed to plead guilty to making a false statement on a loan application. The government engaged in a "thorough investigation" that included taking custody of the House Democratic server and found no evidence of wrongdoing related to his House IT job, the government stated in the plea agreement signed by U.S Attorney’s Office. "The government has found no evidence that your client illegally removed House data from the House network or from House Members' offices, stole the House Democratic Caucus Server, stole or destroyed House information technology equipment, or improperly accessed or transferred government information, including classified or sensitive information," said the plea agreement signed by the U.S. Attorney’s Office. Awan will be sentenced Aug. 21. Sentencing guidelines call for zero to six months in jail, but prosecutors agreed not to oppose a sentence of only probation. Our ruling Trump said, "The servers of the Pakistani gentleman that worked on the DNC" are "missing." The DNC servers were never missing. The DNC provided the FBI with a copy of their server, rather than the original hardware, but Comey testified that the evidence was an appropriate substitute. Awan, the "Pakistani gentleman" in the news, never worked for the DNC. Conservative news outlets suggested he had stolen a House Democratic server, but the U.S. Attorney’s Office found no evidence of such theft. We rate this statement False.

pomt-14943	"German citizens were disarmed by their government in the late 1930s," which allowed the Nazis to "carry out their evil intentions with relatively little resistance."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/26/ben-carson/fact-checking-ben-carson-nazi-guns/	Republican Ben Carson has been criticized for suggesting that gun control enabled the rise of the Nazis and led to the extermination of 6 million Jews during the Holocaust. But does he have a point? In his book, A More Perfect Union, Carson wrote that "German citizens were disarmed by their government in the late 1930s, and by the mid-1940s Hitler's regime had mercilessly slaughtered six million Jews and numerous others whom they considered inferior. "Through a combination of removing guns and disseminating deceitful propaganda, the Nazis were able to carry out their evil intentions with relatively little resistance," he wrote. Carson reiterated that argument at least twice -- in an Oct. 8, 2015, interview with CNN host Wolf Blitzer, and then again in a speech at the National Press Club. "You know, mid- to late-30s, they started a program to disarm the people and by mid- to late 40's, look what had happened," he said at the Press Club. PolitiFact decided to analyze Carson’s claim on its Truth-O-Meter. German gun laws As the Nazi Party rose to power in Germany, it inherited a 1928 gun registration law that had replaced a total ban on gun ownership imposed on a defeated Germany after World War I. The 1928 law created a permit system to own and sell firearms and ammunition. "But this order was followed quite rarely, so that largely, only newly bought weapons became registered," said Dagmar Ellerbrock, an expert on German gun policies at the Dresden Technical University. "At that time, most men, and many women, still owned the weapons they acquired before or during the first World War." When they came to power, the Nazis used whatever gun records they had to seize weapons from their enemies, but Ellerbock told us the files included very few of the firearms in circulation. "In my records, I found many Jews who well into the late 1930s possessed guns," Ellerbock told us. The Nazis adopted a new gun law in 1938. According to an analysis by Bernard Harcourt, a professor at Columbia University School of Law, it loosened gun ownership rules in several ways. It deregulated the buying and selling of rifles, shotguns and ammunition. It made handguns easier to own by allowing anyone with a hunting license to buy, sell or carry one at any time. (You didn’t need to be hunting.) It also extended the permit period from one year to three and gave local officials more discretion in letting people under 18 get a gun. The regulations to implement this law, rather than the law itself, did impose new limits on one group: Jews. On Nov. 11, 1938, the German minister of the interior issued "Regulations Against Jews Possession of Weapons." Not only were Jews forbidden to own guns and ammunition, they couldn’t own "truncheons or stabbing weapons." In addition to the restrictions, Ellerbrock said the Nazis had already been raiding Jewish homes and seizing weapons. "The gun policy of the Nazis can hardly be compared to the democratic procedures of gun regulations by law," Ellerbrock told us. "It was a kind of special administrative practice (Sonderrecht), which treated people in different ways according to their political opinion or according to ‘racial identity’ in Nazi terms." The power of a police state In short, Nazi-era Germany imposed greater gun restrictions for Jews (and other perceived enemies) at the same time it loosened gun restrictions for other groups. But that’s not what Carson said. He made a more sweeping claim about Nazis disarming German citizens. Carson then goes on to say that the lack of guns allowed the Nazis to "carry out their evil intentions with relatively little resistance." But a key turning point in the Nazi path to power illustrates that the availability of guns was not a pivotal issue. Paramilitary organizations were part of the Nazi operation from its earliest days in the mid 1920s. The Sturmabteilung, or Brownshirts, was a founding Nazi street fighting organization. Another outfit, the Schutzstaffel, or SS, provided protection to Nazi officials as they moved about the country. After Hitler won office, the SS under Heinrich Himmler became part of Hitler's inner circle, and Himmler felt the Sturmabteilung was too difficult to control. He and his collaborators concocted a rumor that the Sturmabteilung was plotting a coup. In 1934, in a span of three days, Himmler’s SS units killed between 85 and 200 Sturmabteilung leaders and other perceived enemies. Hitler himself oversaw the arrest of one of his oldest comrades, Ernst Roehm, the head of the Sturmabteilung. In the middle of that arrest, a truckload of armed Sturmabteilung troops rolled up, but not a shot was fired. Roehm was executed days later. The staff at the German Historical Institute wrote that with this operation, Hitler had managed to "legitimize outright murder on a large scale – without any legal proceedings whatsoever – and that the country largely accepted the Nazi propaganda that presented this strike as necessary." Our ruling Carson said that under the Nazis, "German citizens were disarmed by their government in the late 1930s," which allowed the Nazis to "carry out their evil intentions with relatively little resistance." This is a misreading of history on two levels. First, German citizens as a whole were not disarmed by the Nazis. Jews and other supposed enemies of the state were subject to having their weapons seized. But for most German citizens, the Nazi period was one in which gun regulations were loosened, not tightened. Second, a lack of guns was not the issue. If the majority of Germans had wanted to use these guns to fight the Nazis, they could have. But they didn’t. Carson ignores that the Nazis enjoyed significant popular support, or at least, broad acquiescence. We rate this claim False.	None	Ben Carson	None	None	None	2015-10-26T12:39:42	2015-10-09	['Germany']
pomt-09299	Says he said last year there's "absolutely no reason" for Texas to secede.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/apr/22/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-recaps-his-comment-texas-seceding-u/	Last week marked the anniversary of Gov. Rick Perry’s oft-quoted Texas-can-secede comments after a tea-party rally outside Austin’s city hall. Coincidentally, the Texas Tribune and Newsweek interviewed Perry in his Capitol office on April 15 and the opening back and forth between editor Evan Smith and Perry touched on what the governor said about secession the year before. "I always like to try to clear that up," Perry tells Smith. "It was asked as a, you know, what do you think about the people who shout out the word 'secede.' And I say that we live in an incredibly wonderful country and I see absolutely no reason for that to ever happen…" We wondered if Perry accurately recaptured his 2009 remarks. Perry's office didn't respond to our inquiry. Next, we turned to the original exchange as recorded by Kelley Shannon, Austin correspondent for the Associated Press. She spoke to him shortly after Perry spoke at the rally. (The audio and a transcript are fetchable from the "About this statement" section of this article, to the right.) According to the recording, Shannon initially asked if he thought the gathering reflected a national movement. Perry answered that it could be and that people feel strangled by spending and taxation; they want help. Shannon then asked Perry about some associating him with the idea of secession or sovereignty for Texas. Perry gave a 40-second reply, which we transcribed and provide here. "Oh, I think there’s a lot of different scenarios," Perry said. "Texas is a unique place. When we came in the union in 1845, one of the issues was that we would be able to leave if we decided to do that. "You know, my hope is that America and Washington in particular pays attention. We’ve got a great union. There is absolutely no reason to dissolve it. But if Washington continues to thumb their nose at the American people, you know, who knows what may come out of that? So. But Texas is a very unique place and we’re a pretty independent lot to boot." Perry next fielded a question from someone else about whether Texas might now be considered a natural terorrist state — no, Perry said — and the less than three-minute question-and-answer period ended. At the time, Perry’s comments were widely interpreted as indicating the Republican governor believed secession could legally occur; he subsequently did not back down from that conclusion. However, a constitutional expert advised at the time that the Civil War long ago vanquished secession as a legal option. Sanford Levinson, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said within the Texas Constitution, the U.S. Constitution and the Joint Resolution Annexing Texas to the United States of 1845, there is no explicit right for the state to return to its days as a Republic. Levinson said there is "no possibility whatsoever that the United States or any court would recognize a 'right' to secede." Levinson noted that the 1845 resolution allows for Texas to break into five new states, and it doesn’t specify whether that would require congressional approval. But, he said, that's distinct from secession. In looking back at his 2009 comments, Perry told Smith that at the time he was focusing on economics -- "people’s concern and anger about what this administration is doing from an economic standpoint in particular and the long-term debt that was being created for not only them but for future generations." All in all, does Perry accurately revisit his original comments on secession that day? For the most part, yes. However Perry doesn't get to his assertion that Texas has the right to secede or his speculation about "who knows what may come" from people angry about actions in Washington. We rate Perry’s statement as Mostly True.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2010-04-22T11:36:12	2010-04-15	['Texas']
pomt-11316	"Here are the facts: there is no massive wave of migrants pouring into California. Overall immigrant apprehensions on the border last year were as low as they’ve been in nearly 50 years (and 85 percent of the apprehensions occurred outside of California)."	true	/california/statements/2018/apr/13/jerry-brown/jerry-brown-says-theres-no-massive-wave-migrants-p/	Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown recently agreed to President Donald Trump’s request to deploy California National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, though with several caveats. Brown, for example, said state troops "will not be enforcing federal immigration laws," but will instead support operations targeting transnational criminal gangs and human traffickers. The governor said he’ll accept federal money for 400 troops, some of which would be sent to the border. Trump made the request as part of his stated effort to "seal up" the border and prevent illegal crossings. "I will not rest until we have secured our borders and restored the rule of law!" the president tweeted on April 9, 2018. White House officials have called recent border crossing figures "alarming." But in a letter to the Trump administration two days later, Brown attempted to set the record straight about what he says is really happening along California’s border with Mexico. "Here are the facts: there is no massive wave of migrants pouring into California. Overall immigrant apprehensions on the border last year were as low as they’ve been in nearly 50 years (and 85 percent of the apprehensions occurred outside of California)." With claims about border crossings boomeranging from Sacramento to Washington D.C., we decided to scrutinize the governor’s statement in a fact check. In this Sept. 15, 2015, file photo, a farmer passes along a borer fence that divides his property, Tuesday, in Mission, Texas. (AP Photo/Eric Gay) Our research To support it, the governor’s spokesman cited U.S. Border Patrol figures for apprehensions across California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. The data is from 1960 through 2017. For 2017, they show 303,916 arrests across the entire Southern border. The previous low was 263,991 in 1971, 46 years ago. So, Brown’s claim that apprehensions in 2017 were "as low as they’ve been in nearly 50 years" is on the mark. He’s also right that 85 percent of these took place "outside California." About 68 percent of the arrests took place in Texas and New Mexico, while Arizona accounted for 17 percent and California about 15 percent, according to a review of the border patrol figures. "He is absolutely correct," said Ev Meade, director of the Trans Border Institute at the University of San Diego. "Even as we’re at an historic low borderwide, it’s particularly low in California. We’re not receiving large numbers of migrants. Those migrants who are coming are largely crossing the Rio Grande and are apprehended at border patrol stations in Texas." Meade said the overall trend on the Southern border shows a dramatic decrease in apprehensions. "In the year 2000, the border patrol apprehended 1.6 million people (borderwide). For 2017, it was down to 300,000. It’s a tiny fraction," he said. Just along California’s border, nearly 390,000 people were arrested in 2000. By 2017, that number had dropped to less than 45,000, border patrol figures show. SOURCE: Trans Border Institute, University of San Diego Wave of migrants? While the governor’s numbers are right, do they prove the first part of his claim: "There is no massive wave of migrants pouring into California?" Given the context of the letter, Brown is clearly referring to migrants crossing into the state across the border with Mexico. But what about the other ways people enter the state? Joseph Hayes, a research associate at the Public Policy Institute of California, pointed out that border arrests aren’t necessarily the best metric to evaluate migration to California. Much of the nation’s and state’s undocumented population results from individuals overstaying visas. In a 2017 report, the Center For Migration Studies found that two-thirds of those who arrived in the United States in 2014 and later would be counted as undocumented were admitted on temporary visas "and then overstayed their period of admission or otherwise violated the terms of their visas." Still, Hayes said, the overall number of people living illegally in California has declined since before the Great Recession. The state was home to approximately 3 million undocumented residents in 2007, a figure that’s dropped to as low as 2.35 million, according to estimates reviewed by PPIC. The decline in the state’s undocumented population reinforces Brown’s contention there’s "no massive wave of migrants pouring into California." Historically, Meade added, thousands of seasonal migrant farmworkers have come to California through the border with Mexico. He said that seasonal migration has largely "dried up" in recent years and many undocumented farmworkers now stay in the state year-round, rather than crossing back into Mexico. "International migration has become more difficult," he said, citing greater border enforcement. 2018 spike in crossings Brown cited figures from 2017. But what about the 200 percent spike in apprehensions borderwide in March 2018 compared with the same month a year ago, as cited this week by Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen? Meade, of the Trans Border Institute, said the 2018 increase should be considered in context. It follows the historically low number of 2017 arrests, which has been attributed, in part, to fewer people trying to illegally cross the border due to Trump’s election and hard-line immigration stance. Immigration experts have also cited the Obama administration’s aggressive deportation efforts and greater economic opportunities in Mexico for recent declines in border crossings. Meade also noted the 2018 increase took place during spring, the high-point of migration season. He said it doesn’t represent a long-term trend. Nor does it show California is experiencing a disproportionate share of the 2018 increase, he said. "Unless this were to continue for months and months and months and break the seasonal pattern, I don’t think there’s any real way to claim (the early part of 2018) is a crisis." Our ruling Gov. Jerry Brown claimed in a recent letter to the Trump administration: "there is no massive wave of migrants pouring into California. Overall immigrant apprehensions on the border last year were as low as they’ve been in nearly 50 years (and 85 percent of the apprehensions occurred outside of California)." U.S. Border Patrol data show Brown got his arrest figures right. Researchers point out that illegal border crossings account for only one portion of the migrants that arrive in California. Others come to the state legally on visas which they later overstay. But given the context of Brown’s letter, it’s clear the governor was referring to the lack of a wave of migrants coming illegally across the Southern border. That part of the claim is also backed up by the border patrol data and two immigration experts. We rate Brown’s claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

pomt-15247	Caution: Kissing and cuddling chickens can be hazardous to your health.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/aug/04/centers-disease-control/cdc-kissing-and-cuddling-backyard-chickens-linked-/	Raising backyard chickens has been satisfying some foodies’ affection for the uber-local egg and lower-fat meat in urban areas, including metro Atlanta, for about a decade. Now the Centers for Disease Control is warning of a downside to the popular trend: salmonella outbreaks traced to some backyard owners kissing and cuddling their flocks. The CDC findings drew some media attention last month, and a PolitiFact reader who heard the health alert on NPR’s "Morning Edition" on July 16 asked us to dig deeper. We went directly to the source, the CDC, which is headquartered in Atlanta and has been investigating four recent Salmonella outbreaks that, as of July 29, had infected 218 people in 41 states. Five of them were in Georgia, 19 were in Alabama, 5 were in North Carolina, 11 were in South Carolina and 6 were in Tennessee. Fifty of the 218 people have required hospitalization for Salmonella, the major symptoms of which are usually diarrhea, fever and abdominal pain. No deaths have been reported, CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund said. So how exactly do CDC officials know that some of these cases are due to backyard breeders kissing and cuddling live poultry? Dr. Megin Nichols, a veterinarian with the CDC, told PolitiFact the agency has been tracking upward trends in both the number of outbreaks and people infected in the past five years and has been working to trace their causes. "We’ve been trying to interview these people to find out how they are getting sick," Nichols said. "We are finding a certain proportion that are due to very close contact -- something that surprised us here at the CDC." Salmonella is a germ that lives naturally in the intestine of chickens, ducks and many other animals. It doesn’t typically make the birds sick, but they can transmit the germs in their droppings and on their feet, feathers and beaks, even when they look clean and healthy, the CDC says. The germs also can get on their cages, coops, feed, water dishes, hay, plants and the area where they live and roam. In addition, the bacteria can rest on the hands, shoes and clothes of those who work around the birds or play with them. And Nichols told us that among the people who became ill between 2008 and 2014 due to baby poultry exposure, 49 percent, or 196 out of 400, reported snuggling and holding baby birds. Another 13 percent, or about 53, reported kissing baby birds, she said. Those people, many of whom were young children, became sick through fecal oral contact, Nichols said. Those same interviews also showed that about 46 percent of backyard breeders are keeping live poultry in their homes, she said. Epidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback findings have linked the most recent four outbreaks of human Salmonella infections to contact with chicks, ducklings, and other live poultry from multiple hatcheries. Interviews have been conducted with 140 of those who were recently ill and, 117, or 84 percent, reported contact with live poultry in the week before their illness began, according to the CDC website. Additional interviews to determine whether that contact included snuggling and kissing have yet to be conducted, Nichols said. An increasing number of people around the country are choosing to keep live poultry - mostly chickens, ducks, turkeys and geese as part of a greener, healthier lifestyle. Local governments, including several in metro Atlanta, have changed their zoning ordinances in recent years to accommodate the trend, and groups of backyard poultry buffs meet regularly in the region to talk chicken. Backyard owners have told reporters at The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the benefits include fresh eggs and meat, a built-in source of fertilizer for their gardens and ready-made bug-killers. Some say they give their chickens names, the freedom to roam the house and yard and cuddle and coddle them like family pets. The larger problem According to the CDC, salmonella, named for an American scientist who discovered the bacteria, is estimated to cause a million illnesses in the United States a year, with 19,000 hospitalizations and 380 deaths. Most people develop diarrhea and the other conditions within 12 to 72 hour after infection and recover without treatment in four to seven days. It has the potential to turn deadly if it spreads from the intestines to the bloodstream, and then to other body sites. Prompt treatment with antibiotics is critical, and the elderly, infants, and people with impaired immune systems are more likely to have a severe illness. In the largest recent outbreak, which occurred between March 2013 and July 2014, more than 600 people in 29 states and Puerto Rico were infected with seven outbreak strains. The outbreak was associated with one brand of chicken, which led to a company recall of more than 40,000 pounds of chicken products, according to the CDC. To prevent salmonella infections related to backyard farming, the CDC’s Nichols encourages several common-sense rules. These include thorough handwashing after contact with the chicken, keeping live poultry out of the home, and avoiding snuggling, close contact with the birds’ beaks or other close exposure that would allow ingestion of bacteria. She will be one of the experts featured in a webinar on the topic of practicing backyard bird biosecurity at 7p.m. Thursday. Our conclusion The CDC has issued a warning against kissing or snuggling backyard chickens. It follows four recent Salmonella outbreaks that, as of July 29, had infected 218 people in 41 states. Five of them were in Georgia. Interviews have been conducted with 140 of the ill and 117, or 84 percent, reported contact with live poultry in the week before their illness began, according to the CDC website. The CDC also has evidence from outbreaks between 2008 to 2014. In that period, they found that of the people who became infected with salmonella due to baby poultry exposure, 49 percent, or 196 out of 400 people, reported snuggling and holding baby birds. Another 13 percent, or about 53, reported kissing baby birds.. That’s cause to sound the alarm. We rate the CDC warning True.

pomt-09542	Some Republicans who voted against the stimulus "have been all too happy to claim credit for Recovery Act projects and the jobs those projects have produced. They come to the ribbon cuttings."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/05/barack-obama/obama-criticizes-republicans-who-opposed-stimulus-/	Twice recently, President Barack Obama has slammed congressional Republicans for voting against his economic stimulus bill in February 2009 but later touting provisions of the bill that benefited their own constituents. During his Jan. 29, 2010, question-and-answer session with House Republican lawmakers in Baltimore, Obama brought up the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, as the stimulus is officially known: "There was an interesting headline in CNN today: 'Americans disapprove of stimulus, but like every policy in it.' And there was a poll that showed that if you broke it down into its component parts, 80 percent approved of the tax cuts, 80 percent approved of the infrastructure, 80 percent approved of the assistance to the unemployed. Well, that's what the Recovery Act was. And let's face it, some of you have been at the ribbon-cuttings for some of these important projects in your communities." Then, on Feb. 2, 2010, Obama riffed on the same theme during a town hall event in New Hampshire: "I have to point out, though, that some of the very same folks in Congress who opposed the Recovery Act -- and claim that it hasn’t worked -- have been all too happy to claim credit for Recovery Act projects and the jobs those projects have produced. (Applause.) They come to the ribbon-cuttings and ... (laughter). They found a way to have their cake and vote against it, too. (Laughter.)" We decided that a claim that bold, repeated in two high-profile events within a week's time, was worth a fact-check. As it turns out, we found several cases in which lawmakers voted against the measure but later claimed credit for provisions or projects stemming from the stimulus bill. -- Rep. Don Young of Alaska. Young, who has served in Congress since 1973, sent out two press releases on Feb. 13, 2009, the day the House passed the final version of the stimulus bill. One was headlined, "Rep. Young Votes NO On Democrats’ Massive Spending Bill." It quotes Young saying, "This bill was not a stimulus bill, it was a vehicle for pet projects, and that’s wrong." Young's second release of the day was headlined, "Rep. Young Wins Victory For Alaska Small Business." It explains how Young, after lobbying by the Alaska Federation of Natives, targeted a provision from the stimulus bill that would have required competitive bidding for stimulus grants and contracts. The Alaska Natives group said the provision could have hurt its members' ability to benefit from Small Business Administration programs. Young, the release said, "worked with Members on the other side of the aisle to make the case for these programs, and was able to get the provision pulled from the bill." In the release, Young said that “no matter if I supported this bill or not, I would make sure [Alaska Natives] were not hurt by it." -- Rep. Geoff Davis of Kentucky. Davis, a three-term congressman, issued a news release on Jan. 28, 2009, the day of the first House vote on the stimulus, in which he was quoted saying that "this so-called ‘stimulus’ legislation is full of pet spending projects that will do very little to restore confidence in our economy or create jobs." But 11 months later, on Dec. 16, 2009, Davis sent out a release announcing the awarding of a $1 million-plus grant for the Carroll County School District. "Congressman Geoff Davis is pleased to announce that the Carroll County School District has been awarded $1,044,140 in funding through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) Early Head Start Expansion Program," the release stated. It goes on to say, "In these difficult economic times, it is critical to ensure that vulnerable populations in Kentucky have access to important support services like those provided by the Early Head Start program. This important grant will allow Carroll County School District to expand their ability to provide needed assistance to local low-income families and children. I am very proud of the work that the Carroll County School District is doing to strengthen their community, and I am pleased that our office was able to assist them in obtaining these funds.” As it happened, on the very same day, Davis sent out a separate release in which he referred to the "failed trillion-dollar 'stimulus' bill." -- Rep. Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania. Shuster, elected in 2001, is a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. During the stimulus debate, he advocated for targeting the measure more directly toward infrastructure spending. A Jan. 28, 2009, news release from his office said that "President Obama told the American people that he would stimulate our economy by rejuvenating our infrastructure. As a longtime advocate of improving our nation’s infrastructure, Shuster was encouraged by this announcement. Unfortunately, the Democrats in Congress, led by Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi, squandered this historic opportunity to create jobs and strengthen the backbone of our economy in order to fund 40 years of pent-up liberal pet projects." In November, the Blairsville (Pa.) Dispatch reported that Shuster attended a ceremonial groundbreaking for a new facility at a sewage treatment plant in Blairsville. According to the newspaper, the $12.1 million project was funded in part by federal stimulus money. -- Rep. Phil Gingrey of Georgia. In a Feb. 13, 2009, news release, Gingrey, a four-term congressman, explained his vote by saying that "this ‘stimulus’ bill only perpetuates the dangerous myth that government spending will fix this economy. ... The truth is government spending will only bury future generations in more debt." In October, a photograph in the Cedartown (Ga.) Standard showed Gingrey handing over a giant, ceremonial check for $625,000 in stimulus money to municipal leaders. The money was to pay for "new sidewalks, landscaping and other improvements to the downtown area," according to the newspaper. A Gingrey spokeswoman told the Standard that because the project qualified for federal stimulus funds as "shovel-ready," Gingrey "presented the proposal at the federal level." City commissioner Scott Tillery described Gingrey to the newspaper as "our point man when we need action from the federal government. His staff is always interested and involved in local concerns, and the congressman will use his influence to make a case for his constituents." -- Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina. Burr voted against the stimulus yet appeared in person to present a $2 million-plus stimulus grant to help build a fire station to house the Bethlehem Community Volunteer Fire Department. "This is a great thing for this county," Burr said, according to the Hickory (N.C.) Daily Record. "We're not accustomed to federal dollars in that magnitude finding their way to North Carolina." A spokesman for Burr told the Associated Press in October that he wasn't taking credit for the money. "Sen. Burr was invited to the grant presentation by the Alexander County commissioners and was happy to be there to recognize the community and the fire department for their work in securing this highly competitive grant,'' the spokesman said. In an interview with Politico, Burr added, “Just because I voted against the stimulus doesn’t mean I shouldn’t recognize the merit achievement of an entity.” None of the four House members cited above responded to a query from PolitiFact. But the spokesman for one senior Republican lawmaker -- House Minority Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia -- did return our call. He argued that the Democratic criticism is overblown. Cantor, a leading stimulus opponent, has taken heat from Democrats for organizing a job fair whose participating employers benefited from stimulus funding, as well as for helping local officials lobby for stimulus money to support a high-speed rail link between Washington, D.C., and Richmond, Va. Brad Dayspring, Cantor's spokesman, defended both efforts, saying that, in the first case, the congressman was simply trying to help his unemployed constituents get back to work, and, in the second case, he was continuing his longstanding efforts to boost high-speed rail. Cantor's advocacy on the rail issue dates back a decade, to his tenure in the Virginia legislature. On the broader question of why Cantor opted not to support the bill, Dayspring said that the congressman made his decision based on his opposition to the vast majority of the bill's provisions. "The bill was so flawed, he voted against it despite his overwhelming support" for the rail provision, Dayspring said. "If you support 1 percent of a bill and oppose 99 percent, are you expected to vote for it?" Let's return to Obama's claim. The president said that Republicans who voted against the stimulus "have been all too happy to claim credit for Recovery Act projects and the jobs those projects have produced." We found at least two lawmakers -- Young and Davis -- who aggressively criticized the stimulus bill yet sent out a news release touting their own role in helping constituents benefit from the bill. In the meantime, Obama also said that some opponents of the stimulus have "come to the ribbon cuttings" for projects funded by the bill. Shuster, Gingrey and Burr clearly attended such ceremonies. To us, five clear cases are enough to validate the president's assertion that some stimulus opponents have "found a way to have their cake and vote against it, too." We rate Obama's statement True.

pomt-06998	By the end of his first term, President Obama will have added as much debt as all the prior 43 presidents combined.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/10/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-barack-obama-will-add-more-debt-4/	At a roundtable of small business leaders in Salem, N.H., former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney was asked what he would do about the corporate tax rate, whether he would cut government spending or raise taxes and whether it was possible to do both. Romney said he had a plan to lower the corporate tax rate but noted the nation's huge debt. "What I would like to do is bring the tax rate down and eliminate some of the special breaks that go to the big businesses that have found ways to take advantage of loopholes," Romney said. "So, I’d take that corporate tax rate down at least from 35 down to 25 percent. Then we can talk about where we can go from there. I’d like to get it a lot lower, but what I don’t want to do is add to the deficit. I don’t want to come back with a tax rate so low that we end up seeing our deficit go shooting up, because what we don’t want to have happen is the circumstance where we have larger and larger deficits. "I mean, this president is on track to have added so much debt to this country, that by the end of his first term, he will have added as much debt as all the prior presidents of this country combined. Think of that. I don’t want to do what he’s done, but I do believe we need to bring the corporate tax rate down, close special deals and loopholes to help finance that and encourage investment and growth by virtue of doing so." Really? More debt than all 43 presidents before President Obama? First we had to determine which "debt" Romney was referring to in his statement. There are actually two main ways of tabulating the debt. One is public debt, which includes all debt borrowed by the federal government and held by investors through Treasury notes and other securities. The other is gross federal debt, which includes public debt plus debt held by the government. The most notable forms of debt held by the government are the trust funds for Social Security and Medicare, money which is owed to beneficiaries in the future. Romney spokesman Ryan Williams said the candidate was referring to debt held by the public. We then needed to determine the start and end points for calculating how much of the debt can be categorized as falling within Obama’s first term. Obama took office on January 20, 2009, but who "owns" the debt recorded for fiscal year 2009 is unclear. Obama signed off on the budget that year, but it was assembled during Bush’s term, and it does not really bear Obama’s imprint. Similarly, it’s possible to say that either the fiscal year 2012 budget or the fiscal year 2013 budget is Obama’s last from his first term. So we decided to analyze Romney’s claim by using three possible date ranges for our calculations. -- October 1, 2008 (the start of fiscal 2009) to Oct. 1, 2012 (the end of fiscal 2012) -- January 20, 2009 (the day of Obama’s inauguration) to Oct. 1, 2013 (the end of fiscal 2013) -- October 1, 2009 (the start of fiscal 2010, Obama's first full budget year) to Oct. 1, 2013 (the end of fiscal 2013) We’re offering several options because each of these measurements have shortcomings for the purpose of measuring the debt accumulated under Obama. We’re able to calculate the debt figures for the earlier dates using the U.S. Department of Treasury’s "Debt to the Penny" calculator. The future debt amounts come from Office of Management and Budget projections. Because they are projections, they’re subject to change as economic circumstances change, but they are are widely cited among experts. (OMB doesn’t project future debt to specific dates, only to the end of future fiscal years, so that’s why our ending dates are only at the end of fiscal years.) Here are the debt totals accumulated during the three periods we listed above: * End of fiscal year 2008, when the accrued debt under the 43 presidents was $5.851 trillion, to the end of fiscal 2012, when the debt is projected to reach $11.881 trillion. Yes, more than the previous 43 presidents. * Obama inauguration, when the accrued debt was $6.307 trillion, to the end of fiscal year 2013, when the debt is projected to reach $12.784 trillion. Yes, more than the previous 43 presidents. * End of fiscal year 2009, when the accrued debt was $7.506 trillion, to end of fiscal year 2013, when the debt is projected to reach $12.784 trillion. No, not as much as the previous 43 presidents. Over the first two scenarios above, the debt more than doubled from the starting point (which reflects the debt under the prior 43 presidents) to the ending point. So in these two scenarios, Romney is right -- Obama accumulated more debt than the previous 43 presidents combined. But for the third scenario, the debt didn't double, so Romney would be wrong. This exercise is a testament to the fact that small changes in assumptions can produce big differences in outcomes. Of course, there’s no guarantee that Obama’s administration will actually preside over as much publicly held debt as predicted, since new budgets and projections will change debt outcomes every year. And the current negotiations over raising the debt ceiling could significantly change the forecasts. Still, this is what we can conclude given the data when Romney made his statement. Now let’s throw in a further complication. In an interview, Romney’s staff backed up the candidate’s statement in part by citing a prior ruling by PolitiFact. Williams, Romney’s spokesman, cited PolitiFact "True" ruling on a claim by Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va. In a letter to the editor of the Richmond Times-Dispatch in October 2010, Cantor wrote that "the budget submitted by Obama will add more to the debt than the outstanding debt of the previous 43 presidents combined." PolitiFact rated the statement True, and that was good enough for Romney’s campaign. "We actually pulled it right off the (Politifact) website," Williams said in an interview. "We’re making the same contention that (Cantor) made." But when the topic came up in Romney's claim, we re-checked our work and realized that in the Cantor fact-check we had only used the first option (the end of fiscal 2008 to the end of fiscal 2012) rather than the other two. Based on all three measurements, Romney is right by two but off by the other one. So we find his claim Mostly True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2011-07-10T06:00:00	2011-06-27	['Barack_Obama']

Coquille Tribal Chief Ken Tanner told a reporter that the tribe has the right to build a second casino. "The idea of one casino per tribe is a false one. Evidence of that is that the governor signed our compact which allows us a second casino," he said in a radio report that aired April 24, 2013, on Oregon Public Broadcasting. Tanner’s claim was news to PolitiFact Oregon. Is the "one casino per tribe" idea a false one, not grounded in reality? We always thought the policy was the norm in Oregon. Federal law calls for a tribe and state to negotiate a compact agreement before a casino can be sited. The compact spells out location, security and size. There is no federal or state law that limits tribes to one casino each. It is a policy of Gov. John Kitzhaber, who served two four-year terms from 1995 to 2003 and was elected to a third term that began in 2011. Gov. Ted Kulongoski, who served in-between, also adhered to this policy. Each of Oregon’s nine federally recognized tribes has a current compact with the state that identifies one casino location: The Grand Ronde has Spirit Mountain Casinoand the Siletz has Chinook Winds Casino. The Warm Springs opened Indian Head Casino in 2012, and in doing so, closed its casino at Kah-Nee-Ta Resort and Spa. Coquille We spoke with Ray Doering, spokesman for the Coquille Economic Development Corporation, which operates the Mill Casino in North Bend. (Tanner later followed up with an e-mail to PolitiFact Oregon, saying that he stood by his statement.) Doering made two points: One, the proposed venture is a different type of casino, one that does not need to go through the compact process. Two, he said, the tribe never agreed to Kitzhaber’s policy, even if it signed a compact in 2000 for the Mill Casino. Doering said it doesn’t matter what other tribes say they agreed to because the Coquille did not. "There was no agreement to keep it at one facility. What it says in this contract, we agreed to not seek an additional compact for a period of five years and that (provision) ended eight years ago," Doering said. Indeed, the 52-page agreement signed in 2000 specifies that the Coquille waives any right for a period of five years to even think about negotiating an agreement for another casino unless another tribe is allowed to operate more than one casino. Doering points to the compact language as evidence that the tribe could negotiate for a second casino after five years. Kitzhaber’s legal counsel says the language does not entitle the tribe to a second casino. The Burns Paiute, Klamath, Siletz and Umatilla tribes have similar five-year language in their compacts, said a spokesman for the governor. The compacts for Cow Creek, Warm Springs and Grand Ronde are more explicit, and the tribes waive any rights they may have to pursue a second casino, regardless of time frame. Governor, others The Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians, which operates the Seven Feathers Casino Resort in Canyonville, is at risk of losing money to a 600-machine casino in Medford and opposes the proposed second casino. Cow Creek leaders say Kitzhaber’s one casino, one tribe policy was agreed to by Oregon’s tribes and preserves the balance of casino gambling in the state. "We see it as an agreement made in good faith. The governor’s office calls it a policy; we would call it an agreement," said Susan Ferris, spokeswoman for Cow Creek. There’s another aspect we need to address: Types of casinos. The governor has authority to negotiate compacts for the large-scale tribal casinos currently in Oregon, called Class III. He has no authority over Class II casinos, which the National Indian Gaming Commission defines as casinos offering bingo and "when played in the same location as bingo - pull tabs, lotto, punch boards, tip jars, instant bingo, other games similar to bingo." The proposed casino would fall into this category. The ruling: Tanner is correct that the idea of one casino per tribe is a malleable one. This is Kitzhaber’s policy, and one that might fail in a legal challenge. Also, a future governor could decide on no limits at all. And the governor has no authority over any proliferation of bingo-oriented casinos. But it’s not entirely accurate to say that the idea of one casino per tribe is "a false one," or that the idea is non-existent. Kitzhaber, in a letter this week urging the Bureau of Indian Affairs to reject the Coquille proposal, wrote, "My ‘one casino per tribe’ policy direction and the gaming compacts entered into between the State and the tribes provide support for the notion that, as a State, we have consistently attempted to strike a balance between tribal pursuit of economic enterprise and a check on the expansion of gambling in our State." In the eyes of Coquille leaders, the policy does not apply because they did not agree to it. But a policy does exist, in the governor’s stated words and in the compacts of other tribes in Oregon. The Warm Springs closed one casino in order to open another. The Cow Creek believe it to be an agreement made by the tribes. The statement is Half True -- partially accurate but missing important details.	None	Ken Tanner	None	None	None	2013-05-09T03:00:00	2013-04-24	['None']
pomt-14042	"The Nordic countries are some of the few countries" that meet development aid goals.	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/may/26/barack-obama/us-v-nordic-block-how-they-compare-foreign-aid/	President Barack Obama recently hosted a meeting with the leaders of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Iceland. The president had nothing but good things to say about his visitors from the Nordic block, remarking that, "There have been times where I’ve said, ‘Why don’t we just put all these small countries in charge for a while, and they could clean things up.’ " Small but potent was a recurring theme. "They are, individually, not large countries in terms of population, but in terms of effectiveness, contributions, ideas, energy, they are enormously important players on the international stage," Obama said as they wrapped up their meeting on May 13, 2016. "The Nordic countries are some of the few countries -- and, by the way, the United States doesn’t fall into this category -- of meeting the goals that had been set with respect to foreign aid and humanitarian assistance." Obama was specifically thinking about a United Nations benchmark that says that 0.7 percent of a country’s Gross National Income should go to official development assistance. It’s an aspirational target that dates back to 1970 and is entirely voluntary. (Gross National Income is a slightly less common way to measure the size of country’s economy.) The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development keeps track of that spending. The money has to go to developing countries and military aid doesn’t count. Since about 1980, four countries have met or shot well beyond the 0.7 percent mark. They are Sweden, Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands. You will notice that Finland and Iceland are missing from that group. Finland has come close, approaching 0.6 percent since 2010, and once -- in 1991 -- hitting 0.8 percent. But that’s not 0.7 percent. Iceland’s high-water mark was .47 in 2008, but its banks bet heavily on risky housing securities and the nation’s economy crashed hard in the Great Recession. Today, it puts .24 percent toward foreign development aid. Here’s how the 29 member countries of the OECD Development Assistance Committee stack up. (The United States is listed in orange; Nordic countries are in blue.) The United States is in the middle of the pack with 0.17 percent of GNI. That is just one way of measuring aid, however. The American economy is huge, so in terms of raw dollars, its spending stands way above all others. In 2015, the total was nearly $31 billion, or about a fifth of all the development aid tracked by the OECD. Of note: Great Britain and Luxembourg have been doing a good job of hitting the 0.7 percent target. In a purely technical sense and for just a couple of years, so has the United Arab Emirates. In 2014 and 2015, it gave more than 1 percent of its GNI in aid. But virtually all of that went to Egypt to support the military after it toppled the government led by parties aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood. Our ruling Obama said that the Nordic countries are among the few that have met foreign development aid goals. He was referring to the voluntary target of 0.7 percent of Gross National Income that wealthier nations agreed to in 1970. For the largest Nordic nations of Denmark, Sweden and Norway, Obama is correct. All of them have met or exceeded the 0.7 percent mark for many years. But if you put Finland and Iceland into the mix, the statement’s accuracy slips. Finland is close but not quite at the mark, and Iceland lies further from it. We’ll say the statement is three-fifths correct. That rates Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6a084bb1-9be1-41b7-b78f-a97ec48df5a3	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2016-05-26T16:27:29	2016-05-13	['None']
pomt-10356	"If you have an investment for your child's education or own a mutual fund or a stock in a retirement plan, (Obama) is going to raise your taxes."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/09/john-mccain/mccains-argument-tangential-at-best/	As political attacks go, this one is about as well-worn as they get. I, the Republican, will cut your taxes. He, the Democrat, will raise your taxes. Such was the gist of a speech Sen. John McCain made in a town hall meeting in Denver on July 7. "If you have an investment for your child's education or own a mutual fund or a stock in a retirement plan, he (Obama) is going to raise your taxes." This statement is based on Obama's plan to raise the long-term capital gains tax from the current rate of 15 percent to as high as 28 percent (Obama has not been specific about the rate he'll seek). It's part of Obama's strategy to shift more of the tax burden to wealthy people. But according to the McCain campaign, Obama's plan would hit the middle class. What's interesting about McCain's statement is that it's so specific; retirement plans, investments for education. For most people, those investments are made in tax sheltered plans, such as 401Ks or 529 plans for college funds. The McCain explanation is that Obama's tax plan would have a broad effect on investing, essentially taxing everything. "Obama has pledged to raise capital taxes - on capital gains and dividends - potentially impacting tens of millions of Americans," said Brian Rogers, a spokesman for the McCain campaign. "All investors would face the impact of higher capital taxes on the valuation of their investments. While those in non-tax preferred accounts may not immediately be affected by capital gains and dividend tax hikes, funds ultimately withdrawn from tax-deferred accounts are subject to taxation as ordinary income -- on which Senator Obama has also pledged to raise the top marginal rate." To support the argument, the McCain campaign points to some statistics: That 52% of American adults own stocks, and that in 2006, 8.5 million of them paid a capital gains tax. McCain's campaign also notes an Investment Company Institute survey that concluded 88 million people invested in the stock market through mutual funds. Lastly, they point to a report from the Joint Committee On Taxation that found in 2005, about 20 percent of the taxpayers who were expected to report capital gains income - and 24 percent of those expected to report dividend income - earned less than $50,000 annually. These statistics ignore a very important caveat Obama has included in his tax plan, his unequivocal pledge that he will not raise capital gains taxes (or any other taxes) for families making less than $250,000 a year. "A lot of what (McCain campaign people) are saying is noise," said Eric Toder, a tax policy expert with the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute in Washington, D.C. Those statistics on the large percentages of Americans who hold stocks and pay capital gains taxes are accurate, Toder said, they just aren't relevant to the argument. Yes, he said, there are 88 million people who have invested money in the stock market but "not too many of them are making $250,000 a year." So the higher rates in Obama's plan wouldn't apply to them. "I would say this stuff is, at best, misleading," Toder said. Toder also said that if McCain is talking about traditional college savings plans, like a 529, then he's "just wrong." The Obama campaign argues that not only is McCain wrong, they say that Obama is proposing some tax relief on those very fronts. Obama's plan calls for a fully refundable $4,000 college tax credit; and a 50% match of the first $1,000 of retirement savings you do each year. There is another school of thought on this issue, in support of the McCain campaign's argument, that raising capital gains and dividend tax rates will harm the value of stocks in general, and discourage investing in the long term. That may not translate to a direct tax on an individual, said Patrick Fleenor, chief economist for the Tax Foundation, a business-backed tax policy group, but the effect is the same. Any stock portfolio, whether it's earmarked for a child's education expenses or retirement, or anything, is going to suffer, he said. "The underlying value of the fund would be lower," Fleenor said. "To economists, there's no difference." Even if you agree with this argument, that's not what McCain said. He said if you have an investment for your child's education, or own a mutual fund or stock in a retirement plan "he (Obama) is going to raise your taxes." The fact is the capital gains tax would have absolutely no direct effect on savings in a traditional college savings plan. As for retirement savings through stocks or a mutual funds, people who cash out would not face higher tax rates unless you make more than $250,000. That doesn't apply to most Americans. We rate McCain's statement False.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-07-09T00:00:00	2008-07-07	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-08752	"(I) helped to invent a system that saved over a billion dollars on welfare."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/aug/29/kenneth-block/block-says-system-he-helped-create-detect-welfare-/	In a television commercial, Kenneth Block, the Moderate Party candidate for governor, tries to appeal to voters by suggesting that he is business savvy, concerned about the environment, and knows how to save taxpayer money. "I built a successful high-tech business, created green jobs, and helped to invent a system that saved over a billion dollars on welfare," he says in the commercial, which is also available on his website. We decided to focus on the welfare claim and the savings Block says he helped to generate. First, Block isn't talking about Rhode Island. He said he is talking about software he helped develop for Texas, which in 1995 adopted a statewide debit card system for food stamp and welfare recipients. It computerized every transaction, eliminating, for example, the need for paper food stamps, which can be stolen or misused. He's been more specific on his website blog: "As a small business owner, Ken helped to invent a system that saved Texas over a billion dollars on welfare. He did this by eliminating waste and fraud in the system . . . " Second, the $1 billion savings estimate comes from food stamps, not from welfare, which people often lump together because both are forms of public assistance. Block's campaign encouraged us to focus on the food stamp program because, they said, it would be easier to quantify the savings. How did Block's efforts help save this money? He said one technique is "data mining," in which large amounts of information are analyzed to look for improprieties, such as a small grocery that reports the food sales numbers of a huge supermarket. He said sham storefronts were paying food stamp recipients 50 cents on the dollar for their stamps and then billing the state for the full amount when no food was actually sold. Such information helped direct investigators to crooked vendors and recipients, he said. So there are two key questions: Did Block help create the fraud detection system and did it save $1 billion? Geoffrey Wool, a spokesman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, said Block was an employee of GTECH when Texas contracted with the Rhode Island gambling company in the early 1990s to develop the EBT system. Wool said the Texas commission currently gets services from Simpatico Software Systems, the company Block started after he left GTECH. Block also referred us to Curtis Ermer, one of his GTECH colleagues on the EBT project. "Ken's role was large in terms of the design. Ken could sit down in a short period of time and optimize that code," said Ermer, who has since left GTECH. He said an anti-fraud component "was a purpose of the whole EBT system. The counterfeiting of stamps, the multiple addresses people would use, was supposed to be reduced." Thus, it appears Block played a significant role in establishing the EBT system, so his "helped to invent" claim is True. What about the second key question: Did that system save more than $1 billion? We were unable to locate any official report showing how much waste or fraud was eliminated by adoption of the EBT program. Block's campaign then directed us to several news reports from 1998 suggesting that the savings were large, although they widely disagreed on the amount saved: * In an opinion piece in The Houston Chronicle, Joe Williams, president of the Gulf Coast Retailers Association, said the number of Texas households receiving food stamps and welfare benefits plummeted from 1.4 million in 1994 to 850,000 in 1998 due to the EBT card system, saving taxpayers more than $1.2 billion a year. * A Dallas Morning News story quoted then-Texas Comptroller John Sharp as saying there had been a 250,000-person decline in food stamp rolls. At the time, a typical recipient was receiving about $70 in food stamps per month, according to a federal report we located independently. That would translate to a savings of $206 million per year. *A San Antonio Express-News story quoted Sharp's office as reporting that the decline in food stamp enrollment saved $67.3 million a month. That would total more than $800 million in just one year. The Block campaign also directed us to a March 1996 state newsletter, quoting Sharp as saying that when EBT went on-line in Houston in February 1995, 30,000 recipients immediately dropped off the food stamp rolls, including some who had been receiving food stamps at two or three different addresses. It also reported that "between January and October 1995, Texas' food stamp rolls shrank by nearly 200,000 recipients." At $70 per month per person, the statewide savings would surpass $1 billion after six years and one month -- sooner if you factor in inflation. All of this suggests that the EBT system indeed saved a lot of money in Texas. But there were some dissenting voices. We talked to Celia Hagert, a senior policy analyst for the Center for Public Policy Priorities, an Austin-based nonprofit think tank devoted to improving the economic and social conditions of low- and moderate-income Texans. She agreed that the card system eliminated fraud on the part of retailers, but said enrollment was declining before the card system went into effect and "there weren't hordes and hordes of people fraudulently receiving food stamps." And two officials at the Texas Health and Human Services Commission insisted that GTECH, Block and his company have had no direct role in fraud detection. "There is no fraud detection mechanism in the product GTECH delivered," said Wool, the commission's spokesman. Instead, Wool said, the system simply sends data to Texas' Office of Inspector General, which developed its own fraud detection software. Block responded by showing us two emails from Douglas B. Walker, of Austin, who was a system analyst for the Texas Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) system, retiring in 2007. The messages asked Block to look into some cases of suspected fraud. So we asked Wool to put us in touch with someone higher. He arranged an interview with Michael Garbarino, director of policy and outreach affairs for the inspector general's office, who expressed surprise at the Walker emails, saying he had talked to others to confirm that making such checks was not an assigned function. "None of these contracts, none of the vendors, nor any of the subcontractors ever had within the scope of the contract fraud detection responsibilities," he said. "The automation that runs that data through algorithms to arrive at questionable transactions was entirely created by state staff and never was in the scope of any vendor contract." In the end, Block did help develop the EBT system and the system likely saved -- directly or indirectly -- more than $1 billion in waste and fraud since its implementation 15 years ago. We rate his claim as True. The candidate, in interviews and on his blog, insists that he played a key role in fraud detection. He maintains that he continues helping with that task today. But Block is now aware, through our contacts with his office, that two Texas officials consistently and adamantly dispute that.

pomt-02860	"Under President (George W.) Bush, prosecution of gun crimes was 30 percent higher than it is under President Obama."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/15/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-gun-prosecutions-down-under-obama/	After leading the charge for a government shutdown to defund President Barack Obama’s health care law, freshman Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, hasn’t shied away from the spotlight. On Nov. 8, 2013, Cruz was a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Long before he got to the obligatory joke about reading Green Eggs & Ham during a lengthy Senate speech, he addressed gun policy. "Do you target violent criminals, or do you try to take away the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens?" Cruz said. After the senator criticized Obama for focusing on the latter at the expense of the former, he praised predecessor George W. Bush’s efforts. "Under President Bush, prosecution of gun crimes was 30 percent higher than it is under President Obama," Cruz said. "They’re not targeting bad guys." We decided to see how the numbers differed under the two presidents. Ways to read the data Let’s break down the number of federal prosecutions by year. We’ll start with fiscal year 2002, since that represents Bush’s first full year in office. Fiscal year 2012 is the most recent year we have data for. There are two different sets of statistics we can look at. Cruz’s spokeswoman referred us to the Transitional Records Access Clearinghouse, a Syracuse University data-gathering organization. This data tracks federal gun prosecutions by the lead, or most serious, charge. On the other hand, the Department of Justice’s United States Attorney’s Office tracks all charges, a more inclusive category of prosecutions. Their data set includes everyone who was charged with a gun crime. The lead charge category only includes people whose most serious offense was gun-related, a distinction that omits thousands of charges each year. Lead charges All charges 2002 7,948 10,634 2003 10,432 13,037 2004 11,015 12,962 2005 10,219 13,062 2006 9,652 12,479 2007 8,919 12,087 2008 8,484 11,974 2009 8,188 11,722 2010 7,614 11,421 2011 7,465 11,811 2012 7,774 11,728 Cruz’s spokeswoman also told us that Cruz’s claim didn’t take into account numbers for Bush’s entire term: He used 2004, the high-water mark for lead gun prosecutions during the time period, as his starting point. We’re left with four ways to calculate the percent change: • Lead charges from 2002 to 2012, which gives us a 2.2 percent decrease • Lead charges from 2004 to 2012, which gives us a 29.4 percent decrease • All charges from 2002 to 2012, which gives us a 10.3 percent increase • All charges from 2005 (the high-water mark of this data set) to 2012, which gives us a 10.2 percent decrease This makes clear how Cruz got his 30 percent decrease. However, that’s not the only, or necessarily the best, approach. None other than TRAC’s co-director, Susan Long, told PolitiFact that her organization’s use of lead charges isn’t as comprehensive as using all charges. She also called Cruz’s 2004 start date misleading, since it amounts to cherry-picking. The most reliable number may be the 10.3 percent increase in gun prosecutions between fiscal years 2002 and 2012. This rate actually indicates the trend moving in the opposite direction from what Cruz asserted. Who’s responsible? In addition to highlighting a numerical difference in federal gun crime prosecutions, Cruz specifically suggested that Obama’s policies are responsible for the decrease. But how much influence does the president really have on the issue? Experts say: not much. "The Bush administration was all over the map," Long said. "Those trends really are being driven by something other than presidential policy," since the peaks and valleys don’t coincide with presidential terms, she said. As we’ve noted in a previous fact check, the president, as the head of the executive branch, can order changes to prosecutorial priorities. For instance, following the Newtown, Conn. school shooting in December 2012, Obama did call for the need to "maximize enforcement efforts to prevent gun violence and prosecute gun crime." We don’t yet have data that reflects prosecutions in the aftermath of Newtown. But it’s important to note that Obama’s priorities are not the only factors at play in these decisions. Any presidential shift in policy must filter down to the attorney general, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives field offices, and front-line attorneys, said Ronald Frandsen, grants administrator for the Regional Justice Information Service. U.S. attorneys can decline to prosecute gun cases for a variety of reasons, as outlined by TRAC. So Obama is responsible for setting the broad policy approach to gun prosecutions, but he isn’t micromanaging individual cases. Much of the decision-making occurs at a lower level. Our ruling Cruz said prosecution of gun crimes under the Bush administration was 30 percent higher than it is under Obama. It’s possible to get a decline that big by cherry-picking the data, but the most inclusive method actually produces an increase. Cruz also overstates the role of the president in determining prosecution rates. We rate Cruz’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-05829	Says in his years as a Texas legislator, "we passed three pay increases for teachers and provided them with health insurance."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/feb/17/paul-sadler/paul-sadler-says-he-and-others-gave-texas-teachers/	Facebook was but a gleam in a Harvard student’s eye the last time Paul Sadler held public office. But the former Democratic state legislator embraced the social networking site’s political potential after he declared his candidacy to succeed the retiring U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison late last year. And on Jan. 27, 2012, Sadler posted this Facebook update: "In the time I worked on education issues, we passed 3 pay increases for teachers and provided them with health insurance." Teachers got all that in Sadler’s legislative era? We wondered. Sadler, a lawyer who works with the Wind Coalition energy advocacy group, won election to the Texas House on Nov. 6, 1990. For 12 years, he represented the East Texas district around Henderson, and for eight years he chaired the House Public Education Committee. Also, in 1997 and 2001, he headed committees on taxes and public school financing. During his legislative tenure, he also served on and chaired committees on health insurance for teachers and other education subcommittees. In response to our inquiry, Sadler campaign spokesman Jeff Rotkoff told us that in 1995, Sadler helped lead an overhaul of state education laws that tied teacher pay hikes to increases in state education aid, which brought raises in 1997 and 1998. And in 1999, Rotkoff said, Sadler sponsored a $3,000-a-year pay raise for teachers. In 2001, Rotkoff said, Sadler wrote a proposal that created a health insurance program for school employees. Separately, we confirmed that: Sadler sponsored the House version of Senate Bill 1 in 1995. The proposal, authored by Sen. Bill Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant, revised the state’s public education laws across the board; it was approved by the Senate in March 1995 and the House about two months later and then signed into law May 30, 1995. Brock Gregg, governmental relations director for the Association of Texas Professional Educators told us in an interview that the overhaul changed the schedule of teacher pay raises; as a result, he said, most teachers saw pay increases in 1995-96. Gregg said lawmakers also added a salary "escalator" to the state’s education code. That provision said that whenever state funding to a school district increased, the district’s salary schedule must also increase. After the 1997 Legislature wrote a budget drawing on a revenue surplus, Gregg said, all Texas teachers fielded pay raises thanks to the established escalator clause. He said one raise of 5.5 percent occurred in 1997-98 and another, of 1 percent, kicked in during 1998-99. These figures match those sent to us by the Texas Education Agency. In a telephone interview, Sadler said that the "escalator" sprang from an idea he floated and Ratliff fleshed out, which then became law. Gregg said that although the original "escalator" was scrapped in 1999, lawmakers later made other efforts to ensure teachers got pay raises when districts fielded additional state aid. Another raise arose after the 1999 Legislature advanced Senate Bill 4, which was authored by Sen. Teel Bivins, R-Amarillo, carried in the House by Sadler and took effect Sept. 1, 1999. The Austin American-Statesman reported May 31, 1999, that the measure gave Texas teachers "their biggest pay raise ever" as part of the "largest public school spending increase in state history." From a total $2.1 billion for public schools, $1.7 billion went to pay raises, the story said, with teachers getting at least $3,000 more that year. So, multiple raises accounted for. And what about Sadler’s claim about "providing" teacher health insurance? In 2001, Sadler authored House Bill 3343, the "Texas School Employees Uniform Group Health Coverage Act" (that’s TSEUGHCA, if you speak Gaelic), which was signed into law June 15, 2001. It created the TRS-ActiveCare program, a state-managed insurance pool. At the time, most districts offered insurance plans to their employees, including teachers, according to an August 2000 TRS study. Texas Education Agency data show teachers made up about half of school employees in 2000. The TRS study says, though, that only 38 percent of about 535,000 Texas public school employees had coverage comparable to that of state employees. Some 50 percent had insurance that did not compare favorably to state coverage, and 12 percent of employees did not sign up for district-offered coverage, the study says. Only 350 employees in 17 of the state’s 1,000-plus districts were offered no coverage at all, the study says. Sadler told us his 2001 proposal was intended both to extend coverage to all school employees and to raise the quality of coverage so that all employees had access to comparable insurance. According to a 2001 report by the nonpartisan House Research Organization, the 1991 Legislature had directed school districts to give employees coverage equivalent to that of state workers, but the law lacked enforcement provisions. Gregg told us in interviews that the 2001 TRS-ActiveCare program was created to acquire and administer group insurance from a third party, and the law also gave all teachers $1,000 per year toward its cost. Association of Texas Professional Educators lobbyist Josh Sanderson told us via email that the $1,000 stipend was intended to be an annual payment but was cut to $500 in 2003 for full-time teachers and then, in a 2006 special session, rolled into a $2,500 raise in educators’ pay. According to a May 2002 guide to the law produced by the Legislative Budget Board, after the first sign-up deadline of Sept. 30, 2001, small districts and other entities employing a total 147,000 people had joined TRS-ActiveCare. Larger districts were added later, though not all chose to participate. Currently, Texas State Teachers Association spokesman Clay Robison told us by email, all Texas teachers have access to insurance comparable to state employees’. ActiveCare covers more than 445,000 employees and dependents, he said, and 89 percent of eligible districts and similar education entities participate in the program. Austin and Houston are examples of large districts that have their own health plans, he said. Sadler said that although nearly 40 percent of school employees had comparable coverage before 2001, he believes such accounting doesn’t give an accurate picture of the 2001 law’s impact. He said he didn’t remember the 1991 mandate that districts offer comparable coverage, but it obviously had little effect. Of his work on teacher pay raises and insurance, Sadler said, "I know it changed the landscape." Teacher lobby groups have hailed Sadler’s advocacy. In a Dec. 2, 2001, Statesman news story, TSTA director of governmental relations Jay Levin credits Sadler with helping to bring about the 1999 raise of $3,000 and the health insurance program for teachers. Robison told us it’s fair for Sadler to claim credit for the pay raises and insurance initiative because he chaired the public education panel through those years. Gregg likewise said Sadler merits a goodly share of the credit. "Sadler was the leading proponent for pay increases and later health insurance for educators," Gregg said. Our ruling Sadler played a pivotal role in ensuring several teacher pay raises and also was key to lawmakers giving school workers including teachers access to insurance benefits equal to those accorded state employees. However, contrary to Sadler’s Facebook wording, the latter development did not provide teachers with insurance. Nearly every Texas teacher had access to some kind of coverage before the 2001 action. Still, the Sadler-authored change gave every school employee access to insurance equivalent to state workers’ coverage. We rate Sadler’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-03006	The federal government "has $3 trillion in cash flow, so we can pay our bills" and won’t default.	half-true	/texas/statements/2013/oct/16/roger-williams/roger-willliams-correct-government-could-cover-pro/	In an interview, first-term U.S. Rep. Roger Williams vowed not to vote for raising the federal debt ceiling. "I just won’t do it," the Austin Republican was quoted as saying in an Oct. 11, 2013, Austin American-Statesman news story. Besides, Williams said, even if the debt ceiling isn’t raised, "we are not going to default. We have $3 trillion in cash flow, so we can pay our bills." We wondered about that, mindful that the U.S. Treasury secretary has speculated about the risks of the government not having enough cash on hand. Treasury secretary's warning The debt ceiling, now nearly $16.7 trillion, constrains how much the government can borrow to meet obligations. And in October 2013, the Treasury secretary, Jack Lew, told a Senate panel that unless Congress raised the ceiling, "extraordinary measures" taken since the spring would be exhausted no later than Oct. 17 "at which point the federal government will have run out of borrowing authority. At that point, we will be left to meet our country’s commitments with only the cash on hand and any incoming revenues, placing our economy in a dangerous position. "If we have insufficient cash on hand," Lew said, "it would be impossible for the United States of America to meet all of its obligations, including Social Security and Medicare benefits, payments to our military and veterans and contracts with private suppliers for the first time in our history. At the same time," he said, "we’re relying on investors from all over the world to continue to hold U.S. bonds. Every week we roll over approximately $100 billion in U.S. (Treasury) bills. If U.S. bond-holders decided that they wanted to be repaid rather than continuing to roll over their investments, we could unexpectedly dissipate our entire cash balance." Williams' backup cites projected interest costs We asked Williams how he reached his conclusion. By email, Williams’ spokeswoman Haley Graves provided a transcript of the Statesman’s question to Williams, who has long owned automobile dealerships, and his response. Statesman: "Do you think the warnings about what a failure to enact a debt ceiling increase, the effect on the economy, is overblown or is that real?" Williams: "We’re not going to default because we do have $3 trillion of cash flow coming in to America. Alright? Now the cash flow doesn’t flow evenly – it’s like your business. You have receivable, this and that, but you do have $3 trillion in cash. That’s more cash flow than we’ve ever had coming in to the government than ever. And so we can pay our bills. We can pay our debt service. We can pay our military. We’re not going to default." Graves said Williams based his $3 trillion reference on a May 2013 projection by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that the government would collect $3.042 trillion in revenues through the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, 2013. Asked if Williams was referring to the government paying all its bills, Graves said Williams has said "all along" that the government will not default because its cash flow would be enough to pay bond holders and to fulfill interest payments. What's default? Observers of the debt-ceiling debate diverge on how to define a government default, though they agree it’s not happened before. By telephone, economist Chris Edwards of the Cato Institute, a limited-government think tank, said Williams’ main point is supported by the CBO’s projection of $237 billion in net interest costs through the same fiscal year. Everyone agrees not paying such interest would hurt financial markets, Edwards said, but his sense is that if interest costs are paid on time, the government can avoid default, though that course could prove "ugly," he said, because the Treasury would need to pick and choose which other obligations--ranging from Social Security checks to Pentagon contracts--to pay in full and on time. "It would make people very mad," Edwards said, "but it wouldn’t be a default." Edwards also noted an Oct. 2, 2013, Yahoo Finance interview with David Stockman. Stockman, who headed the Office of Management and Budget under President Ronald Reagan, said that if the debt ceiling isn’t raised, the government could easily tap incoming revenue to make its interest payments while also covering regular payments to Social Security retirees, the armed services and Medicare reimbursements. "It is a complete red herring to say there will be a default," Stockman said. "There will never be a time in which there is not enough cash to pay the interest." Then again, Edwards told us, a counter-argument he attributed to liberals and Democrats is that it would be very hard for the Treasury to make the described alternative spending choices. A Brookings Institution economist, Gary Burtless, said by email that it’s conceivable the Treasury could prevent default on government-backed securities by keeping up with interest payments, though he said he lacked the expertise to judge whether the Treasury could legally implement a choose-the-bill-to-pay strategy. Realistically, Burtless said, if the government runs short of the revenue required to pay non-interest costs, that would seem like a default to any affected creditors. "If a business makes timely payments on its secured and unsecured bank debt but does not make promised payment to its suppliers (for supplies already delivered), workers (for hours of work already supplied), and pensioners (for pensions promised under the company pension plan)," he said, "most observers would say the company has defaulted on its obligations to some of its creditors. Suppliers, workers, and pensioners are creditors of the company just as certainly as banks that have extended the company a loan." Also responding to our inquiry, economist Jared Bernstein of the liberal-leaning Center on Budget Policy Priorities pointed out by email that the CBO-projected $3 trillion in revenue stands to be outpaced by predicted expenditures of $3.6 trillion in the fiscal year. This leads to a key question, Bernstein said, as to whether there will be days when cash flow undershoots what must be paid. Bernstein noted that a September 2013 report by the Bipartisan Policy Center said this will occur with, for instance, revenue a few weeks after mid-October 2013 running behind spending demands by more than $100 billion. The report also said that if the government exhausted its ability to pay all its bills by Oct. 18, 2013, the Treasury would run about $106 billion short of meeting obligations over the next 20 business days. "Approximately 32% of the funds owed for the period would go unpaid," the report said, with the reality proving "chaotic." Uncertainty at Treasury We did not find any indication that the Treasury has aired a strategy to pick and choose which bills it pays in the event of cash-flow slowing. A Sept. 19, 2013, report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service floated opposite speculations. In 2012, the report said, a Treasury official said the agency lacked congressional guidance on prioritization and hence only had a system to pay bills as they came in, one after the other. In contrast, according to the report, the Government Accountability Office said in a 1985 letter to the then-chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Bob Packwood, that the Treasury was "free to liquidate obligations in any order it finds will best serve the interests of the United States." Burtless said that his understanding is the Treasury cannot prioritize its payments to contractors, Social Security pensioners, Medicare payees (doctors and hospitals that have provided services to the Medicare-insured population), non-furloughed civilian workers, members of the uniformed military, etc. If a supplier, a pensioner, a non-furloughed worker, military serviceperson, doctor or hospital does not receive timely payment, does that constitute a ‘default’?" An Oct. 13, 2013, PolitiFact story listing questions and answers about the debt ceiling said that if the ceiling is not raised, the government isn’t expected to have sufficient cash to meet all obligations in a timely manner past the beginning of November 2013, at latest. "So what happens then?" PolitiFact wrote. "The most obvious solution (beyond simply doing nothing) is to prioritize payments. Bondholders would likely be paid off first, since a missed or delayed payment on a financial instrument would entail the most severe peril for the government. Outraging senior citizens by delaying or missing a Social Security check is bad enough, the thinking goes, but if investors decide en masse to abandon U.S. bonds in the future, it would put the entire stability of the federal government’s finances (and ultimately, the U.S. economy) at risk. And according to experts, prioritization has problems. "For one thing, the federal government’s computer systems are not set up to do this, meaning it might not be a practical option (and could result in costly errors)," PolitiFact said. "In addition, the Treasury says it’s not clear it would have the legal authority to make those sorts of decisions. And it could cost more, since the law requires the government to pay interest on top of any payments that are delayed. It’s also not clear whether prioritizing bondholder payments would keep the United States from a ‘default.’ "It all depends on how you define the word ‘default.’ Some lawmakers who downplay the consequences of hitting the debt ceiling argue that a default only happens if interest on securities isn’t paid. A missed payment to a federal contractor or a Social Security recipient, according to this argument, doesn’t trigger a default." The story noted that the CRS has "acknowledged that there’s no clear answer to this question, but it does note that Black’s Law Dictionary defines the term ‘default’ as ‘the failure to make a payment when due’ — a definition that does not restrict a default to a missed interest payment. Ultimately, CRS notes, ‘financial markets’ perceptions of what constitutes a default, or a real threat of default, may be more relevant when assessing the potential impacts of not raising the debt limit.’" Our ruling Williams said the government "has $3 trillion in cash flow, so we can pay our bills" and won’t default. In the 12 months through September 2014, the government is projected to raise $3 trillion in revenue, far more than enough to cover some $237 billion in its projected interest costs. In this way, perhaps, default could be avoided. Still, Williams made a broader reference to paying "our bills," and on that front, there’s debate over whether the government could meet all its obligations or have the authority to pick and choose what to pay. These are important details. We rate this partly accurate claim as Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-01249	Amendment 2 on medical marijuana won a higher percentage of the vote than the last six Florida governors, including Jeb Bush’s 2002 landslide.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/nov/13/united-care/medical-marijuana-amendment-was-more-popular-winni/	Floridians turned down a state constitutional amendment for medical marijuana, but it’s clear a majority of voters were all for the idea. Amendment 2, which would have changed the state’s Constitution to allow the sale of cannabis for "certain medical conditions" such as cancer and Parkinson’s disease, rang up 57.6 percent of the vote. Unfortunately for the measure’s supporters, amendments require at least 60 percent of the vote to pass. That close margin means that medical marijuana will continue to be debated, and not just in Florida. Two dozen states have medical marijuana laws, and Oregon and the District of Columbia voted to decriminalize recreational pot in the same general election. Ben Pollara, the campaign manager for the group behind the amendment, United for Care, tweeted two days after the election that the drug proved more popular than Florida’s governors. The tweet read: "#YesOn2 got a higher % of the vote than the last 6 #flgov including @JebBush in his 2002 landslide #tallyorbust #2016." We know the last couple of elections Gov. Rick Scott hasn’t even had to break 50 percent of the total votes in order to win, but is Pollara right about the last six Florida governors not garnering as much as 57.6 percent? The voting rolls The Twitter shorthand "#flgov" generally refers to the gubernatorial campaign, but has been used interchangeably to denote any tweet about a governor, too. We reached out to Pollara to ask him to clarify whether he meant the last six governors or the last six gubernatorial elections, because there’s a difference. Pollara told us he meant the last six gubernatorial elections, going back to Lawton Chiles’ victory over Jeb Bush in 1994. But because of the tweet’s wording, we looked at the last six governors elected, some of whom served two terms, going back to the 1978 campaign. Keep in mind, we’re looking for governors who won 57.6 percent of the vote or higher. Election year Governor Winning votes Total votes Percentage 1978 Bob Graham 1,406,580 2,530,468 55.6% 1982 Bob Graham 1,739,553 2,688,566 64.7% 1986 Bob Martinez 1,847,525 3,386,171 54.6% 1990 Lawton Chiles 1,995,206 3,530,871 56.5% 1994 Lawton Chiles 2,135,008 4,206,659 50.8% 1998 Jeb Bush 2,191,105 3,964,441 55.3% 2002 Jeb Bush 2,856,845 5,100,581 56.0% 2006 Charlie Crist 2,519,845 4,829,270 52.2% 2010 Rick Scott 2,619,335 5,359,735 48.9% 2014 Rick Scott 2,865,075 5,950,867 48.2% Source: Florida Department of State, Division of Elections If we were to look only at the last six elections, Pollara could be correct, because the highest margin of victory going back to 1994 was Bush’s 56 percent in 2002 against Bill McBride. As Pollara noted when we contacted him, if you’re counting that way, it could be the last eight elections. But if we’re going by individuals elected governor, there’s one obvious outlier: Graham, who was immensely popular and beat Republican state legislator Skip Bafalis with 64.7 percent of the vote in 1982. For comparison, Amendment 2 garnered 3,370,323 out of 5,849,118 votes cast for the measure to get that 57.6 percent. That’s more individual votes than any winning candidate has ever received. Our ruling Pollara said Amendment 2 won a higher percentage of the vote than the last six Florida governors, including Bush’s 2002 landslide. He’s right about the 2002 contest, and when you look back at the last six elections (eight, really) as Pollara intended, that’s true, too. But there’s a glaring outlier when you look at the last six people elected governor -- Graham’s 1982 win, when he garnered 64.7 percent of the vote. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-05111	"Over the last few decades, the income of the top 1 percent grew by more than 275 percent -- to an average of $1.3 million a year."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/jun/28/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-income-top-earners-275-percent-1/	While campaigning this month in Cleveland, President Barack Obama reframed his general election fight with Mitt Romney as a battle between the haves and the have-nots. Casting himself as a champion for the latter, Obama argued that his Republican opponent embraced fiscal policies that helped steer the country into recession. The election, he said, will be "a make-or-break moment for America’s middle class." The address at Cuyahoga Community College followed remarks that same afternoon from Romney in Cincinnati. Combined, the events offered a preview of how each will spend the coming months positioning himself as the candidate who can steer an economic recovery. The dueling speeches were considered far and wide to represent a key moment, given that it was the first time Obama and Romney had campaigned in the same state on the same day. Leaving aside the rhetoric, PolitiFact Ohio decided to look closer at the numbers the president used to make his case. In particular, two figures Obama shared at Tri-C caught our attention. "Over the last few decades," Obama said early in his 53-minute speech, "the income of the top 1 percent grew by more than 275 percent -- to an average of $1.3 million a year." The president had painted a picture of inequality. But was it an accurate one? Let’s start with the first half of the statement. Data released last October by the independent Congressional Budget Office shows that, on average, those Americans among the richest 1 percent saw their after-tax household income rise 275 percent between 1979 and 2007. Those not quite as prosperous but nonetheless among the top 20 percent saw income grow by 65 percent over that period. Middle-class incomes grew roughly 40 percent. And among the bottom 20 percent, income was about 18 percent higher in 2007 than in 1979. So while income increased across the board, the top 1 percent easily outpaced the pack. "As a result of that uneven income growth, the distribution of after-tax household income in the United States was substantially more unequal in 2007 than in 1979," the CBO reported. "In fact, between 2005 and 2007, the after-tax income received by the 20 percent of the population with the highest income exceeded the after-tax income of the remaining 80 percent." The second half of Obama’s statement can be traced to a report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 34 developed countries that sets international standards on a wide range of topics. The report, released in December and titled "Divided We Stand: Why Inequality Keeps Rising," found that, on average, the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans earned $1.3 million a year after taxes. Though Obama didn’t mention it in his speech, that figure dwarfs the average $17,700 made by the poorest 20 percent, according to the OECD. Before we get to the Truth-O-Meter, there are three points worth raising. First, while Obama said that growth for the richest 1 percent was more than 275 percent, the CBO study adds no such quantifier. The president indulged in some hyperbole, but not so much that it created a false impression that the disparity is measurably larger than it is. Second, Obama time-pegged his assertion to "the last few decades." Obama’s speech focused singularly on the policies of his Republican predecessor, George W. Bush. Also in the White House during those decades were two Democrats: Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. The third point comes via the Washington Post. When fact-checking Obama’s Tri-C speech, the Post’s Glenn Kessler noted that while it’s accurate that the average income among the top 1 percent is $1.3 million, describing top earners that way is "an interesting sleight of hand." According to the CBO, you’re in the top 1 percent if your household income exceeds $352,000. "By using an average," Kessler wrote, "Obama is able to cite a much higher figure." But it’s also important to stress that the numbers Obama used come from agencies respected for independence. These three points, while helpful in painting a fuller picture, do not diminish the accuracy of the numbers or the context in which the president delivered them. Knowing them, though, provides some clarification. As such, we rate Obama’s statement Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-06-28T06:00:00	2012-06-14	['None']
pomt-08364	Says "Scott Walker wants to make abortion illegal, even in cases of rape, incest or to protect the life of the mother."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/26/tom-barrett/tom-barrett-says-scott-walker-wants-ban-abortion-e/	In a gubernatorial campaign largely centered on jobs and the job performance of the candidates, Democrat Tom Barrett has injected abortion into the debate, using a stark TV ad to take aim at his opponent, Republican Scott Walker. A couple identified as Lana and Mike appear on the screen. Mike says their teenage daughter was brutally raped. "You can’t imagine what she went through," he says. "That’s why politicians like Scott Walker make me so mad." The screen goes black. Then as Mike continues, the words he says also appear on the screen: "Scott Walker wants to make abortion illegal, even in cases of rape, incest, or to protect the life of the mother." Mike concludes: "Who is Scott Walker to play God with our family?" and -- repeating a common theme from Barrett and the Democratic side -- says he feels Walker is "too extreme for Wisconsin." As voters weigh their choices in the Nov. 2, 2010, election, there is no dispute that Barrett is pro-choice and Walker is pro-life. But Barrett’s claim, which may be new to many viewers of the ad, is that Walker wants to outlaw abortion under any circumstances. It is worth noting that many voters who consider themselves pro-life support make an exception for abortion being available in cases of rape, incest or to protect the life of the mother. A May 2009 Gallup poll, however, found that 23 percent of Americans -- up from 17 percent a year earlier -- said abortion should be illegal under all circumstances. For his part, Walker has said repeatedly he opposes abortion, even in cases of rape and incest. He declares himself "100 percent pro-life." And to Pro-Life Wisconsin, an organization that opposes abortion without exception, Walker pledged to seek a complete abortion ban. We asked Jill Bader, Walker’s campaign spokeswoman, about Barrett’s ad and she said it accurately states Walker’s position. (We would note that as a member of the state Assembly, Walker backed an effort to bar government employees from performing abortions and a bill outlawing "partial-birth abortion"; both measures included an exception for when the life of the mother is at stake.) This is one item we can assess quickly. In the race for governor, Democrat Tom Barrett said his opponent, Republican Scott Walker, "wants to make abortion illegal, even in cases of rape, incest, or to protect the life of the mother." Walker acknowledges that is his position. We rate Barrett’s claim True.	None	Tom Barrett	None	None	None	2010-10-26T09:00:00	2010-10-21	['None']
pomt-01787	Says Rick Scott cut "Bright Futures scholarships in half."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/jul/25/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-rick-scott-cut-bright-futures-h/	Former Gov. Charlie Crist continued his attacks on Gov. Rick Scott’s education funding record in a TV ad set at St. Petersburg High School, Crist’s alma mater. "This isn’t just a doorway to a school. It was my doorway as a public school kid to opportunity. And I want to make sure every child has that same chance for a better life," Crist says in the ad. "But Rick Scott's education cuts are closing that door on Florida's kids, spending almost $200 less per student than when I was governor and cutting Bright Futures scholarships in half." Here we will fact-check whether Scott cut Bright Futures scholarships in half. Bright Futures funding and scholarships Launched in 1997, Bright Futures is the higher education scholarship program funded by the Lottery and designed to keep high-achieving students at Florida schools. The program’s costs spiraled up from an initial price tag of $70 million in 1997 to $437 million in 2011. Those rising costs led the Legislature to rein in the program. In 2010, Crist’s last year as governor, the Legislature reduced Bright Futures scholarships by $1 dollar for every credit hour. The law also raised SAT/ACT requirements incrementally over a few years, which was expected to lead to a drop in the number of students who would qualify. For example, the Legislature raised the minimum SAT requirement for Florida Medallion Scholars -- one subset of Bright Futures -- from 970 in 2010-11 to 1050 in 2013-14. So that means that the Legislature and Crist reduced the number of eligible students in the future, after Scott took over as governor. When Scott took over, he and the Legislature continued on that same path -- but made it even harder for students to qualify. In 2011, Scott’s first year as governor, the Legislature decided to further raise test scores for 2013-14 graduates. For example, those Medallion Scholars would now have to score 1170 on their SAT by 2013-14. When Crist says that under Scott the scholarships were cut in "half," it’s possible for viewers to mistakenly believe that refers to total dollars spent, or the amount of individual scholarships. Instead, what the ad is referring to is the number of scholarships distributed. The text on the screen shows that it refers to a May 2014 Sun-Sentinel editorial criticizing Bright Futures cuts, and this is what the Crist campaign pointed us to regarding the ad. As the requirements rose, not surprisingly the number of students who obtained the scholarship has dropped. Due to the tougher standards, "the number of new Bright Futures scholarship students will be cut almost in half – from 41,107 last fall to 21,340 this fall," the editorial board wrote. That number for this fall is based on an estimate from the state regarding how many students will qualify. After schools verify that scholarship recipients enrolled in eligible courses, the schools submit for reimbursement to the state -- and that’s when we learn the actual number of scholarships that were used. Here are recent years’ numbers on Bright Futures. The spending picture is not settled for the current and future fiscal years, so we have included an estimate for 2013-14 and 2014-15. Budget Year Initial students disbursed Total number of students served Amount of money disbursed Average award per student 2007-08 50,499 159,170 $379.8 million $2,387 2008-09 52,497 169,366 $429 million $2,533 2009-10 53,520 177,612 $423.5 million $2,385 2010-11 53,800 179,076 $423.3 million $2,364 2011-12 51,751 174,047 $333.8 million $1,918 2012-13 44,846 162,980 $312.1 million $1,915 2013-14 estimated 41,107 154,160 $309.4 million $2,007 2014-15 estimated 21,340 127,573 $266.2 million $2,087 Source: Florida Department of Education We think there are three main issues with the accuracy of the ad: • The ad could create the false impression that the amount of money per scholarship (or total money) was cut in half, when it’s actually referring to the number of scholarships. • The number of scholarships dropping by a half is based on the state’s estimate of how many will qualify this fall. But we don’t yet know the final number. • Though the ad points the finger at Scott, Crist also oversaw changes to Bright Futures that reduced the number of eligible students during Scott’s administration. Our ruling A Crist TV ad says Scott cut Bright Futures scholarships "in half." Viewers could mistakenly think that Scott cut the dollar amount of scholarships in half -- but he didn’t. Instead, Crist’s campaign zeroed in on the number of scholarships that were distributed last year compared to an estimate for the upcoming school year. While the ad blames Scott, under Crist the Legislature also raised the standards to reduce the number of scholarships awarded. Scott and the Legislature later raised the standards again, which is projected to reduce the number more. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.

pomt-06870	Says U.S. Rep. Ron Kind’s "stimulus cost taxpayers $278,000 per job."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/aug/01/national-republican-congressional-committee/stimulus-jobs-cost-taxpayers-gop-committee-says-in/	Finding a Republican who likes President Barack Obama’s stimulus plan might be harder than finding a hair comb-over that’s truly convincing. There almost certainly are no stimulus fans at the National Republican Congressional Committee, which is devoted to electing Republicans to the U.S. House of Representatives. In January 2009, the NRCC criticized the stimulus allotment of $335 million for sexually transmitted disease prevention programs. Our colleagues at PolitiFact National rated that claim Mostly True. In an October 2010 claim against then-U.S. Rep. Steve Kagen, D-Wis., the NRCC said the stimulus cost Wisconsin "77,000 jobs lost." We rated that one Pants on Fire. And the attacks have continued. In a July 5, 2011, news release, the committee singled out U.S. Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., saying "Kind’s stimulus cost taxpayers $278,000 per job." Although the stimulus wasn’t his plan, Kind voted for it. Eleven House Democrats and all House Republicans voted against it. As we noted in our NRCC item about Kagen, critics say the $830 billion cost of the stimulus has bought too few jobs, and unemployment has grown generally worse since Obama signed the measure into law in February 2009. But the claim that the stimulus spent $278,000 for every job it created is striking. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Ohio and PolitiFact Texas already have examined it. PolitiFact Ohio found that the statistic originated in a blog posting on the website of The Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine. The posting by Jeffrey H. Anderson attributes the $278,000-per-job cost to "Obama’s economists." But to come up with that amount, Anderson did his own math with figures from a status report on the stimulus by Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers. Citing the report, Anderson said the stimulus had added or saved just under 2.4 million jobs at a cost to date of $666 billion. He divided the $666 billion by 2.4 million jobs to come up with a rounded-up figure of $278,000 per job. Here’s how our colleagues sized up two reiterations of the claim: House Speaker John Boehner PolitiFact Ohio weighed in after Boehner, an Ohio Republican, tweeted about the blog post. Our colleagues rated Boehner’s echoing of the $278,000 cost as False, pointing out that it lumps all of the various types of stimulus spending together. Stimulus spending, as the Associated Press noted in a fact check of a similar GOP claim, pays not only for the worker but for material, supplies and that worker's output -- a portion of a road paved, for example. Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst Dewhurst, a Republican, also tweeted about the blog posting. PolitiFact Texas found that of the $666 billion stimulus spending to date, 43 percent was spent on tax cuts for individuals and businesses; 19 percent went to state governments, primarily for education and Medicaid; 13 percent paid for government benefits to individuals such as unemployment and food stamps; and the remaining roughly 24 percent was spent on projects such as infrastructure improvement. That underscores how stimulus money was spent on many things in addition to creating jobs. Our Texas colleagues rated Dewhurst’s claim False. That’s two False ratings on the same claim. We asked the NRCC if it had any evidence beyond the blog post cited by Boehner and Dewhurst to back up its version of the statement -- that "Kind’s stimulus cost taxpayers $278,000 per job." Spokeswoman Andrea Bozek cited various reports critical of the stimulus, but nothing to establish that the $278,000 figure is correct. To review: The National Republican Congressional Committee, like Boehner and Dewhurst, claimed that the federal stimulus cost $278,000 per job. The NRCC called it "Kind’s stimulus" because U.S. Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., voted for it. Our PolitiFact colleagues have twice ruled the claim False and the NRCC offered us no new evidence to consider. We rate its claim False, as well.

pomt-14597	"We've cut taxes 50 times and look what has happened to our revenues. They've grown."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/feb/04/rick-scott/scott-credits-tax-cuts-floridas-growing-tax-revenu/	Gov. Rick Scott’s $1 billion tax-cut request is giving the Florida Legislature plenty to chew on, especially after state economists warned that revenues won’t be as high as once thought. Scott wants a range of cuts, including a reduction in the sales tax on commercial rents and a $770 million break for manufacturers and retailers by getting rid of their corporate income tax. Despite concerns over how the size of his request will affect the budget, Scott was confident the math makes it an easy decision for lawmakers. "We have plenty of money to be able to do tax cuts," Scott said Jan. 20, 2016, after state economists warned tax revenues would be less than previously estimated. "Let's look at history. We've cut taxes 50 times and look what has happened to our revenues. They've grown." Scott has used this line repeatedly in recent weeks. We wondered whether revenues have continued to grow even as Tallahassee has passed tax changes over recent years. Revenue roundup Scott’s line about 50 tax cuts is a talking point that just keeps on growing. We have rated claims about him cutting 24 tax cuts, 40 tax cuts, and more than 40 tax cuts, Half True, because Scott counted many small tax changes for specific industries as overall tax cuts. What’s new this time around, in a nutshell, are 16 provisions passed in 2015, most of which were part of a $429 million tax-cut package. The full list is largely comprised of esoteric tax credits (mostly for businesses), changes in unemployment compensation and sales tax holidays. There also was a rate reduction on the Communications Services Tax on cellphone and cable service that amounts to about $21 per $100 on a bill and a $60,000 cap on taxes for boat repairs. Several of those may help businesses, but really don’t often do much for everyday Floridians, especially if they needed to collect unemployment. Many times, local governments may raise taxes to make up for their own lost revenue. In short, it’s arguable whether all of those qualify as tax cuts, but they did have an impact on how many tax dollars the state brought in. Economists told us, however, that while you can project how much year-over-year revenues may be changed from cuts, it’s tough to attribute any concrete economic growth to those changes. Because of overall economic growth, tax revenues have been rising since Scott became governor as the state was climbing out of the Great Recession. We surveyed several years of general revenue, which is funded by taxes and fees and can be used by the Legislature for any purpose, alongside the state's rate of economic growth. Fiscal year General revenue Growth rate 2008-09 $21 billion -12.8 percent 2009-10 $21.5 billion 2.4 percent 2010-11 $22.55 billion 4.8 percent 2011-12* $23.6 billion 4.7 percent 2012-13 $25.3 billion 7.2 percent 2013-14 $26.2 billion 3.5 percent 2014-15 $27.7 billion 5.7 percent 2015-16 $28.4 billion 2.1 percent (*Scott’s first full fiscal year in office) Source: Florida Office of Economic & Demographic Research State economist Amy Baker noted that even with Florida’s economy growing, that growth rate is currently below the state’s historical average, and the cumulative effects of prior tax changes are eating into revenues more than expected. State budget forecasters have announced that tax revenues will come in at $400 million less than previously expected. Scott’s office has rejected those figures in pursuit of his biggest round of tax cuts, saying the Legislature has plenty of money to play with. But while it’s apparent that revenues have gone up even as Scott’s tax changes have been implemented, experts said it’s tough to directly link them. They said there are three main reasons Florida’s revenues have grown during the nationwide recovery: Population growth, rising property values and overall inflation. More than 1 million people have moved to Florida since 2010, property values are recovering from the housing bust, and inflation makes tax collections go up as costs go up. Basically, more people are paying more taxes on things that cost more. Norton Francis, senior research associate with the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said that despite being the third-largest state, the growth rate for Florida’s tax revenues has started to lag behind the national average. "What you need to look at is, are (tax revenues) growing more than they used to?" Norton asked. "It could be that it’s come back as a whole, but it’s hard to pin that to a tax cut." Our ruling Scott said, "We've cut taxes 50 times and look what has happened to our revenues. They've grown." Scott has a debatable definition of tax cuts, but the state’s tax revenues have increased since he took office. Economists told us it would be difficult to attribute growth specifically to tax changes. The national economic recovery, population growth, higher property values and inflation are the major factors for the state’s growth. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2016-02-04T17:36:51	2016-01-20	['None']
pomt-03004	"Neville Chamberlain told the British people: ‘Accept the Nazis. Yes, they will dominate the continent of Europe, but that is not our problem. Let's appease them. Why? Because it can't be done. We cannot possibly stand against them.’"	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/oct/16/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-airs-popular-and-flawed-impression-britis/	In his September 2013 day-night-and-day U.S. Senate floor speech challenging the Obamacare law, Ted Cruz of Texas suggested that anyone saying the 2010 law could not be defunded was, well, being un-American. Brave colonists rebelled against the British, the Houston Republican said, when pundits of the age said it could not be done. Unionists later fought to preserve the nation, he said, even though "a lot of voices" said it could not be done. Cruz continued: "If we go to the 1940s, Nazi Germany — look, we saw it in Britain," Cruz said, as transcribed by the Hill, a Capitol Hill newspaper. "Neville Chamberlain told the British people: ‘Accept the Nazis. Yes, they will dominate the continent of Europe, but that is not our problem. Let's appease them. Why? Because it can't be done. We cannot possibly stand against them.’ "In America," Cruz said, "there were voices who listened to that, I suspect the same pundits who said it couldn't be done. If this had happened in the 1940s, we would have been listening to them. Even then they would have made television. They would have gotten beyond the carrier pigeons and letters and they would have been on TV saying: ‘You cannot defeat the Germans.’" Did Chamberlain declare his country should give way in Europe because it couldn’t withstand or defeat the Germans? We wondered. Senator's statement initially resonates Cruz offered no backup when we asked how he reached his characterization, which initially resonated because Chamberlain was unequivocally disinclined to war with Germany; he spent more than a year hoping diplomacy combined with rearmament would head off a showdown. Historians have written that he was hewing to a strategy of "appeasement," a concept subsequently disparaged along with Chamberlain, who has been characterized as a failed leader who nearly let the Nazis overrun his country. A Chamberlain biographical web page from the BBC touches on the basics: "Like many in Britain who had lived through World War One, Chamberlain was determined to avert another war. His policy of appeasement towards Adolf Hitler culminated in the Munich Agreement in which Britain and France accepted that the Czech region of the Sudetenland should be ceded to Germany. Chamberlain left Munich believing that by appeasing Hitler he had assured 'peace for our time'. However, in March 1939 Hitler annexed the rest of the Czech lands of Bohemia and Moravia, with Slovakia becoming a puppet state of Germany. Five months later in September 1939 Hitler's forces invaded Poland. Chamberlain responded with a British declaration of war on Germany. Historians say it didn't happen Still, four historians (including three based in England) uniformly told us Cruz’s claim was inaccurate in that it’s not correct that Chamberlain told the British people to accept Nazi domination of the continent because Britain couldn’t possibly stand against them. Cruz’s statement is "skewed," William Roger Louis, a University of Texas history professor whose specialties include the history and politics of 20th century Britain, said by telephone. "It’s a very distorted view." On Chamberlain’s embrace of "appeasement," Louis said: "What Chamberlain meant was a reasoned solution to the problem… In retrospect," the term "has come to mean a kind of defeatist view. That wasn’t the case at the time." By email, Chamberlain biographer Nick Smart, who teaches at England’s Plymouth University, said Chamberlain did not say anything about giving in to the Nazis "to anyone, let alone ‘the British people.’ There’s nothing like it in his diaries, speeches, or in any of the biographical treatments I have read." British historian and journalist Andrew Roberts said by email: "Of course" Chamberlain "didn't say that… He guaranteed" the protection of "Poland in 1939 and we were allied to France, so of course he didn't say Europe was not our problem. He declared wa(r) in Sept. 1939 sooner than have the Nazis in Poland and under Chamberlain we put troops into Belgium." Checking Chamberlain biographies Next, we dipped into books on Chamberlain for indications of what he told the British people about letting the Nazis control the continent across the English Channel. Chamberlain became prime minister in May 1937 amid national wariness of another international conflict less than two decades after World War I, what was then called the Great War. Italy’s Mussolini and Germany’s Hitler both showed signs of bellicosity. Chamberlain was mindful, too, that British forces needed time to rebuild, making it necessary for him to exploit diplomacy toward slowing or stopping aggressive moves by the other countries, Smart wrote in his 2010 book, "Neville Chamberlain." Chamberlain, Smart wrote, agreed that Britain "could not hope to meet simultaneously the threats of Germany, Japan and… Italy. It would therefore be necessary, as he saw it, to seek to confine and even isolate the German threat by using diplomacy to keep on friendly terms with Italy and Japan, whatever the provocation." Meantime, Smart wrote, the prime minister accelerated rearmament. Chamberlain’s approach: Hoping for the best and preparing for the worst. Chamberlain also said the country should "show our determination not to be bullied," Smart wrote. As noted by biographer Robert Self, Chamberlain said to the House of Commons in 1938: "It is perfectly evident surely now that force is the only argument Germany understands," going on to stress the import of showing a "visible force of overwhelming strength backed by the determination to use it." Chamberlain acceded on taking of Sudetenland Still, Britain did not object when Hitler occupied German-speaking parts of Czechoslovakia, the Sudetenland, that had been carved by treaty after World War I from what had been the Austro-Hungarian Empire. But later, when Hitler pushed beyond the Sudetenland to Prague, Britain delivered a "guarantee" of Polish independence, followed by similar vows to protect Greece, Romania and Turkey, Smart wrote. Thrice, Chamberlain personally conferred with Hitler, most famously (or infamously) in Munich in September 1938, after which he told the British people to acclaim that he believed he had secured "peace in our time." This was before Hitler pushed farther into Czechoslovakia and, through the summer of 1939, built up forces along Germany’s border with Poland. By email, Chamberlain biographer David Dutton, a professor at the University of Liverpool, told us "Chamberlain did not think the Nazis could be left to get on with what they wanted to do in continental Europe. If this had been the case, he would never have got involved in the 1938 Czechoslovakian crisis in the first place." Dutton also wrote: "What Chamberlain did understand was that Britain was in no position to resist Germany in the 1930s, not least because we could not look to reliable allies," including the isolationist United States. "He justly feared war, especially from the air… but he knew that it might eventually come and that Britain had to prepare for it as best she could," Dutton said. Generally, Dutton called Cruz’s claim "superficial and misleading." Chamberlain in charge when war was declared In the end, Chamberlain was prime minister when Great Britain and France declared war on Germany on Sept. 3, 1939, two days after he told the House of Commons that the British government had made it "crystal clear" to Germany that if it invaded Poland, "we were resolved to oppose them by force." He added that the responsibility belonged to Germany’s leader, Adolf Hitler, "who has not hesitated to plunge the world into misery in order to serve his own senseless ambitions." Noting that German troops had crossed into Poland and bombs were landing on defenseless towns, Chamberlain said: "In these circumstances there is only one course open to us." Chamberlain that day did not indicate the British couldn’t defeat the Nazis. Rather, he said British armed forces were better prepared than they had been for World War I. Chamberlain also indicated he had lost his patience with Germany in Europe. "It now only remains for us to set our teeth and to enter upon this struggle, which we ourselves earnestly endeavored to avoid, with determination to see it through to the end," he said. Otherwise, he said, "we shall merely pass from one crisis to another, and see one country after another attacked by methods which have now become familiar to us in their sickening technique. We are resolved that these methods must come to an end." Our ruling Cruz said Chamberlain "told the British people: ‘Accept the Nazis. Yes, they will dominate the continent of Europe, but that is not our problem. Let's appease them. Why? Because it can't be done. We cannot possibly stand against them.’ " We see an element of truth in this claim; Chamberlain invested repeatedly in diplomacy in hopes of heading off war and he bowed to some German objectives on the continent. But he simultaneously committed to British rearmament and also made it clear, publicly, that his nation would not sit back should Germany invade Poland. We rate this statement as Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-13542	Says "Donald Trump himself contributed $100,000" to the Clinton Foundation.	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2016/aug/28/david-plouffe/yes-donald-trump-donated-100000-clinton-foundation/	As Donald Trump amps up attacks on the Clinton Foundation, Democrats are pointing out that Trump himself has given to the nonprofit he now calls a pay-to-play operation. Recently released emails between Hillary Clinton’s aides when she was secretary of state and officials at the Clinton Foundation have demonstrated that some foundation donors did get access to Clinton, though there’s no evidence of direct favors. Addressing the topic on NBC’s Meet the Press, Barack Obama’s former campaign manager David Plouffe noted the Clinton Foundation’s work on HIV/AIDS and malaria and Trump’s own ties to the charity. "The Clinton Foundation, I think it’s a universal agreement, has done remarkable work around the world. I think Donald Trump himself contributed $100,000 to the foundation," he said. Plouffe is right that Trump gave at least $100,000 to the foundation, a fact that Trump and his campaign readily admit. One caveat: It appears that the money came through Trump’s own foundation, not directly from Trump. The Clinton Foundation lists Donald J. Trump as a contributor with a cumulative lifetime donation amount between $100,001 to $250,000. It’s not clear if Trump himself made a personal contribution, but tax forms show that the Donald J. Trump Foundation (which Trump controls) donated $100,000 to the foundation in 2009 and reserved a table at the Clinton Foundation gala for $10,000 in 2010. Trump’s daughter Ivanka is also listed as a donor who gave between $5,001 and $10,000 and her father-in-law, Charles Kushner, gave between $250,001 and $500,000. Trump’s gift amount places him in the top 0.2 percent of the foundation’s donors. Most of its 300,000 donors (85.5 percent) gave less than $250. Breaking it down by dollar amount, however, Trump’s total contribution isn’t that big. We estimated that the foundation has received at least $800 million in donations, over 70 percent of which came from gifts of $1 million or more. In 2009, the Trump Foundation gave $926,750 to some 40 organizations (page 18). The Clinton Foundation received one of the largest gifts that year, matched or surpassed only by the Arnold Palmer Medical Center Foundation ($100,000), the New York Presbyterian Hospital ($125,000) and the Police Athletic League ($156,000). Altogether, the Trump Foundation has donated $5.5 million to 298 charities between 2009 and 2013 according to the nonprofit’s tax forms, Forbes found. Trump did not make any personal contributions to his foundations during this time. (Money for the Trump Foundation in these years came from others and from investment income.) Trump doesn’t deny that he donated to the Clinton Foundation that he now calls a criminal enterprise. During the first GOP primary debate in August 2015, Trump voluntarily brought up his giving to the Clinton Foundation when asked about his previous donations to Hillary Clinton. "When they call, I give. And you know what? When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them, they are there for me," Trump said. "With Hillary Clinton, I said be at my wedding, and she came to my wedding. You know why? She didn’t have a choice, because I gave. I gave to a foundation that, frankly, that foundation is supposed to do good. I didn’t know her money would be used on private jets going all over the world." For the record, the Clintons did attend Trump’s third wedding to Melania Knauss, but that occurred in 2005, four years before the $100,000 donation. A few months later, Trump gave pretty similar answers when he was asked to explain the Forbes article on his charitable giving record in late January. "I did give to the Clinton Foundation. What I didn't know is they'd be using it for private aircraft and things like that. The Clinton Foundation was helping with Haiti and with lots of other things and I thought it was going to do some good work. So, it didn't make any difference to me," he said on Jan. 31’s Fox News Sunday. "Again, I was a businessman and it was my obligation to get along with everybody, including the Clintons, including Democrats and liberals and Republicans and conservatives." Our ruling Plouffe said, "Donald Trump himself gave $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation." Tax records show the Donald J. Trump Foundation gave $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation in 2009, and spent an additional $10,000 for a table at a Clinton Foundation gala the following year. The Clinton Foundation also lists Donald J. Trump (as well his daughter Ivanka and Ivanka’s father-in-law) as a contributor. It’s important to note that Trump made the donation through his foundation, not out of his personal income. But Trump himself acknowledges the donation.

pomt-14501	Says he cured Charlie Sheen and the island of Comoros of HIV with "milk from goats, which had arthritis."	pants on fire!	/global-news/statements/2016/feb/23/samir-chachoua/no-arthritic-goat-milk-cannot-cure-hiv/	An Australian doctor says he cured Charlie Sheen and the island nation of Comoros of HIV with a curious treatment — specifically, arthritic goat’s milk. Samir Chachoua first made headlines in January, when he became the subject of a Dr. Oz intervention. Sheen told Oz that he stopped taking conventional HIV medication for about a month after Chachoua’s treatment made HIV "undetectable" in his blood. Oz pointed out that Chachoua was not licensed to practice medicine in the United States and his method of convincing Sheen — by injecting himself with Sheen’s blood — was not only unorthodox, but highly inappropriate. Sheen agreed to take his medicine again. It gets weirder. A few weeks later, Chachoua expressed his disappointment in Sheen and touted his treatment on Jan. 29’s Real Time with Bill Maher. "I found a place in Mexico with all these IV drug users, prostitutes, all the high profile things that are necessary for AIDS but I didn’t find AIDS," he said. "What I found was, their people were drinking milk from goats, which had arthritis. These goats have a virus called CAEV, and this virus destroys HIV and protects people who drink it for life." This treatment, says Chachoua, not only cured Sheen but helped eradicate HIV in Comoros, an island nation in the Indian Ocean, in 2006. Let’s state off the bat that Chachoua has been, as Maher noted, "called a quack a million times." His claims that he eradicated HIV in Comoros in 2006 and cured Sheen are profoundly untrue. "We have no cure for AIDS and it’s certainly not going to be anything related to goat’s milk," said Jeffrey Laurence, the senior scientific consultant for programs at amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research. The facts on CAEV As its name suggests, the caprine arthritis encephalitis virus or CAEV — which is part of the same genus of viruses as HIV — causes arthritis and encephalitis in goats. Some research shows that infected goats may develop antibodies that will "cross react" with HIV. What does this mean? If you remember the lock-and-key model from your biology textbook, you’ll know that your body produces antibodies that are specific to an antigen. Some CAEV antibodies, in addition to flagging CAEV, can also identify HIV. Simply put, they recognize HIV as an antigen. That’s it. There is no evidence these antibodies "destroy" or protect against HIV, said Brian Murphy, a professor of pathology at the University of California Davis’ School of Veterinary Medicine, who’s studied CAEV. Scientists have actually known about this cross-reactivity for decades, but in the grand scheme of AIDS research, it’s meaningless, according to Laurence of amfAR. "It wouldn’t make my list of 100 things to consider in the search for a cure," he said. "There are so many more interesting things to look into without having to look into cross-reactions with goats." Nonetheless, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases did support research into CAEV’s vaccine potential in the 2000s before determining that it wasn’t viable. Currently, there’s a team of scientists at Joseph Fourier University in Grenoble, France, working on a CAEV-based HIV vaccine. Yahia Chebloune, one of the immunologists on the team, explained the concept to us. The team’s vaccine prototype combines CAEV with HIV and SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus). Unlike HIV, CAEV doesn’t destroy T helper cells — the white blood cells essential to the immune system — nor does it replicate as aggressively and indefinitely or create an AIDS-like disease in goats. So when the vaccine was tested on mice, macaques and llamas, their T helper cells weren’t destroyed and the animals could produce antibodies, suggesting that the vaccine was effective in stopping the HIV strains from replicating. Got goat milk None of this suggests that Chachoua has successfully cured Sheen or the 780,000 inhabitants of Comoros against HIV. Simply "drinking milk from goats with arthritis" cannot protect anyone from the virus. CAEV is not transmittable to humans, so Charlie Sheen couldn’t have developed CAEV antibodies — even if they did "destroy" HIV (again, they don't). "This is the craziest story I’ve ever heard," said Chebloune. "The claims of Dr. Sam Chachoua are not scientifically serious." Is it possible that Chachoua inoculated Sheen with a homemade CAEV-based vaccine like Chebloune’s? Our multiple requests for comment went unanswered so we’ll never know for sure. But the one CAEV vaccine prototype we found triggered an immune response in animals and has yet to be tested on humans. What’s more, as Lawrence of amfAR noted, vaccinating someone against a disease is not the same thing as curing it. Then there’s the most damning evidence against Chachou: Sheen is still HIV-positive, while there were 7,900 HIV cases in Comoros in 2012. "I’m not cured, no," Sheen said on Feb. 11’s Dr. Oz. Salvator Niyonzima, who directs the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS in Comoros, told Oz that he and his colleagues "have never heard of Dr. Samir Chachoua." Our ruling Chachoua said he cured Charlie Sheen and Comoros of HIV with "milk from goats which had arthritis." Chachoua is taking a nugget of science and twisting into an absurd claim. There is no proof that CAEV — a relative of HIV that’s studied for its vaccine potential — neutralizes HIV. Sheen and people on the island of Comoros both have HIV.

pomt-03133	Newark is "now home to one-third of all commercial and multi-family development."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/sep/15/cory-booker/cory-booker-claims-newark-represents-third-real-es/	Editor’s Note: On March 14, 2013, PolitiFact New Jersey rated as Mostly True a statement by Newark Mayor Cory Booker that "More than 30 percent of all commercial and multifamily development in the entire state is happening in Newark." We based that ruling on building permit and square footage data provided by the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, a real-estate development firm that compiled numbers for the Booker administration and experts in the real-estate development industry. Booker, now a candidate in an Oct. 16 special election for the late Frank Lautenberg’s U.S. Senate seat, made the claim again in a form e-mail campaign letter distributed last week. In reanalyzing the claim, we realized that our first ruling didn’t take fully into account how Newark compares statewide in terms of building permits and value of new construction. This fact-check adds that analysis and consequently changes the ruling to Half True. With about a month to go before a special election for a vacant U.S. Senate seat, Democrat Cory Booker is using a Newark statistic to bolster support for his campaign. Booker, Newark’s mayor, cited the Brick City’s real estate growth in a Senate campaign form e-mail received last week by PolitiFact.com. Newark is "now home to one-third of all commercial and multi-family development," said Booker, whose challenger in the Oct. 16 special election is Republican Steve Lonegan, a former mayor of Bogota. That’s quite a claim to make, considering New Jersey has 21 counties and 566 municipalities. But after analyzing this claim, it’s clear the statistic only holds up when measured a particular way. First, let’s explain how real estate growth is measured before we delve into Newark’s numbers. Generally speaking, experts have told PolitiFact New Jersey that the real estate industry standard is to measure residential growth in building permits issued and commercial development in square footage. Why? The barometer for growth in residential real estate is number of units, which is tracked by building permits. That shows demand for households, said Rosemary Scanlon, divisional dean at the New York University Schack Institute of Real Estate and a former chief economist for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. But size matters more in commercial real estate because space can be made to fit the needs of firms moving in, and it’s also an economic indicator of business activity in the community, said Ken Danter, CEO of the Danter Company, a real estate research and consulting firm based in Columbus, Ohio. New Jersey’s Department of Community Affairs, however, tracks data by building permits because permits show "the beginning of the process," said John Lago, the DCA’s housing research manager. "If you’re mixing standards, it’s like mixing centigrade and fahrenheit," Lago said. There’s nothing technically wrong with using one measure for all real estate growth, but it’s not exactly conventional, Scanlon explained. Danter said he wouldn’t mix the two. So it’s clear that there are differing opinions about mixing building permits with square footage to measure growth. Now let’s look at Newark’s numbers. Booker’s city administration shared with us numbers crunched for the mayor by real estate development firm Jones Lang LaSalle, which used a database known as CoStar. Adam Zipkin, Booker’s deputy mayor for economic development, said those developments were measured in square footage. For 2012, New Jersey had projects under construction totaling 3,306,551 square feet. Of that, Newark was responsible for projects totaling 1,168,793 square feet – or 35.3 percent of the state real estate development total, according to the data. So based strictly on square footage, Booker is correct that Newark represents 30 percent of the real estate development going on statewide. But the number is significantly different if we look at building permits and the value of new construction for every municipality in the state. In that case, Newark ranked second for 2012, at $276,225,281, according to DCA data. Jersey City ranked first, at $391,016,932. The total value of new construction statewide in 2012, including state buildings, was $10,941,709,996. By that measure, Newark accounted for just 3 percent of the value of new construction statewide. Our ruling Booker said in a campaign e-mail, Newark is "now home to one-third of all commercial and multi-family development." Data from a real estate development firm compiling statistics for Booker showed that in terms of square footage, Newark accounted for 35 percent – or a bit more than a third -- of the residential and commercial real estate growth last year in New Jersey. So he’s right on that point. But in terms of building permits and value of new construction, Newark can claim just 3 percent of that total. Given that point, the ruling is Half True.

pomt-01157	The federal budget bill "reauthorizes the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, which provides taxpayer dollars so that the Four Seasons hotel can build a resort in Turkey."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/dec/15/michael-needham/cromnibus-includes-taxpayer-funding-four-seasons-h/	Saturday night, Congress approved a $1.1 trillion spending bill to fund the government through September. It passed with bipartisan support, but not without criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. On Fox News Sunday Dec. 14, Michael Needham, CEO of conservative activist group Heritage Action, said he was disappointed that Congress approved such a massive spending bill, with what he sees as irresponsible provisions. "They put forth one of the worst pieces of legislation," Needham said. "A $1.1 trillion spending bill that has a carve out for Blue Cross Blue Shield, has a carve out for Wall Street. Reauthorizes something called the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, which provides taxpayer-backed loans so that the Four Seasons Hotel can build a resort in Turkey." We were curious about the last part of Needham’s claim -- that the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), a government institution, financed a Four Seasons hotel in Turkey. When we reached out to Needham, his communications team told us that he misspoke -- he meant to say Ritz-Carlton, not the Four Seasons. We consider that to be a minor error that doesn’t distort Needham’s point because both are luxury hotels. That flub aside, we found that Needham’s claim is on target. It is, however, a narrow portrayal of what OPIC does. The hotel in Istanbul (not Constantinople) What’s OPIC? It’s a finance institution run by the federal government. Like a bank, it finances loans with interest and offers political risk insurance. What separates OPIC from other finance institutions, though, is that it helps American businesses break into developing economies -- places where a business might struggle to find private investment locally. For example, OPIC likely wouldn’t back a project in a wealthy country like Austria, where there is plenty of capital available. They would be much more likely to back a project in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2013, OPIC lent $3.75 billion, according to a press release. For 37 consecutive years, the agency has generated a net income for the United States Treasury by collecting interest off its loans and insurance premiums. Supporters say OPIC fosters economic growth in developing nations and benefits American businesses. Opponents, such as Needham, see OPIC as corporate welfare and misuse of tax dollars. In 2000, OPIC gave the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company a $50 million loan to open a hotel in Turkey, which is the project Needham was talking about. (The Four Seasons, we should note, does have a luxury hotel in Istanbul, but OPIC did not finance it.) According to annual reports, OPIC regularly finances hotels and tourism -- in addition to an array of other industries such as manufacturing, renewable energy and agriculture. In 2013, OPIC financed construction of a hotel in South Sudan, as well as hotel expansions in Armenia and the nation of Georgia. Since 2000, the organization has also financed hotels in Iraq, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Liberia, Guatemala, South Africa and more. OPIC spokesman Charles Stadtlander told PolitiFact that the Ritz-Carlton in Turkey is "well on its way to paying its loan back with interest." Stadtlander said, though, that Needham mischaracterized the hotel by calling it a "resort." He said it is a business-oriented hotel that was built with the idea in mind of bringing CEOs, foreign ministers and investors to Turkey, keeping with OPIC’s economic development mission. The hotel is an "essential piece of business infrastructure," Stadtlander said. Our ruling Needham said OPIC "provides taxpayer-backed loans so that the Four Seasons hotel can build a resort in Turkey." The Ritz-Carlton, not the Four Seasons, received a $50 million OPIC loan to build a hotel in Istanbul in 2000. While Needham got the name of the hotel chain wrong, we think most people would forgive mixing up two high-end hoteliers. That said, talking about building hotels overseas doesn’t give the full picture of what OPIC does. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-06069	"We haven't had any legislation which took away one gun in the past 20 years from anybody in this country--not one."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jan/09/bill-pascrell/bill-pascrell-claims-no-legislation-has-taken-guns/	There’s another gun battle heating up in Congress that not only divides politicians on the right to bear arms, but to carry them across state lines without penalty. And New Jersey Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-8th Dist.) doesn’t want that to happen. During a Nov. 16 House hearing, Pascrell spoke against the proposed National Right-To-Carry Reciprocity Act of 2011. If H.R. 822 becomes law, states that allow people to carry concealed weapons would be required to recognize other states’ valid concealed carry permits. At least 40 states already have some form of reciprocity for out-of-state concealed carry permits. The bill has been referred in the Senate to the Committee on the Judiciary. In opposing the bill, Pascrell said, "We haven't had any legislation which took away one gun in the past 20 years from anybody in this country -- not one." Pascrell’s spokesman, Paul Brubaker said the congressman was specifically referring to federal legislation, noting that his "point would have beeen clearer had he specified that he was referring to nonviolent, law-abiding gun owners." PolitiFact New Jersey found Pascrell’s argument somewhat on target. But two gun-rights organizations we spoke with say two laws do take guns from people. Larry Pratt, executive director of Virginia-based Gun Owners of America, and Joe Waldron, legislative director for the Washington state-based Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, both said a provision of The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 banned semiautomatic weapons with detachable devices. That, in effect, takes a weapon away from someone who wants it, they said. Brubaker disagreed. "The 1994 federal assault weapons ban prohibited for 10 years the possession, transfer, and manufacturing of semiautomatic assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition feeding devices," Brubaker said in an email. "However, there was a grandfather clause in the bill, and semiautomatic assault weapons that were legally-owned before the ban went into effect were NOT restricted. Those weapons could be transferred and sold within the confines of federal and state laws. … Neither the assault weapons ban, nor any federal prohibition of particular guns from being imported, resulted in the federal government taking legally-owned guns away from Americans." Waldron also pointed to The Domestic Violence Gun Ban, more commonly called the Lautenberg Amendment for its author, Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ). The amendment to the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997 bans anyone convicted of a misdemeanor domestic violence offense from owning or possessing a firearm, even if the person had it before the conviction. The law requires that person to immediately surrender the weapon – but not necessarily to law enforcement. That person’s gun and ammunition should be transferred to a "third party who may lawfully receive and possess them, such as their attorney, a local police agency, or a federal firearms dealer. In addition, such firearms and ammunition are subject to seizure and forfeiture," according to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives website. The result of the Lautenberg Amendment "is that people have been disarmed of weapons within the past 20 years and they’ve been sent to prison when they’ve been caught in possession," Waldron said. The consequences of one’s actions are central to the issue, according to ATF spokesperson Ginger Colbrun. As an example, she said that if a gun owner is convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence, the person’s actions are to blame for him no longer being allowed to possess a weapon -- not the law. "It really is semantics when you look at it," she said. But the person still has to give up the gun and to some, that's taking it away. Our ruling Pascrell said there hasn’t been any legislation in the past 20 years that took a gun from anyone in the United States. Gun advocates disagree, pointing to the federal crime bill and the Lautenberg Amendment as examples. But the facts are a gun can't be taken from someone who never had it, and having to surrender a gun because of a misdemeanor domestic violence conviction can be construed as it being taken away. We rate Pascrell’s claim Half True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com. Editor's Note: This story was initially published by accident with a Mostly True ruling. The correct ruling is Half True.

pomt-05639	The RESTORE Act started as an "effort to dedicate as much BP fine money as possible towards Gulf Coast restoration" but now "could steer money to places like the Great Lakes and West Coast."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/mar/22/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-oil-spill-fine-money-great-lakes/	A year after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, Florida’s two senators -- Republican Marco Rubio and Democrat Bill Nelson -- joined forces to support the RESTORE Act, a bipartisan effort to direct money from BP fines to Florida and other Gulf states affected by the 2010 oil spill. But when the bill reached the Senate floor March 8 for a key vote, Rubio voted "no." Why the change of heart? Rubio said the bill that passed the Senate was "far different" than the one he supported in July. "What started as a genuine bipartisan effort to dedicate as much BP fine money as possible towards Gulf Coast restoration has now turned into a raw deal that increases taxes, creates a new environmental bureaucracy, and could steer money to places like the Great Lakes and West Coast that had nothing to do with the oil spill," Rubio said. "This is no longer a Gulf Coast restoration bill, it’s a federal power grab that exploits the BP spill to pay for special interest projects driven by the usual 'what's in it for me' Washington mentality," he said. "I will not support raising taxes to pay for BP’s mess or to pay for new spending projects across the country that have nothing to do with Gulf Coast restoration." Rubio’s vote attracted attention because he was the only Gulf Coast senator to oppose the bill, and because a poll showed the vast majority of Floridians -- including Republicans and tea party supporters -- were in favor of the RESTORE Act. Was Rubio correct to imply that states such as Michigan or California could get money related to the oil spill across the country? We decided to check it out. The RESTORE Act The RESTORE Act stands for the Resources and Ecosystems Sustainability, Tourism Opportunities and Revived Economies. It was introduced in July 2011 by Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., and was cosponsored by Rubio, Nelson and other senators. The legislation directs 80 percent of the fines in connection with the Deepwater Horizon explosion to go to Gulf Coast projects, and the remainder to the U.S. Treasury. In the Gulf, the money could be used for mitigating damage to wildlife, monitoring fisheries, promoting tourism and job creation. The fines could hit $20 billion. On Sept. 21, the Senate’s committee on Environment and Public Works agreed to add an amendment that would create the National Endowment for the Oceans, a separate project which had stalled after being proposed in July 2010. Rubio is not a member of that committee. As the title suggests, the endowment is a national program with money available for coastal areas including -- you guessed it -- the Great Lakes and West Coast among other places. Environmentalists applauded that addition. "We had the largest ecosystem damaging disaster we ever had," said Brian Moore, legislative director at National Audubon. "Wouldn’t it be a good idea to divert a small portion of that to study the health of all our oceans and large bodies of water?" That "small portion" for the ocean endowment refers to half of the interest from the oil spill fine, not the fine itself. It’s impossible to predict what portion could go to the Great Lakes or West Coast, said Emily Woglom, director of government relations at the Ocean Conservancy. "It will be driven by merits of proposals, and regardless, we are likely talking about millions of dollars for ocean endowment as compared to billions of dollars for the gulf restoration fund," she said. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the RESTORE Act could fund an endowment of $138 million by 2021 for both the ocean endowment and the Gulf of Mexico. On Feb. 15, 2012, Nelson submitted an amendment to the transportation bill in the Senate that included the version of the RESTORE Act with the oceans provision. Rubio was a cosponsor. On March 7, Nelson submitted the amendment again, but Rubio was no longer a cosponsor. On March 8, the Senate passed the amendment 76-22, prompting Rubio’s protest. The Senate passed the full transportation bill March 14 again by 76-22 with Rubio again voting "no." Rubio’s "no" vote on the RESTORE Act puzzled some its supporters: Why didn’t he speak up publicly earlier? Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said that on the original bill that "we made clear on a staff level that Sen. Rubio wouldn’t support the National Endowment for Oceans. … We were hoping the final bill would not include that and (Rubio would) be able to support it." The ocean endowment wasn’t the only part that bothered Rubio. He explained his vote in more detail in an editorial, and he included criticism of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, an existing fund that uses fees from oil and gas leasing in federal waters to purchase and protect land. Language was added to the RESTORE Act to allow the conservation fund to get a boost in money. Woglom of the Ocean Conservancy said that technically the conservation fund isn’t getting BP fine money, but that the RESTORE Act and the Conservation Fund are sharing an offset to cover the increase in spending. Under pay-go budget rules, any change has to be accounted as new spending even if it comes from fines, and therefore needs an offset. The offset comes out of money generated by a delay in an interest rate adjustment for business investment. Anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist called that a tax increase. Rubio signed Norquist’s tax pledge in 2009, and if Rubio had voted for the RESTORE Act, Norquist could make the case that Rubio had violated his pledge. Moore, who favors the Land and Conservation Fund, said that isn’t a tax increase -- it extends an existing statute that makes businesses that make a profit overseas continue to pay a tax. RESTORE had not made it into law as of March 20, 2012, because the House had not passed a full transportation bill. The House version of RESTORE doesn’t include the oceans endowment, so the two chambers will need to resolve their differences. Our ruling Rubio said the RESTORE Act started as an "effort to dedicate as much BP fine money as possible towards Gulf Coast restoration" but now "could steer money to places like the Great Lakes and West Coast." It's not the fine money itself that could go to other bodies of water, but interest from the fines. Half the interest could go to an ocean endowment for coastal regions nationwide, including the Great Lakes and West Coast. The bulk of the fines themselves will still go to the Gulf Coast. The small amount was set aside to attract votes from non-Gulf senators. And in fact, the legislation passed the Senate by a wide enough margin to guarantee that Rubio’s home state will get the money and still allow him to say he voted against tax increases. Publicly, Rubio was quiet about the provision to protect other bodies of water for months, though we are rating him here on the truthfulness of his words, not the timing of his protest. Some money from the RESTORE Act could go to the Great Lakes and the West Coast, but the bulk of the money -- particularly the fines themselves -- would still go to the Gulf Coast. We rate his claim Half True.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2012-03-22T18:04:30	2012-03-08	['Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States', 'BP']
pomt-07484	A Republican proposal changes Medicare for those under age 55 so that they will "participate in the same kind of health plan that members of Congress do."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/13/mike-pence/mike-pence-said-republican-medicare-proposal-will-/	Correction: This item was originally published at about noon on April 13, 2011, based on ABC's transcript of "This Week With Christiane Amanpour." Shortly afterward, Pence's press office notified us that the transcript text was wrong -- leaving out the words "kind of." Listening to the exchange on video, we confirmed the error in our original ruling. As a result, we are republishing this item at about 6 p.m. on April 13 with the correct quote from Pence and have upgraded the ruling from False to Barely True. Republicans have better proposals than Democrats to rein in future federal spending, said Rep. Mike Pence, R-Ind., in an appearance on ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour. "House Republicans under Paul Ryan's leadership have offered a vision to put America back on a pathway toward a balanced budget," Pence said. "It deals with issues in entitlements. It reduces the national debt. For Americans 55 or older, we're not proposing a single change in Medicare... What we want to do for Americans under the age of 55 is make sure they can participate in the same kind of health plan that members of Congress do." Pence’s final claim about Medicare drew a response from Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., who was also on the show. "That is not accurate," Van Hollen said. "Members of Congress have what is called a fair-share deal. We do not bear the entire risk of increased costs. They are asking seniors to bear risks (that) they are not asking themselves." Pence replied, "Members of Congress have the same premium support system, Chris knows that." We decided to see who was right by fact-checking Pence’s statement that future Medicare beneficiaries will be able to "participate in the same kind of health plan that members of Congress do." The Medicare proposal Pence and Van Hollen mentioned comes from Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., chair of the House Budget Committee. His 2012 budget proposal, called The Path to Prosperity: Restoring America’s Promise, lays out many ways to reduce federal spending, including changes to entitlement programs including Medicare, the government-run health insurance program for Americans 65 or older. Right now, Medicare is a single-payer plan: The government pays doctors and hospitals set fees for the care Medicare beneficiaries receive. (Beneficiaries contribute premiums, and active workers contribute payroll taxes.) Under Ryan’s plan, people who are not yet 55 would not receive traditional Medicare, but would instead qualify for government "premium support" to help them buy health insurance from a private company starting in 2022. (Ryan’s plan specifically says this is not a "voucher" program, since the government will pay the insurance companies directly.) Premium supports would be higher for people who require more health care. Here’s how Ryan’s plan explains it: "When younger workers become eligible for Medicare, they will be able to choose from a list of guaranteed coverage options, enjoying the same kind of choices in their plans that members of Congress enjoy today. Medicare would then provide a payment to subsidize the cost of the plan. In addition, Medicare will provide increased assistance for lower-income beneficiaries and those with greater health risks." Ryan’s proposal requires the private insurance companies to accept all comers and to charge the same rate for people who are the same age. The plans would have to comply with a standard for benefits set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which administers the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, which is how members of Congress buy their insurance. Additionally, Ryan’s plan gradually raises the Medicare eligibility age to 67, and it provides smaller premium supports to high earners. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analyzed Ryan’s proposal and found that it will save the government money. But it does so by asking future Medicare beneficiaries to pay more to buy insurance. "A private health insurance plan covering the standardized benefit would, CBO estimates, be more expensive currently than traditional Medicare. Both administrative costs (including profits) and payment rates to providers are higher for private plans than for Medicare," the CBO concluded. Now let’s look at how whether proposal looks like what members of Congress can buy. • How the plan is like what members of Congress get. We contacted Pence’s office to ask about how the Ryan proposal is like what members of Congress get, and they pointed us to the fact that Medicare plans from private insurers will be required to comply with a benefits standard set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, as do plans that cover members of Congress. We should also note that seniors would be able to compare different plans and select from different insurance options, as members of Congress do. The government would pay part of premiums, as it does for members of Congress. • How the plan is not like what members of Congress get. First, the plans would be created specifically for Medicare beneficiaries on newly created Medicare health insurance exchanges. (Exchanges are virtual marketplaces where people can shop for insurance.) Second, as Van Hollen pointed out, members of Congress are protected somewhat when health insurance companies raise their rates, through a formula he mentioned known as "Fair Share." Generally speaking, the government pays for 75 percent of the average of the health insurance plans it offers. If the overall plans increase in price, the government still pays 75 percent. Federal support for premiums in Ryan’s plan, though, would not keep pace with medical inflation. Premium support instead would be pegged to the consumer price index, which historically lags health care costs. Our final point on how the plans differ may seem obvious to some, but we feel it’s important to mention: Members of Congress receive employer-based insurance. By definition, that means they receive a salary to help pay for their insurance. The base pay for members of Congress is currently $174,000. Medicare beneficiaries, on the other hand, tend to make a lot less money, because most of them are retired. The median income for Medicare beneficiaries was $20,644 in 2010. And only 5 percent had incomes exceeding $82,695, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. "As policymakers consider options for decreasing federal Medicare spending and addressing the federal debt and deficit, this analysis raises questions about the extent to which the next generation of Medicare beneficiaries will be able to bear a larger share of costs," the foundation concluded in an April 2011 report. Our ruling We should emphasize that Ryan’s Medicare proposal is only a broad outline right now, and there are many unanswered questions about it. But what we do know about it strikes us as fundamentally different from the kind of employer-provided health insurance that members of Congress receive. At a minimum, the premium supports will not keep pace with the historic record of rapidly increasing health care costs. Additionally, seniors make significantly less income than members of Congress and will likely not have the same options to buy more expensive plans. And, finally, they will not the same protection against rising costs that "Fair Share" provides members of Congress. We rate Pence’s statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.

pomt-07284	The U.S. has "over $62 trillion in unfunded liabilities."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2011/may/23/frank-wolf/rep-frank-wolf-says-us-has-over-62-trillion-unfund/	Weeks ago, when credit rating agency Standard & Poor’s downgraded its outlook for U.S. debt from "stable" to "negative," Rep. Frank R. Wolf, R-10th, was not surprised. "The warning flags are flying as we move closer and closer to the edge of the financial cliff," Wolf said in a statement on his website, pointing to his own previous alerts that the the nation’s mighty Triple-A credit rating was in jeopardy. Wolf called the downgrade a "predictable warning," adding: "I've been sounding a similar one for almost five years as I've tried to get the attention of Congress and the past and present administrations that America cannot continue on its current debt and deficit track, with over $14 trillion of debt, over $62 trillion in unfunded liabilities, and over one trillion dollar deficits projected for years to come," Wolf added. There’s one number in there that failed to ring a bell. We know the national debt is more than $14 trillion; in fact, we recently reached the debt limit of $14.3 trillion. It’s also true that future deficit projections -- under the current budget plan -- exceed $1 trillion annually. But is it true that the U.S. has more than $62 trillion in unfunded liabilities? We thought it was worth a look. For a source, Wolf’s office pointed to a 2010 report from the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, an organization devoted to public awareness of fiscal issues. The study contains a table entitled "Major Fiscal Exposure." A sum of $61.9 trillion is calculated for 2009, adding "explicit liabilities" (public debt, pensions, etc.) "commitments and contingencies" and "social insurance promises" (future social security benefits and future Medicare benefits). Predictably, the biggest driver of the staggering total is social insurance promises, which accounts for $45.8 trillion -- $38.2 trillion of which is future Medicare benefits. Social Security benefits account for the rest. As noted in fine print, the projections come from the Social Security and Medicare Trustees reports dated Jan. 1, 2009, and estimate benefits over the next 75 years. The rest of the data comes from the U.S. Treasury’s 2009 report. First, there’s an issue of terminology. "Technically, Mr. Wolf is in error because he calls the shortfalls in Social Security and Medicare ‘unfunded liabilities’" said J.D. Foster, an economist with the right-leaning Heritage Foundation. "Legally, they are not liabilities. They can be referred to accurately as promises or obligations." Foster said the benefits do not qualify as liabilities because "Congress can at any time reduce or alter them. In contrast, state pension plans are contractual labor arrangements that are liabilities because they are legally enforceable." Gary Burtless, an economist with the left-leaning Brookings Institution, agreed, calling the idea that the government "owes" trillions of dollars to future citizens from a variety of programs under rules that are currently in effect "ridiculous." "The Supreme Court has ruled that the U.S.A. does not have a contractual obligation to pay Social Security and Medicare under rules that Congress has no power to change," Burtless said in an email. "No citizen can expect to win a lawsuit that demands that benefits be paid that are as generous as the benefits that were ‘promised’ under some old, presumably more generous set of rules." Nevertheless, we’ll limit the Truth-O-Meter point reductions on this point because the Peterson Foundation report and media reports we found refer to the future Social Security and Medicare benefits as "liabilities" rather than "obligations." The next problem is less debatable: the information is outdated. According to the latest Medicare and Social Security trustees reports, the numbers have changed significantly since 2009. Promised Medicare benefits for the next 75 years now total $24.6 trillion, according to 2011 numbers, and Social Security benefits have increased to $9.2 trillion. So Medicare obligations are now $13.6 trillion less than the data upon which Wolf based his claim , largely due to the health care reform act passed last year. Social Security obligations are $1.5 trillion trillion more. The net effect of those changes is that projections for future obligations are $12 trillion less than the 2009 data Wolf uses. But the trustees reports for this year hadn’t been released when Wolf made his claim, so we must look at the 2010 reports. Last year’s projections showed Medicare obligations to be $22.78 trillion over the 75 years and Social Security at $7.95 trillion for a total of $30.73 trillion. Using that comparison, Wolf’s off by even more, $15 trillion. And of course the debt has also changed. In the report Wolf cites, the publicly-held debt -- U.S. bonds held by individuals, institutions and foreign nations -- is listed as $7.6 trillion. On the day he issued his statement, it was $9.7 trillion. So add $2.1 trillion back and he’s off by almost $13 trillion. Other numbers have changed, too, but you get the point: The 2009 estimate was not a safe number in April 2011. Others argue that estimating unfunded obligations 75 years into the future is never safe. "One can certainly come up with all kinds of scary – but essentially meaningless – estimates of the ‘unfunded liability’ of the federal government’s programs," Burtless, the Brookings economist, said. "As a general rule of thumb, the bigger the estimate, the more meaningless it is." Burtless noted that the numbers change wildly based on annual policy decisions and a 75-year measure was is arbitrary because obligation don’t end then. "It is impossible to predict 25 years into the future with much accuracy, let alone 75 years or all of eternity," he said. So let’s review. Wolf claims that the U.S. faces "over $62 trillion in unfunded liabilities." First, he and many others misuse the term "unfunded liabilities" to describe the future costs of government promises. Unlike a home mortgage, the U.S. is not locked into paying a certain amount based on existing terms. In fact, Congress changes the terms all the time. Secondly, the numbers Wolf based his claim on are badly outdated. In fact, using the 75-year estimates he cites, the figure would be significantly lower than $62 trillion based on 2011 figures. So, while Wolf’s claim is based on an actual figure, it’s an old one that was shaky to begin with given the distant projection and likelihood of change. We rate his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04827	Says Paul Ryan "wants to cut Pell Grant scholarships for nearly 10 million students."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/aug/16/eva-longoria/desperate-housewives-actress-obama-activist-says-p/	On the day Mitt Romney named U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan as his running mate, actress Eva Longoria fired off a series of Twitter attacks on the presumptive Republican presidential ticket. The Aug. 11, 2012 tweets by Longoria, who describes herself as an activist as well as an actress, included this one: "Today Mitt Romney picked Paul Ryan, who wants to cut Pell Grant scholarships for nearly 10 million students!" Longoria is no politician, but she is political, serving as a national co-chair of President Barack Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign. Known for her role as Gabrielle Solis on the TV series "Desperate Housewives," Longoria has appeared at Obama campaign events since being chosen to one of the 35 largely ceremonial co-chair posts. At a Denver rally in July 2012, she told Obama supporters: "We have to get out there and tell (others) ‘If you’re a woman, there is no way you can vote Republican.’" But what about financially needy college students? How would Ryan’s plan affect them? Longoria’s evidence Longoria’s tweet about Ryan and student aid included a link to a page on Obama’s campaign website focused on Romney and Ryan. (So did a tweet nearly identical to Longoria’s made the same day by actress Ashley Judd.) The page slams a budget proposal Ryan made as chairman of the House Budget Committee. "To pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest," the Ryan plan would, among other things, cut "Pell Grant scholarships for nearly 10 million students," the Obama campaign says. So, we know where Longoria got the information for her tweet. But the site doesn’t provide any evidence that would back the claim. Fortunately, our colleagues at PolitiFact National evaluated a similar statement made by Obama himself in April 2012, a few days after the GOP-controlled House approved Ryan’s budget resolution. (The plan didn't pass in the Democratic-controlled Senate.) Obama said that if spending reductions in the resolution "were to be spread out evenly," nearly 10 million college students would see their financial aid cut by an average of more than $1,000 each. The White House told our colleagues the president was referring to the Pell Grant program. So, Ryan's plan does not specify cuts to Pell Grants. Obama is simply applying the total spending cuts in the plan evenly across the overall budget to derive a Pell Grant number. Dissecting Obama’s claim Let’s look at what PolitiFact National found in evaluating Obama’s statement: Federal Pell Grants provide the largest source of grant funding for needy college students (although Ryan contends the grants should be targeted more to lower-income students). More than 9.7 million students are expected to get grants in 2013, according to the U.S. Education Department. By the president’s calculation, applying the Ryan budget cuts evenly would reduce the maximum Pell grant -- $5,500 for the 2011-2012 school year -- to $4,595, leaving some students with nothing at all and cutting grants for nearly 10 million students by an average of more than $1,000 per student. Budget experts said that because the Ryan spending cuts lacked detail, it was fair for Obama to assume the cuts would be applied evenly. But Obama himself acknowledged that Republicans hadn’t specified the Pell cuts themselves and that they might apply cuts in ways other than he assumed. Indeed, the Ryan plan budget resolution -- which is a guidance document, not a line-by-line budget -- doesn’t mention Pell grant funding; and any funding cuts would be made by House committees. Moreover, a House Budget Committee report accompanying Ryan’s budget resolution suggested the maximum Pell grant remain at $5,500, contradictory to Obama’s claim. Our colleagues concluded that Obama’s statement was accurate using his set of assumptions, but his assumptions ignored what House Republicans said was a preference that Pell grant maximums not be reduced. Obama’s claim was rated Half True. FactCheck.org also looked at Pell Grants and Ryan’s plan. The University of Pennsylvania-based fact checkers concluded"it is certainly true that Ryan’s budget would require deep spending cuts," but "it is hard to know what impact Ryan’s budget would have on specific programs because the plan contains so few details." We also sought input from Gillian Morris, spokeswoman for Obama’s campaign in Wisconsin, and Kevin Seifert, campaign manager for Ryan, who remains on the November 2012 ballot for his House seat. Obama’s campaign cited an April 2012 opinion column by The New York Times’ Paul Krugman, which claims without evidence that 1 million students would lose Pell grants altogether. But that wasn’t Obama’s or Longoria’s claim. The campaign also provided a March 2012 blog post by Obama’s Office of Management and Budget director, but it uses the same assumptions the president did in his claim. Ryan’s plan would make fewer students eligible for Pell money, according to an article in the conservative National Review cited by Ryan’s spokesman. But while bringing Pell spending "under control," the budget would nevertheless maintain the maximum Pell grant at $5,500, Ryan wrote in response to criticism of his plan. Our rating Longoria said Ryan "wants to cut Pell Grant scholarships for nearly 10 million students." Her claim is slightly different than one made by Obama, who arrived at his 10 million figure by assuming spending cuts called for in Ryan's budget plan would be made uniformly across federal programs. Nevertheless, she uses Obama's methodology in making her claim. We’re giving Longoria the same rating Obama got for making a claim that is partially accurate but leaves out important details -- Half True.

pomt-00001	"Nearly 200,000 Florida voters may not be citizens."	false	/florida/statements/2018/nov/13/donald-trump-jr/donald-trump-jrs-misleading-tweet-about-noncitizen/	As President Donald Trump floated baseless claims about fraud in the counting of ballots in Florida, his son chimed in on Twitter to imply that the state had a huge number of noncitizen voters. "Amazing, but not shocking at all anymore. Nearly 200,000 Florida Voters May Not Be Citizens https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/Nearly-200000-Florida-Voters-May-Not-Be-Citizens-151212725.html … via @nbc6," Donald Trump Jr. tweeted on Nov. 12. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com The tweet drew more than 28,000 likes in less than 24 hours. But it isn't accurate. It is based on a cherry-picked number from a headline that didn’t tell the full story back in 2012. At the outset of the state’s effort to purge noncitizens from the voter rolls, state officials came up with the list of about 182,000 names. But Trump Jr. omits that the final number of noncitizens purged was a tiny speck of that original number. When examined in the context of all the registered voters — or even ballots cast — in Florida or the nation, proven voter fraud by noncitizens is rare. History of noncitizen purge Florida engaged in a controversial attempt to search for noncitizen voters leading up to the 2012 election. The search was rife with errors, and was ultimately dropped after few were found. Shortly after Republican Gov. Rick Scott took office in 2011, he asked his top election official at the time to look into removing noncitizens from the voter rolls. By 2012, the Division of Elections put together a list of potential noncitizens based on driver’s license data. Trump cited a headline from early in that process. He linked to a May 2012 story on NBC Miami’s website headlined: "2012Election: Nearly 200,000 Florida Voters May Not Be Citizens." The story was written by the Associated Press. Why was the president’s son sharing a six-year-old story? Matthew Gertz of the liberal Media Matters website noted that before Trump Jr.’s tweet, conservative pundits publicized the 2012 story. David Wohl, the father of conspiracy theorist Jacob Wohl, tweeted a link to the story on Nov. 10, as did Harlan Hill and Charlie Kirk. On Nov. 12 before Trump Jr.’s tweet, NBC Miami included an editor’s note on top of the original story. First, it reminded readers that the story was published in 2012. Then, it went over the history lesson of how the state’s list contained errors: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The AP had reported that the initial list turned up nearly 182,000 people who may not be U.S. citizens, based on the driver’s license data. Of that group, the state sent an initial list of more than 2,600 voters’ names to county election supervisors. As we have reported and the NBC editor’s note points out, the state ultimately whitted the list and removed 85 voters because they were "not a U.S. citizen." Supervisors had noted all sorts of errors and later used words such as "sloppy" and "embarrassing" to describe the state initiative, PolitiFact found. One of the problems was that the driver’s license data doesn’t get updated when a legal resident later becomes a citizen. By September 2012, when the Division of Elections produced a new list of about 200 ineligible voters, supervisors were fed up, and the effort appeared to fizzle as the presidential election drew near. The state said it would launch yet another effort to purge noncitizens from the voter rolls almost a year later, but scrapped it. We were unable to find any other sort of comprehensive data on noncitizen voters removed in Florida. We reached out to the state Division of Elections but did not hear back by deadline. Jason Snead tracks proven instances of election fraud in the U.S. for the conservative Heritage Foundation, which includes cases that resulted in criminal convictions, fines or an official finding of fraud. He said the database shows 13 entries from Florida involving a noncitizen who successfully registered and/or voted in an election. These cases were from 2003-06. A May 2017 report by New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice found that election officials in 42 jurisdictions referred an estimated 30 incidents of suspected noncitizen voting for further investigation or prosecution out of more than 23 million votes. "The kind of instances in which an individual voter tries to pretend to be somebody else or votes when he or she isn’t eligible are not the statistically meaningful events that we need to be worried about," Myrna Pérez, director of the center’s Voting Rights and Elections project and co-author of the study, said to the Austin American-Statesman. Our ruling As Florida underwent a recount of three key races, Trump Jr. tweeted a headline that said "nearly 200,000 Florida voters may not be citizens." He said it was "amazing, but not shocking at all anymore." It’s actually not true, and years old. The story itself provides a more complete picture — and an editor’s note with clarifications that Trump overlooked. The state’s 2012 voter purge started with a list of potentially 182,000 noncitizens on the voter rolls. State officials whittled that list to more than 2,600 names sent to county election supervisors. Ultimately 85 noncitizens were removed. We rate this claim False.

pomt-06689	Says the federal government is "the largest energy user in the country."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/sep/07/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-says-us-government-nations-largest/	Ohio's Sen. Rob Portman is co-sponsor of the Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act, introduced in May, which aims to promote energy savings in residential and commercial buildings and industry through the use of energy-efficient technology, building codes and financial incentives. Portman says the bipartisan measure will help the economy, among other benefits, by increasing productivity and creating jobs. In an article written for the Toledo Blade, the first-term Republican said the legislation will also save millions of tax dollars because "it will require the federal government — the largest energy user in the country — to adopt energy-saving techniques." That stirred the curiosity of PolitiFact Ohio, if not our skepticism. Is the federal government really the country's biggest energy user? And -- drum roll -- how big is it? We asked Portman's office for background. Highlighting the bill's bipartisan support, they reached across the aisle and down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. President Obama, they noted, announced last year that the federal government would reduce its greenhouse gas pollution 28 percent by 2020, to "lead by example in building the clean energy economy." "As the largest energy consumer in the United States," the president said, "we have a responsibility to American citizens to reduce our energy use and become more efficient. Our goal is to lower costs, reduce pollution, and shift Federal energy expenses away from oil and towards local, clean energy." Showing how large a consumer it is, the White House said the government spent more than $24.5 billion on electricity and fuel in 2008 alone. Keep in mind, that does not pay simply for heating and cooling buildings in Washington. It includes the costs of fueling military jets, ships and vehicles. The Defense Department is the single biggest energy user in government. Kateri Callahan, president of the Alliance to Save Energy -- a coalition of business, government, environmental, and consumer leaders -- gave testimony to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee in support of Portman's bill in June. "Without the energy efficiency improvements we’ve made since 1973, we would need about 50 percent more energy to power today’s economy than we are currently using," she said, citing earlier federal efforts to reduce energy use and pollution. "As the nation's largest energy consumer," Callahan said, "it is critically important that the federal government lead by example." How large is largest? Callahan said the government accounted for 1.6 quadrillion BTUs of energy use in fiscal 2008, costing $24.5 billion. That use represented about 1.6 percent of the nation's energy consumption for the year, she said. The Alliance to Save Energy told us her source was the Federal Energy Management Program's annual report to Congress in January 2010. Portman's office provided the same report, which is based on data submitted by federal agencies to the Department of Energy. Its website has figures dating back to 1949. On the Truth-O-Meter, Portman’s statement rates as True.	None	Rob Portman	None	None	None	2011-09-07T06:00:00	2011-08-28	['None']
pomt-08147	"In 2009, Jim Doyle and the Democrats rushed through a budget repair bill with billions in tax increases and held no public hearings."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/dec/05/jeff-fitzgerald/jeff-fitzgerald-says-gov-jim-doyle-and-democrats-r/	One of the Republican leaders at the new-look Wisconsin statehouse thinks he knows exactly why voters ushered Democrats out the door in November -- they operated in secret and were careless with your tax dollars. So says state Rep. Jeff Fitzgerald (R-Horicon), the incoming Assembly speaker. In a Nov. 29, 2010 news release under the headline "Democrats continue closed-door deals," Fitzgerald warned against a possible December special session to approve labor deals with state employee unions before Republicans take control in January. He then reached back a year to portray a pattern of bad conduct: "In 2009, (Gov.) Jim Doyle and the Democrats rushed through a budget repair bill with billions in tax increases and held no public hearings." As devoted Madison watchers, that raised a few obvious questions: Were there really no hearings, not a one? And "billions" of tax hikes slipped into a bill meant to fix a mid-budget shortfall? In short: Is Fitzgerald rewriting history? When we asked Fitzgerald spokesman Jim Bender about the tax figure, he told us he erred in using "billions." Oops. The Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the official scorekeeper, estimated the repair bill would raise $290 million from tax changes. The main source was "combined reporting," in which lawmakers closed what some viewed as a loophole that allowed corporations to shuffle profits to subsidiaries in states that don’t tax them. If a new fee on hospital revenue was included, the new revenue total was $1.2 billion over three years, according to the fiscal bureau. That element features its own mini debate: The fiscal bureau calls the hospital assessment a fee. Media reports commonly referred to it as a tax. Hospitals backed the fee because it allowed the state to tap a large new stream of federal money that boosts Medicaid reimbursement to hospitals; Republicans derided it as a "sick tax" that would raise costs to patients. Bender told us he counted the hospital fees as a tax -- but mistakenly used "billions." "Normally, I use specifics, but in this instance generalized," he said. So, the underlying math in the statement is off -- by either $800 million or $1.71 billion, depending on how you view the hospital fee. But what about the way the bill was passed? It was pushed through the Legislature at warp speed -- two days -- when compared with four previous repair bills dating to 2002. The range on those was from 21 to 150 days. The speed was partly a function of the Democrats controlling both houses and the governor’s office. As for the lack of public hearings, Fitzgerald is right -- there were none. But a look into the past shows a spotty record on such hearings when it comes to budget repair bills -- with Republicans and Democrats both on the hook for blame or credit. We looked back at four such bills -- one in 2002 offered by Republican Gov. Scott McCallum -- and three earlier fixes under Doyle, a Democrat. Budget repair bills have become much more common in recent years as the economy sagged. On the earlier Doyle bills, the Legislature twice held public hearings. In one case, Republicans controlled both chambers; the parties shared control in the other. But in 2007, another year with split control, no public hearing accompanied the action. Under McCallum in 2002, lawmakers convened two such hearings on a highly contentious plan. The two parties split control at that time as well. Let’s consign this discussion to the dustbin of history. No matter how you add it up, Fitzgerald misfired badly on the tax figure he used in his news release slamming Democrats. His own aide admitted it. He is correct on the rushed nature of the 2009 budget fix. On the question of public hearings, Fitzgerald is right there were none -- but his rhetoric skipped past the fact such hearings have not always been held. Indeed, both parties have had a hand in that fact. We rate his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Jeff Fitzgerald	None	None	None	2010-12-05T09:00:00	2010-11-29	['Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Jim_Doyle']
pomt-13430	Says that Republican Darryl Glenn has described Democrats as "evil" and has said he's "tired of hearing about Republicans reaching across the aisle."	true	/colorado/statements/2016/sep/19/michael-bennet/bennet-glenn-said-democrats-are-evil-and-hes-tired/	During a U.S. Senate debate in Colorado, Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet said his Republican opponent, Darryl Glenn, has said that Democrats are "evil" and he's "tired of hearing about Republicans reaching across the aisle." The confrontation happened at the end of a Sept. 10 debate at the Club 20 forum in Grand Junction, where three opponents -- Bennett, Glenn and Libertarian candidate Lily Tang Williams -- were allowed to question opponents for three minutes. Bennet, who went last, saved his fire for Glenn, an El Paso County commissioner. "Over the course of this campaign you said, 'I don't know any elected Democrats I get along with.’ You said, 'I'm running against Democrats, I'm running against evil.’ And you said you're 'tired of hearing about Republicans reaching across the aisle,'" Bennet told Glenn. "Your policies and views, like privatizing the V.A. and calling for the elimination and defunding of all agencies like the Department of Education and also EPA and Energy, are far to the right of many Colorado Republicans. "How exactly would you get anything done (in Congress) and live up to your own standards?" Bennet asked. Glenn didn’t answer the question. Instead he countered that Bennet’s "idea of reaching across the aisle is supporting the Iran nuclear deal. His idea of reaching across the aisle is having Republicans support the Affordable Care Act when we already know the devastating impact that's happening to people. His idea of reaching across the aisle is supporting EPA standards that are going to result in over 1,200 jobs that are being lost here." (Watch the exchange at 01:07:00 in the video) In his rebuttal, Bennet said Glenn was wrong and highlighted his bipartisan collaboration on the No Child Left Behind education law and the 2013 immigration bill. In this fact-check, we examine Bennet’s claim that Glenn has described his fight against Democrats as "running against evil" and complained about fellow Republicans "reaching across the aisle." While Colorado -- like the rest of country -- has passionate political divisions, voters also want their elected leaders to work together for the betterment of the Centennial State. There are more registered independent voters in the state than Republicans or Democrats. Yet, with little money and a shoe-string campaign, Glenn won a surprise upset in a crowded Republican primary. Glenn has repeatedly said that Republicans and Democrats working together is what’s wrong with Congress. The Denver Post reported that a growing number of Republican strategists are concerned about Glenn's campaign strategy against Bennet and his apparent inability to reach beyond Republican voters. PolitiFact confirmed that Glenn made all the comments quoted by Bennet at the debate -- often repeating his disdain for Republicans who work with Democrats. The Bennet campaign turned a montage of Glenn’s edgy remarks into a video ad called, "Across the Aisle." Here's a sampling: "I'm running against the Democrats. I'm running against evil" -- Glenn at a North JeffCo Tea Party event, April 16, 2015. "I don't know any elected Democrats that I get along with" -- Glenn during a Republican U.S. Senate candidates debate on KUSA-TV, April 5, 2016. "I'm tired of Republicans complaining. I'm tired of Republicans wanting to just reach across the aisle. We need to stand up and lead" -- Glenn on KLZ-560 AM on April 11, 2016. Listen to his comments at 2:20 in the interview During a May 25 Republican Senate candidate primary debate on Colorado Public Television, Glenn rebuked a moderator who asked how he'd "work across party lines and try to find some consensus and some compromise" and "get something done" in a polarized Congress. "I think your question exemplifies what’s wrong with America and the frustration that's out there. You don't get it," Glenn replied. "The bottom line is it’s not about reaching across the aisle. The bottom line is...leadership. You need to actually have a leader to stand up there and represent the values of what's going on in this country." (Watch the exchange at 44:30 in this debate video.) We asked the Glenn campaign if he disputed the accuracy of the quotes cited by Bennet. They did not respond. Our ruling Bennet said that Republican Darryl Glenn has described Democrats as "evil" and has said he's "tired of hearing about Republicans reaching across the aisle." Glenn doesn't back away from his disdain for bipartisanship. He told a debate moderator who asked how he’d worked with Democrats to get something done in the Senate that "your question exemplifies what’s wrong with America." We rate the claim True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b98c08e5-9243-4da4-8104-dda8b40b9f62	None	Michael Bennet	None	None	None	2016-09-19T16:41:14	2016-09-10	['Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-14196	"Pennsylvania has lost 35 percent of its manufacturing jobs since 2001" and "Harrisburg has lost 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since 2001."	mostly true	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/apr/22/donald-trump/donald-trump-and-number-manufacturing-jobs-pennsyl/	Donald Trump focused a campaign rally in Harrisburg Thursday on bringing back manufacturing jobs to a state that’s lost more than many others in the past decade. The presidential frontrunner bolstered his point by telling thousands of supporters at the Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex: "Pennsylvania has lost 35 percent of its manufacturing jobs since 2001" and later added that Harrisburg, the state capital, "has lost 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since 2001." That seemed like a large percentage of jobs lost. So we decided to check the claim. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Pennsylvania lost nearly 300,000 manufacturing jobs since January 2001, decreasing from 856,200 to 564,900 in the span of 15 years. That correlates with a 34 percent decrease in jobs lost -- quite close to Trump’s 35 percent claim. However, the job loss in Harrisburg is off. The Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the Harrisburg metropolitan area had 30,500 manufacturing jobs in January 2001 and now is home to 21,400. That’s a decrease of 30 percent, not 40 percent as Trump claimed Thursday. His campaign didn’t respond to a request for comment. Trump was right when he told supporters in Harrisburg that Pennsylvania has been among the hardest hit in the country by a loss in manufacturing jobs. The Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank based in Washington, D.C., reported last year that eight states lost more than 200,000 manufacturing jobs since 1998 -- Pennsylvania came in seventh behind California, Ohio, North Carolina, New York, Michigan and Illinois. That job loss is significant for a state that, in 2013, employed 10 percent of its job force in the manufacturing sector and made 12 percent of its gross domestic product from the industry. Major hubs of manufacturing the state were, at one point, steel mills in western Pennsylvania, Bethlehem, and the shipyard in South Philadelphia. The size of those industries has largely decreased since their heyday. Kevin L. Kearns, president of the United States Business and Industry Council, a Washington, D.C.-based organization that represents mid-sized manufacturing companies, said manufacturing job loss since 2001 can be chalked up to globalization and the proliferation of the use of robotics in manufacturing. He said thousands of jobs were lost in the manufacturing sector to technology. But the companies his organization represented that shut down in the last decade didn’t do so because of technology -- they did it because other companies in their supply chain had outsourced to other countries. Kearns said the impact of manufacturing job loss has an impact on every corner of the Pennsylvania economy, as people who were once middle class are now either jobless or in other industries that may not pay as well, causing them to spend less in other ways. "In a generalized way, it means that people in Pennsylvania are earning less money," he said. "It has a massive footprint and a massive ripple effect." Our ruling In an attempt to show Pennsylvanians he would work to bring back jobs, Trump said "Pennsylvania has lost 35 percent of its manufacturing jobs since 2001" and "Harrisburg has lost 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since 2001." The figure about the statewide manufacturing job loss checks out, but his claim about Harrisburg losing 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since 2001 is off by about 10 percent.

pomt-10565	"I'm the only Republican who has gotten endorsements in this presidential race from major labor unions..."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/08/mike-huckabee/unions-gave-huck-their-gop-nod/	It's not often that we hear a Republican presidential candidate crowing about support from unions. "I'm the only Republican who has gotten endorsements in this presidential race from major labor unions, the international painters union as well as the machinists and aerospace workers — first time in over 100 years from either union," Huckabee said in a TV interview the day after Super Tuesday. Huckabee is correct on a few points here. Unions don't usually endorse Republican candidates, and they support Democratic candidates with contributions by margins of roughly 9 to 1, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. But this year, two unions decided to endorse candidates in the primaries for both parties: The International Union of Painters and Allied Trades with 160,000 members, and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers with 720,000 members. In the Democratic race, both unions endorsed Sen. Hillary Clinton, and in the Republican race, both endorsed Mike Huckabee. We called both unions and they confirmed the "100 years" statement because it's the first time they've endorsed Republican candidates since they formed more than 100 years ago. James Williams, head of the International Painters, said the union decided to endorse Republicans this year as a way of reflecting the sentiments of their Republican members, who make up about 30 percent of the union. The painters mailed out a ballot to more than 160,000 members and asked them to vote in each race and Huckabee was the GOP choice. Add to that the fact that some members live in heavily Republican areas and are represented by Republican elected officials, he said. The endorsement is a way of reaching out beyond the unions' usual Democratic allies. "The reality is that we have to work across the aisle with both Democrats and Republicans," Williams said. "It hasn't been done in the last seven years. But hopefully whoever is elected next will realize we can't have this polarization." Huckabee may have won the endorsements because he actively campaigned for them. He was the only Republican to attend the national convention of the machinists' union in August 2007. He also speaks regularly on the need for fair trade agreements and the problems of working men and women. Critics and supporters alike have described him as an "economic populist." Not that Huckabee's union record is flawless: Unions have criticized him for crossing picket lines of the Writers Guild of America to appear on late-night television shows, among other things. We searched for major union endorsements of any other Republican candidates and were unable to find one. A spokesperson with the AFL-CIO said the Huckabee endorsements were the only ones they knew of. There are a lot of unusual things about Huckabee, a bass guitar-playing, Chuck Norris-approved preacher. Add Republican and union-endorsed to that list. We find his statement True.

pomt-04110	Says if you are on your bike in a crosswalk, all you have to do is dip your wheel into the road and cars must legally stop.	true	/oregon/statements/2013/jan/11/bikeportlandorg/must-cars-stop-if-cyclist-dips-wheel-crosswalk/	During the 2011 legislative session, lawmakers were hard at work passing a law they said would make Oregon streets safer -- by changing crosswalk rules. Legislators decided to make it clear in Oregon law that a pedestrian was crossing the street -- and that cars should safely stop -- when any part of the pedestrian moved into a crosswalk with an intent to cross. That rule became law in summer 2011. Jonathan Maus, who runs the blog BikePortland.org, announced recently on Twitter that the new law applied to cyclists as well. After some research he concluded that, "If on your bike on sidewalk, all u have to do is dip wheel into road and cars must legally stop." Maus was specifically referring to crosswalks -- not just anywhere in the road. That becomes clear as you review his tweets and a blog post he wrote on the subject. "I was super confused," he said about the law when we called to ask about the tweets. "It's hard to tease out exactly ... especially on a bike. It's like a mutant vehicle." We wondered if that was an accurate reading of the relatively new law, so we called Sheila Lyons, the Oregon Department of Transportation’s Bicycle and Pedestrian Program manager. She pointed us toward ORS 811.028, the section affected by the new law. Specifically: "For the purposes of this section, a pedestrian is crossing the roadway in a crosswalk when any part or extension of the pedestrian, including but not limited to any part of the pedestrians [sic] body, wheelchair, cane, crutch or bicycle, moves onto the roadway in a crosswalk with the intent to proceed." Based on that, Maus seemed to be right, but we weren’t completely sold. We wondered whether it was legal for a bicyclist to ride a bike through a crosswalk. It seemed to us that they’d probably have to walk it. We asked Lyons about that, too. The answer was, it turned out, that cyclists can bike on sidewalks and in crosswalks. But there are caveats. Some urban cores prohibit cyclists from riding on sidewalks, so it’s important to note local rules. Perhaps more importantly, ORS 814.410says mounted cyclists are operating a bicycle unsafely on a sidewalk if they are moving "at a speed greater than an ordinary walk when approaching or entering a crosswalk." Basically, cyclists can ride in a crosswalk so long as they’re not moving faster than an ordinary walker. And yes, dipping a wheel into the crosswalk is enough for a person riding a bike to signal intent to cross. We called Ray Thomas, a Portland personal injury attorney who specializes in bike laws, to make sure we had this right. He said our reading of the laws was exactly as he understood them. He called the recent change "the Oregon pedestrian revolution" in that, legally speaking, pedestrians no longer need to enter the roadway completely to get a car to stop. Finally, we also talked to Oregon Sens. Jackie Dingfelder and Ginny Burdick, both of whom helped pass the crosswalk law. The Portland legislators confirmed that it was always their intent that the new law apply to slow-moving cyclists as well as pedestrians. Maus tweeted that the new law meant a cyclist could dip a tire into a crosswalk and cars would legally have to stop to permit crossing. We checked the laws ourselves, spoke with a lawyer and the legislators involved and found that Maus is correct. We rate this statement True.

pomt-05414	Says the stimulus bill sent tax credits overseas, such as "$1.2 billion to a solar company that's building a plant in Mexico."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/02/americans-prosperity/ad-says-stimulus-tax-credits-funded-solar-company-/	A TV ad running in eight states blames President Barack Obama for sending stimulus money overseas while Americans are out of work. "Tell President Obama, American tax dollars should help American taxpayers," the narrator says. Instead, $2.3 billion in tax credits funded jobs in Mexico, Finland and China, the ad claims. We checked all three examples — and found the ad incorrectly describes them all. (We've also checked many other exaggerations about the stimulus.) Americans for Prosperity, a group dedicated to "educating citizens about economic policy" that works closely with tea party activists and has been funded by the conservative Koch family, released the ad April 26, 2012. Here’s the string of claims, starting with an image of the president signing a bill: Washington promised to create American jobs. We passed their stimulus. But that's not what happened. Fact: Billions of taxpayer dollars spent on green energy went to jobs in foreign countries. The Obama administration admitted the truth, that $2.3 billion of tax credits went overseas, while millions of Americans can't find a job. $1.2 billion to a solar company that's building a plant in Mexico. Half a billion to an electric car company that created hundreds of jobs in Finland. And tens of millions of dollars to build traffic lights in China. Sounds like a scandal and an outrage. Is that what happened? For this fact-check, we’re focusing on whether "tax credits" that "went overseas" included "$1.2 billion to a solar company that's building a plant in Mexico." (In other fact-checks, we found the Finland claim False, and the China claim Mostly False.) The ad listed two sources for its Mexico claim, the Energy Department and PV Magazine. We tracked those down, then chatted with the companies involved. Two programs, two projects We’ll start with what’s true: An American solar company, SunPower, was approved for federal stimulus money. It also opened a solar panel plant in Mexico. (Or, rather, it moved its Mexican manufacturing from Chihuahua to a building it’s leasing in Mexicali, said company spokeswoman Natalie Wymer.) That’s where the claim’s relationship to the truth ends. • The company didn’t get tax credits, but a $1.2 billion loan guarantee. What’s the difference? The Energy Department expects the loan to be paid back — with interest. • That loan guarantee wasn’t for the Mexico plant — a separate project with its own funding — but to build the California Valley Solar Ranch in San Luis Obispo, Calif. Construction on the California project has already started, with the Energy Department projecting 350 construction jobs and 15 permanent ones. Pacific Gas & Electric Co., the state’s largest utility, will ultimately buy the power. • Most of the solar panels for the California project will come from SunPower’s California manufacturing facility in Milpitas, though given the size of the project, they’ll also come from the company’s plants in Mexico and Asia, Wymer said. • SunPower no longer owns the California Valley Solar Ranch project. The solar project — and the loan guarantee — belong to New Jersey company NRG Energy. That’s the company that will get the federal loan money, and be responsible for repaying taxpayers. Our ruling A TV ad from Americans for Prosperity says billions of tax dollars spent on green energy went to jobs in foreign countries. It claims that stimulus bill tax credits went overseas, such as "$1.2 billion to a solar company that's building a plant in Mexico." The ad even cites sources for its claim. But those same sources, plus a few phone calls, quickly bring down the ad’s house of cards. Sure, taxpayer money was originally approved for a California solar company that also happened to open a plant in Mexico. But that loan — not tax credits, as the ad claims — will go to a New Jersey company for a solar project in California, employing construction workers in the state, using mostly California-built solar panels, to create solar power that’ll be purchased by a California utility. That’s a completely different story. The ad strings together alarming-sounding tidbits about actual stimulus projects to create the impression of something else entirely — in a way that’s ultimately ridiculous. And that earns our lowest rating, Pants on Fire.	None	Americans for Prosperity	None	None	None	2012-05-02T11:31:30	2012-04-26	['Mexico']
pomt-11691	"Julia Roberts claims ‘Michelle Obama isn’t fit to clean Melania’s toilet’ "	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/dec/28/usa-daily-portal/fake-news-julia/	A phony story on Facebook says American actress Julia Roberts insulted former first lady Michelle Obama after a visit to Roberts’ New York film production studio. "Julia Roberts claims ‘Michelle Obama isn’t fit to clean Melania’s toilet,’ " stated a Dec. 14 headline on USA Daily Portal, which linked to the full story on yet another website, brightstars.me. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The story is the same as one on yournewswire.com and was previously debunked by Snopes. These articles are fake news and appear to be a riff on a USA Today editorial that criticized Trump after his tweet Dec. 12 calling U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand "a lightweight senator ... who would come to my office ‘begging’ for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them." Some interpreted Trump’s tweet as veiled language that Gillibrand would trade sexual favors for campaign cash, although White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders dismissed that characterization because she said he used similar language about men. USA Today’s editorial board reacted to Trump’s tweet: "A president who’d all but call a senator a whore is unfit to clean toilets in Obama’s presidential library or to shine George W. Bush’s shoes." The fake news story about Roberts and Michelle Obama mimicked the toilet cleaning theme. USA Daily Portal stated that after Obama left the set of Roberts’ film, Roberts commented about the differences between America’s most recent first ladies. The post accuses Roberts of saying Melania Trump has been "looked down upon and disrespected by sneering liberals across the country" while "doing a brilliant job," and Michelle Obama "isn’t fit to clean to clean her toilet." The statements followed a fictitious pattern, with more made-up quotes from Roberts attacking singer Celine Dion for criticizing Trump. We found no evidence Roberts made any of those statements about the Obamas, Melania Trump or Celine Dion. In fact, Roberts has supported national Democrats in recent years including Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. In October 2016, Roberts was one of several Hollywood and Broadway stars to team up to hold a fundraiser for Clinton at the St. James Theatre in New York. Wearing a "Hill Yeah" t-shirt, Roberts read from the play Red Hot Patriot: The Kick-Ass Wit of Molly Ivins. Roberts also appeared at Democratic fundraisers hosted by Obama, including a Santa Monica fundraiser on in April 2016 and one at Gwyneth Paltrow’s home in 2014. We were unable to find contact information for the USA Daily Portal website. We sent an email to the Your News Wire website that previously posted the article and did not get a reply. A fake news story stated that Roberts claimed "‘Michelle Obama isn’t fit to clean Melania’s toilet." We rate this headline Pants on Fire. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Correction: An earlier version of this fact-check stated that Roberts read one of Molly Ivins’ columns. Allison Engel, co-author of the play Red Hot Patriot: The Kick-Ass Wit of Molly Ivins, contacted PolitiFact after our fact-check published to tell us that the excerpt that Roberts read was from the play. Engel said she supplied the text to the producer of the fundraiser.	None	USA Daily Portal	None	None	None	2017-12-28T09:40:09	2017-12-14	['Julia_Roberts', 'Michelle_Obama']
pomt-14832	The federal government is "making the decision, whether we like it or not, to send 425 refugees to our state" from Syria.	half-true	/florida/statements/2015/nov/20/rick-scott/do-federal-officials-plan-send-425-syrian-refugees/	Florida Gov. Rick Scott has joined dozens of governors who say they don’t want to take Syrian refugees following the terrorist attacks in Paris. He criticized the federal government’s plans to take 10,000 Syrian refugees during an interview with Fox News’ Stuart Varney on Nov. 17. "This is something that they are making the decision, whether we like it or not, to send 425 refugees to our state without giving us any information." Is Scott right that the feds have decided to send 425 Syrian refugees to Florida with no input from the state? We decided to check it out. Do the feds decide on the number of refugees for Florida? Americans have zeroed in on Syrian refugees following the Nov. 13 Paris attacks, because a supposed Syrian passport was found near the body of one of the terrorists.We should note that is not confirmed; the passport may have been fake, and investigations are underway. The six Paris attackers identified so far were French and Belgian nationals. For the most recent year ending in September, Florida took in 48,816 refugees, with the largest group from Cuba. That number included 104 people from Syria, which has been in a civil war since 2011. Most of the Syrians settled in Duval, Hillsborough, Miami-Dade and Pinellas counties. (We explained the process of extensive background checks in our PolitiFact Sheet.) President Barack Obama announced in September that the federal government would accept an additional 10,000 refugees from Syria for the next year, for a total of 85,000 refugees from all countries. So who decides how many come to Florida? Scott said that the federal government made the decision to send 425. While the federal government is in charge of resettlement, the actual number comes from agencies within local communities in Florida. (Politico also noted this in a report on Scott's comments.) At the beginning of each federal fiscal year, the State Department works with nine national volunteer agencies to allocate the number of refugees per agency. They take into account factors such as whether the refugees have family members in certain states, their employment and educational backgrounds, and if they have any health concerns, according to Mark Hetfield, the president and CEO of HIAS, formerly known as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. In Florida, there are 25 local affiliates that are a part of those national groups. The local affiliates in Miami, Tampa, Clearwater and other cities inform the Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) and the U.S. State Department how many refugees from across the globe the affiliates can handle for the fiscal year. For the current year, the total added up to 3,942, according to DCF. And that’s the number that the federal government signed off on for Florida. Recently, the government asked states if they could accept more refugees. On Nov. 9, Lawrence Bartlett, a State Department official, wrote a letter to DCF noting that Obama increased the maximum number of Syrian refugees and would ask the nonprofit groups how many additional refugees they could take. Local affiliates told state and federal officials they could take an additional 425 refugees. Technically, those 425 aren’t all guaranteed to be Syrians, according to DCF, but the Syrian crisis is what prompted the request. So far, federal officials haven’t approved any particular number for Florida. "We don’t know how many Syrians will be resettled into any one state or city at this point," Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman, told PolitiFact Florida. "Regarding the local agencies' letter saying they can take an additional 425 refugees, it is likely that we can expect there will be a similar letter approving that number as well. Those 425 refugees will come from all over the world." That means that officially, the federal government hasn’t decided yet to send 425 refugees to Florida, but it appears possible that that will end up being the number -- although they may not all be Syrians. When we asked Scott’s office about his media appearances quoting the 425 figures, it pointed us to more cautious wording that Scott used in a Nov. 16 letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell asking them to cut off funding for the resettlement: "Please be aware that several organizations have requested that our state Department of Children and Families support the relocation of possible 425 Syrian refugees to Florida, as they receive federal funding to house those refugees in our state." Scott spokeswoman Jackie Schutz told PolitiFact Florida that "in his letter he was very clear to say ‘possible 425.’ ... The governor is very concerned -- it could be 425. All we know is it is possibly 425." Scott has a point when he says the refugees get sent to the states "whether we like it or not." The Refugee Act of 1980 says the federal government is expected "to the maximum extent possible" to take states’ concerns into account, but there are no legal consequences if federal officials ignore governors such as Scott. State officials don’t have veto power, because the federal government has the sole authority over immigration decisions, including refugees. Our ruling Rick Scott says the federal government is "making the decision, whether we like it or not, to send 425 refugees to our state" from Syria. Scott’s statement makes it sound like federal officials came up with a number of refugees and dictated that Florida must take them in. That’s misleading, because the number came from local resettlement agencies, which reported to the federal government how many additional refugees they could handle within the next year. Those refugees might or might not all be Syrians, though it seems likely they would be. Scott has a point that the power to resettle refugees lies with the federal government, and he can’t halt the refugees from coming to Florida. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-04759	Says Paul Ryan "tried to change the whole game" for Social Security	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/aug/28/barack-obama/radio-ad-barack-obama-says-paul-ryan-tried-change-/	A radio ad from the Barack Obama campaign attacks vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan by bringing up Ryan’s record of attempting to reform entitlement programs. In the ad, a man and a woman are heard talking about how the GOP candidates would replace Medicare with a voucher program and increase healthcare costs. But it also implicates past ideas Ryan has proposed to reform Social Security. "Now Mitt Romney picks a vice presidential candidate like Paul Ryan, who tried to change the whole game when it comes to Medicare and Social Security," the woman in the ad says. We’ve checked many claims on Republican plans for Medicare, but what’s Ryan’s record on Social Security reform? Did he really try to change the whole game? Ryan’s first attempts at Social Security legislation Five years after being elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, Ryan proposed the Social Security Personal Savings Guarantee and Prosperity Act of 2004. It was the first of essentially three different plans Ryan has advanced in the last eight years. Ryan’s plan was a response to projected shortfalls in the Social Security program. In 2033 or so, payouts would drop to about 75 percent of current benefits if nothing if changed. (Interestingly, Ryan is himself has received Social Security: He received two years of survivor’s benefits after his father’s death when Ryan was 16.) His plan suggested revamping the Social Security Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance program by allowing workers younger than 55 to divert some of their contributions from Social Security to voluntary personal savings accounts. The money in the accounts would be invested, overseen by the government, instead of paying for current retiree benefits. The plan allowed workers to invest about half of their payroll taxes in their personal accounts, based on a progressive formula. At retirement, the account would convert into an annuity that paid benefits at least equal to Social Security, and potentially more, depending on how the investments performed. Workers who never invested in a personal savings account would be provided current-level benefits, but the proposal assumed everyone would switch, since the personal accounts would give the same benefits with no risk of a reduction in payouts. The selling point of this plan was that current benefits could be maintained through 2077 without raising taxes. But the plan required more than $2 trillion for the first 10 years of transitional funding. With people moving contributions out of the traditional Social Security program, shortfalls in traditional Social Security payouts would have to be made up by borrowing from general revenue, which is collected through income taxes. The government would also have to make up for ups and downs in the stock market, which could affect how much the investment accounts were able to pay. This plan died in committee in 2004. Ryan reintroduced it in 2005, but it failed to move forward again. That same year, President George W. Bush introduced a similar plan that used personal savings accounts, but the Bush proposal also proved largely unpopular both with the public and on Capitol Hill. Ryan became ranking member of the House Budget Committee in 2007, and tried again the next year. The new plan made a number of changes to lower the costs to the government, raising retirement ages and cutting benefits for middle- and high-income workers, but protecting payments to low-wage workers. It also made employer contributions to health insurance policies taxable as a source of revenue for the program. The 2008 plan, known as the Roadmap to America’s Future, also recommended switching Medicare to a premium support plan, giving states control of Medicaid and scaling back the amount of payroll taxes that could be invested in the accounts from one-half to one-third. It met the same fate as its predecessors, and died in committee, as it did after being reintroduced in 2010. Ryan’s plans with a Republican majority Ryan became chairman of the House Budget Committee in 2011. His current Path to Prosperity budget resolution, which was introduced in 2011 and again in 2012, jettisons all mention of potential privatization, choosing instead to focus on overhauling Medicare and cutting taxes and expenditures. He has said subsequently this was to minimize political grandstanding on the part of Democrats. "If we put a Social Security plan out there it’d be too tempting for Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi to demagogue it just like they’re doing on Medicare, running all these ‘Mediscare’ campaigns," Ryan said at a discussion during the Peter G. Peterson Foundation 2011 fiscal summit. "We figured they would do that on Social Security and make it harder to get a Social Security agreement." The resolution suggests only that "in the event that the Social Security program is not sustainable, the President, in conjunction with the Board of Trustees, must submit a plan for restoring balance to the fund." This would also require the U.S. House and Senate to provide ideas for potential solutions, as well. The House passed the non-binding budget resolution for fiscal year 2012, but it was voted down in the Democrat-controlled Senate. The current fiscal year 2013 plan, which aims to further reduce the deficit and take down Obamacare, also passed the House but not the Senate, and now serves as one of the flashpoints of the presidential campaign. The Romney-Ryan plan for Social Security So now that he’s a vice presidential candidate, what would a potential Romney-Ryan administration do about Social Security? Romney has previously endorsed the Path to Prosperity, but when PolitiFact asked Romney spokesman Ryan Williams about the candidate’s plan for Social Security, he directed us to Romney’s website, which contained two points: "First, for future generations of seniors, Mitt believes that the retirement age should be slowly increased to account for increases in longevity. "Second, for future generations of seniors, Mitt believes that benefits should continue to grow but that the growth rate should be lower for those with higher incomes." The site also noted it plans "no change in benefits for those at or near retirement." Romney mentions private savings accounts in his 2010 book, No Apology: The Case For American Greatness, but notes the Great Recession likely has shelved that idea for now. "Given the volatility of investment values that we have just experienced, I would prefer that individual accounts were added to Social Security, not diverted from it, and that they were voluntary," he wrote. The add-on accounts Romney mentions are a key difference from Ryan’s plan. Romney wrote he wanted the accounts to be in addition to current benefits, while Ryan has stated he wanted the accounts, which were always slated to be voluntary, to replace drawing benefits from the current Social Security Trust Fund. Now, neither Republican candidate seems to be addressing them in the campaign at all. The ruling So are the Democrats correct that Paul Ryan tried to "change the whole game" of Social Security? It depends on how you’re scoring. He did indeed propose a sweeping change to Social Security in 2004 and several times since. But we find it’s not quite true that he "changed the whole game." Even at its most ambitious, his plan did not affect people who were older than 55 and, for younger workers, the plans were voluntary and allowed workers to stay within the traditional Social Security system. At no time has he proposed ending Social Security altogether, but that’s not exactly what the radio ad is alleging. His most recent plan is limited to a demand that the White House and Congress fix it at some unspecified point in the future. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-06797	"The weight of the evidence (on global warming) is that most of it, maybe all of it, is because of natural causes ... it’s fair to say the science is in dispute."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/14/tim-pawlenty/do-scientists-disagree-about-global-warming/	Climate change has become a touchy subject in the Republican primary. Though some candidates once supported plans to reduce carbon emissions, such strategies have fallen out of favor with Republicans in recent years. Even acknowledging that human beings are causing climate change can be politically problematic for some Republicans. Our colleagues at the Miami Herald asked Republican presidential candidate and former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty about his views on climate change in an interview on Aug. 3, 2011. His response piqued our interest: "Well, there’s definitely climate change. The more interesting question is how much is a result of natural causes and how much, if any, is attributable to human behavior. And that’s what the scientific dispute is about," said Pawlenty. "It’s something we have to look to the science on. The weight of the evidence is that most of it, maybe all of it, is because of natural causes... There’s lots of layers to it. But at least as to any potential man-made contribution to it, it’s fair to say the science is in dispute." We divided Pawlenty’s answer into his two essential claims: • Evidence points toward climate change being primarily a natural, rather than man-made, phenomenon. • The science about the causes of global climate change is in dispute. To check the first claim, we turned to the most recent report by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a scientific body considered the leading international organization on climate science. "Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations," the 2007 report states. "The observed widespread warming of the atmosphere and ocean, together with ice mass loss, support the conclusion that it is extremely unlikely that global climate change of the past 50 years can be explained without external forcing, and very likely that it is not due to known natural causes alone." (External forcing refers to anything that changes the climate that is outside of the normal climate system.) In the United States, the U.S. Global Change Research Program coordinates and integrates federal research on climate. Its 2009 report mirrored the IPCC’s conclusions: "Observations show that warming of the climate is unequivocal. The global warming observed over the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases. These emissions come mainly from the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas), with important contributions from the clearing of forests, agricultural practices, and other activities." The IPCC report states that the period from 1995 to 2006 contains 11 of the 12 warmest years on record since instrumental measurement began in 1850. It concluded that global surface temperature rose 0.76 degrees Celsius from the end of the 19th century (1850-1899) to the beginning of the 21st (2001-2005). The U.S. Global Change Research Program’s report similarly found that the average global temperature increase by 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since 1900. While these temperature changes may sound small, keep in mind that these are averages. The rise in temperature, and its visible effects, are more pronounced in certain parts of the world than in others. The polar ice sheets are particularly vulnerable to temperature increases. Greenland lost 36 to 60 cubic miles of ice from 2002 to 2006 while Antarctica lost 36 cubic miles of ice during roughly the same time period. Brian Soden, a professor of meteorology and physical oceanography at the University of Miami, was one of the many scientific contributors to the 2007 IPCC report. "The rise in global mean temperature since the 19th century may seem small, and projections of global mean warming over the next century range from 2 to 5 degrees Celsius," Soden said. "One way to put these numbers into perspective is to realize that the current climate is now only about 5 degrees Celsius warmer than it was during the last ‘glacial maximum’ (approximately 20,000 years ago) when ice covered much of North America extending all the way down to St Louis." If you’ve been following the debate recently, you may remember that climate research on temperature was called into question in 2009 when stolen e-mails from the Climatic Research United at the University of East Anglia were released on the Internet. Global warming skeptics said the e-mails showed climate researchers were manipulating data. But several inquiries debunked those allegations, including those conducted by the British Parliament, the U.S. Department of Commerce, Pennsylvania State University, and the InterAcademy Council. The inquiries found that while the scientists had made rude remarks about people who questioned climate change, they were not falsifying data. A few reports recommended greater transparency and sharing of climatic data, but the independent investigations exonerated the researchers of falsifying data. We looked into the work of the most prominent and best credentialed people who have questioned the IPCC’s conclusions on global warming. Generally speaking, even these scientists do not claim that humans are making no contribution at all to rising temperatures. Rather, they tend to make more nuanced points. They question whether carbon emissions alone are driving up temperatures, or whether other human activities contribute as well. They question whether extreme weather events such as storms or floods can be conclusively linked to rising temperatures. And, they question whether significant changes to public policy are necessary as a means of coping with rising temperatures. For Pawlenty’s second claim -- that there is dispute about the causes of climate change -- we decided to look at the opinions of world scientists about the issue. Several studies have attempted to quantify how much agreement there is among scientists when it comes to climate change. A 2010 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences - the official publication of the United States National Academy of Sciences - found that out of 1,372 climate researchers surveyed, approximately 97 to 98 percent of those actively publishing in the field said they believe human beings are causing the climate change, which they term anthropogenic (i.e., man-made) climate change. It also concluded that "the relative climate expertise and scientiﬁc prominence" of the researchers unconvinced of man-made climate change are "substantially below that of the convinced researchers." An earlier survey published in the 2009 issue of Eos -- a publication of the American Geophysical Union -- surveyed scientists from a wide range of disciplines (approximately 3,146) and asked: "Do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures?" Approximately 82 percent of the surveyed scientists answered yes to this question. Of those climate change specialists surveyed, 97.4 percent answered yes to this question. Climate change skeptics have their own petition, commonly called the Oregon petition, that has been endorsed by 31,000 signers opposing restrictions on carbon emissions. But that petition has been criticized for not checking the credentials of its signatories or proving that the signatories exist. To be clear, we’re not saying that no scientists dispute man-made climate change. When we contacted the Pawlenty campaign, they pointed us to several published pieces, such as writings by John R. Christy, who was counted as a dissenting researcher as part of the 2010 study from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. But these skeptics seem to be a small -- even tiny -- minority, in contrast to Pawlenty’s comments suggesting significant disagreement. Many of the skeptics agree that climate change is occurring and that human activities play a part. But they disagree with some of the conclusions formulated in mainstream climate science. To summarize: Based on our research, there is very little dispute in the scientific community, especially among climate specialists, on whether climate change is primarily caused by natural or man-made forces. The overwhelming majority of scientists polled feel that human activity is the primary driver of climate change. Also, based on scientific studies by the IPCC and others, global warming over the past 50 years has been primarily driven by human activity. Based upon the preponderance of evidence we conclude that Tim Pawlenty’s claims are both incorrect and misleading to the public, who may not be familiar with the science behind climate change. It is not "fair to say the science is in dispute," as if there are good arguments on both sides. Rather, there is significant scientific consensus that human beings are contributing to global warming. We rate his statement False. Editor's Note: Pawlenty announced he was dropping out of the presidential race on Aug. 14. Also, this report was changed to reflect a more expansive definition of external forcing.

Buono’s claim is largely correct. Let’s look at what’s going on here before addressing where any jobs have gone. Buono spokesman David Turner said Buono’s statement refers to New Jersey’s percentage of pharma jobs nationwide lost since 1990. Accordingly, we reviewed U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data to compare state and national numbers from December 1990 to December 2012. New Jersey had 42,300 pharma jobs in December 1990. The nation had 210,400. So New Jersey’s share was 20.1 percent. In December 2012 New Jersey had 28,100 pharma jobs, compared with 275,100 nationally. That means the state’s share was 10.2 percent. So Buono is close to her claim that New Jersey lost "more than half" its pharma jobs. Next, let’s review where the lost New Jersey pharma jobs are going. James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, said New Jersey has lost life sceinces jobs largely because the industry has a new business model for a new type of research and drug development. "Pharma is putting its cutting edge facilities near university centers of excellence in the life sciences, such as Cambridge, Bay Area, San Diego, etc.," Hughes said in an e-mail. "They want to be in interactive environments, not in insulated suburban facilities. This is the new business model for bio-based drug development. NJ specialized in chemical based drug development. The environments that pharma now wants are all high tax and high cost environments. They are willing to pay any price to be near centers of research excellence, leading scientists, and the leading hospitals for clinical trials." Dean J. Paranicas, president and CEO of the HealthCare Institute of New Jersey, a trade association that represents the life sciences industry, said infrastructure, government support and high-tech capabilities at higher education institutions also are factors. "New Jersey is in competition with every state regardless of its tax structure because the life sciences industry is a highly coveted one," Paranicas said. Mergers among major pharma companies are another reason for the smaller workforce in life sciences. Within the past few years, Manhattan-based Pfizer bought Madison-based Wyeth; Merck merged with Schering-Plough and cut 15 percent of its workforce; and Roche has moved some jobs to both California and New York City. A 2011 report from the state Labor Department points out that the recession, cost-cutting measures and expiration of patents also factored into industry job losses. "Senator Buono attributes this trend to many factors including the Governor’s unwillingness to fully fund our education system and lack of leadership in creating research partnerships similar to other states," Turner said in an e-mail. "Pharmaceutical companies are moving to states with equally high taxes but provide more funding for research and development. In places such as California, Massachusetts, and New York, companies are clearly attracted to the concentration of well-regarded universities that have forged partnerships with private industry." Hughes and Paranicas said the merger of Rutgers, Rowan and the University of Medicine and Dentistry New Jersey is important for the industry’s needs in high-tech research. Our ruling Buono said during a recent appearance on NJToday that "New Jersey has lost over half of our pharmaceutical jobs to states you know, not low-tax states like in the South, but high-tax states like New York." She’s correct that New Jersey has lost pharma jobs, but it’s not the "more than half" that she claimed. Jobs have been lost for a variety of reasons, from the industry’s new business model to wanting to be near universities and hospitals of excellence, and more. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-05224	Says PolitiFact "listed Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin as the Governor who told the most lies" and "our own ‘untruthful’ Governor Chris Christie made it into Politifact's top five of ‘Lie - en Governors’."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jun/07/loretta-weinberg/loretta-weinberg-claims-politifact-listed-chris-ch/	Politicians take heed: when attacking your rivals for not telling the truth, make certain you have your facts straight. Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg (D-Bergen) wrote a post on the liberal blog Blue Jersey on Monday criticizing Christie and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, both Republicans, for their lack of truthfulness. But in the process, she distorted some facts of her own. "Politifact listed Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin as the Governor who told the most lies," Weinberg wrote. "Well not to be [outdone], our own ‘untruthful’ Governor Chris Christie made it into Politifact's top five of ‘Lie - en Governors.’ We’re so proud Mr. Christie. You should really put that accolade right under your ‘Jersey Comeback’ banner." This claim surprised us: PolitiFact New Jersey never compiled such a list -- and neither did any of our fact-checking colleagues. So what is Weinberg talking about? The state senator’s statement was based on a list posted on the liberal blog Uppity Wisconsin. The list ranked governors fact-checked at least five times by PolitiFact by the percentage of True and Mostly True ratings they received. Walker had the lowest combined percentage of those two rulings, according to the June 1 blog post. The post concluded that "Walker is the #1 most dishonest governor in America." Christie took fourth place among the "top five most dishonest governors in America" with 38 percent of his PolitiFact rulings earning True or Mostly True. The blog’s tally of percentages of True and Mostly True rulings for governors in its top five list was mostly accurate at the time, but there’s several problems with the conclusions made from that data. PolitiFact Editor Bill Adair called suggestions that a governor is "in the top five" for falsehoods "inaccurate -- and meaningless." Overall, PolitiFact has checked 22 sitting governors. Only 10 of those governors have faced the Truth-O-Meter at least five times. In a pool of 10, it’s not difficult to land a spot in the top five. "It's fine if people want to use our report cards to compare the records of people we fact-check. But it's important to be accurate about what those report cards say and what they don't," Adair said. "The report cards provide a tally of the claims we chose to check. But it's not accurate to say the report cards indicate who ‘told the most lies.’ We are journalists who choose our fact-checks based on what is newsworthy. We are not social scientists and are not using any kind of random sample to select statements to check." Jason Butkowski, a spokesman for the New Jersey Senate Democrats, acknowledged Weinberg erred in citing PolitiFact as the source of the ranking, but, he said in an e-mail, "that does not take away from the larger issue – that Governor Christie, who prides himself on his straight-talking Jersey guy demeanor, only scored truthful or mostly truthful an abysmal 38% of the time in the 37 statements analyzed by PolitiFact." Obviously, PolitiFact doesn’t track every statement, nor do they track every Governor on an even playing field, so issuing any kind of quantitative ranking of public officials based on PolitiFact’s information doesn’t work. However, the people of New Jersey can, and should, expect more from Governor Christie when it comes to leveling with them on the big issues that matter most to our State." Our ruling Weinberg claimed PolitiFact listed Walker as the governor "who told the most lies" and Christie made it into PolitiFact’s "top five of ‘Lie - en Governors’." Weinberg is wrong on both counts. PolitiFact never ranked governors by their falsehoods. Though PolitiFact breaks down ratings by percentages, those figures represent how an individual’s statements have fared on the Truth-O-Meter. They do not show who "told the most lies." We rate Weinberg’s claim False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Loretta Weinberg	None	None	None	2012-06-07T07:30:00	2012-06-04	['Chris_Christie', 'Wisconsin']
pomt-08537	The federal government can tell General Motors what to charge for its automobiles.	false	/georgia/statements/2010/oct/04/phil-gingrey/gingrey-says-gm-deal-sign-federal-overreach/	Congressman Phil Gingrey was recently on CNN arguing in favor of repealing the federal health care legislation passed earlier this year when he steered the conversation to another area of what he considered government overreach. The Marietta Republican used the federal government's bailout of General Motors as an example of Uncle Sam being too involved in the private sector. "We're concerned with a powerful government who is telling General Motors now, maybe, what they can charge for their automobiles," said Gingrey, a physician. "Indeed, if the government owns 61 percent, they can do that." Does the federal government have that type of influence? "It's false," GM spokesman Greg Martin said. So who's right here? Let's begin with some background about the federal government's role in the automaker's management. In December 2008, during the final days of the presidency of George W. Bush, the government approved a $17.4 billion loan to GM and Chrysler to keep the companies running. GM received $13.4 billion, but a few months later, the company said it needed more money. GM produced a survival plan that included cutting 47,000 jobs worldwide and closing five U.S. factories. In June 2009, President Barack Obama approved a bankruptcy deal that gave GM $30 billion. In exchange, the government took a 60 percent controlling stake in the company. As of late September, GM had repaid $6.7 billion. The remaining money was converted to a 61 percent ownership stake in GM plus $2.1 billion worth of preferred stock, The Associated Press reported. AJC PolitiFact Georgia looked at several contracts between the federal government and GM, and we didn't see any specific language that suggested Uncle Sam would have any influence over pricing. We spoke with Gingrey's office and discussed our review of the contracts. The congressman's spokeswoman, Meredith Griffanti, said the federal government's stake in GM gives it the power to have some say on pricing. "GM repaid the government $6.7 billion," Griffanti said in a statement. "The remaining money was converted to a 61 percent ownership stake in GM plus $2.1 billion worth of preferred stock. Based on that, the government does in fact have a 61 percent stake in GM. Clearly that number makes the federal government the majority stakeholder, which undoubtedly allows 'big government' enormous influence over the direction of the company." A Treasury Department spokesman forwarded us testimony in December from Assistant Secretary Herbert Allison, who said government involvement in the day-to-day management of GM is not its goal. "Government involvement in the day-to-day management of a company might actually reduce the value of these investments, impede the ability of the companies to return fully to being privately owned," Allison said. Obama has said "the United States government has no interest in running GM." Most members of the 12-member GM board of directors have been appointed since the bankruptcy agreement. The board includes former Coca-Cola Chairman E. Neville Isdell and University System of Georgia Chancellor Errol Davis Jr. Records show the board has control over executive compensation and has a public policy committee. Martin, the GM spokesman, said that committee looks at regulatory issues concerning energy, the environment, trade and taxes. It also reviews GM's philanthropic activities. The board, Martin said, does not deal with day-to-day activities and pricing. David Zaring, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, said "it's possible" for the federal government to have some influence over policy matters such as automobile pricing through its board appointments. However, Zaring said he has watched closely to see whether that has happened and, so far, it hasn't. "It's easy to overstate how overinterventionist the government is being," Zaring said. There's no written language in the GM contract with the federal government that states Uncle Sam has any control over vehicle pricing. The board has not gotten involved in such matters, according to GM and others who have paid attention. We found no evidence that the federal government could influence pricing, aside from Zaring's suggestion that "it's possible" that board members could involve themselves in such matters. Therefore, we rate Gingrey's statement that the federal government could tell GM what to charge for its automobiles as False.	None	Phil Gingrey	None	None	None	2010-10-04T06:00:00	2010-09-25	['None']
pomt-15166	Planned Parenthood is "not actually doing women’s health issues."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/26/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-planned-parenthood-isnt-involved-womens-h/	Planned Parenthood is not involved in women’s health issues, said Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush. At a town hall in Englewood, Colo., Aug. 25, an audience member asked Bush about his record on women’s health, as well as what he would do for women’s health, particularly for veterans, as president. "When I was governor, we expanded those programs through community-based organizations, and that’s something I think the federal government needs to continue to do," Bush said. "I, for one, don’t think Planned Parenthood ought to get a penny, though. And that’s the difference because they’re not actually doing women’s health issues. They're involved in something way different than that." Bush, who cut off state funding for Planned Parenthood as governor, then pivoted to talk about veterans affairs. Bush’s claim that the organization is not involved in women’s health caught our attention. Setting aside the issue of abortion, Planned Parenthood offers many other medical services -- most of which seem obviously related to women’s health. We reached out to Bush’s campaign, and it directed us to a tweet that Bush posted, after Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton criticized his Aug. 25 remarks. Bush’s tweet said, "PP (Planned Parenthood) treatment of unborn has been horrifying. Let's support quality women's health programs instead." The National Library of Medicine defines "women’s health" as "the branch of medicine that focuses on the treatment and diagnosis of diseases and conditions that affect a woman's physical and emotional well-being." While "women’s health" encompasses all health issues as they pertain to women, reproductive health in particular is Planned Parenthood’s primary focus. The organization offers contraception, sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, pregnancy testing, prenatal services and cancer screenings, including breast exams. (No, Planned Parenthood does not provide mammograms, but it conducts breast exams and refers women to other clinics for mammograms.) In total, Planned Parenthood saw 2.7 million individual patients in 2013, and it provided nearly 11 million services, according to its most recent annual report. About 12 percent of patients received an abortion, (assuming one procedure per abortion patient), so the remaining 88 percent of patients received other health services. Here’s the section of the report breaking down services provided in 2013: Our friends at the Washington Post's Fact Checker also looked at Bush's claim and gave it four pinocchios, their lowest rating. Our ruling Bush said, Planned Parenthood is "not actually doing women’s health issues." It’s hard to reconcile Bush’s statement with the fact that -- setting abortion procedures aside -- Planned Parenthood offered more than 10 million services in 2013. Those services included contraception, breast exams, pregnancy tests, pap tests and STI testing and treatment. Bush is opposed to abortion, but it doesn’t make sense to say that Planned Parenthood isn’t addressing women’s health issues. We rate Bush’s claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-09972	Pay-as-you-go "is the principle that helped transform large deficits into surpluses in the 1990s."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/07/barack-obama/obama-exaggerates-role-pay-you-go-balancing-federa/	President Barack Obama has been singing the praises of "pay as you go," a budget approach that is supposed to force lawmakers to offset new spending with an equal amount of revenue or budget cuts. In his April 25, 2009, radio and video address, Obama said, "We need to adhere to the basic principle that new tax or entitlement policies should be paid for. This principle— known as PAYGO — helped transform large deficits into surpluses in the 1990s. Now, we must restore that sense of fiscal discipline." He repeated the claim on May 7, 2009, in a speech at the White House when he unveiled the details of 2010 budget. "One important step is restoring the "pay as you go" rule — and I've called on Congress to do exactly that," he said. "This rule says, very simply, that Congress can only spend a dollar if it saves a dollar elsewhere. This is the principle that guides responsible families managing a budget. This is the principle that helped transform large deficits into surpluses in the 1990s." We wondered if he was correct about PAYGO's role in balancing the federal budget in the 1990s. We found that Obama is correct that Congress operated under a PAYGO law that was in effect from 1990 until it expired in 2002. When the Democrats took control of Congress after the 2006 elections, they established a PAYGO rule, but it has been waived for some of the most expensive bills, such as the economic stimulus bill. Fiscal hawks are urging Congress to replace that rule with a new law that would have more impact and be more binding. Obama is also right, of course, that the federal budget was balanced by 1998 and ran four years of surpluses before plunging back into deficit. The question is how much to credit PAYGO for those surpluses. To find the answer, we interviewed budget analysts and examined reports on the deficit and the impact of PAYGO. We found a general consensus that PAYGO was a factor that reduced the deficit, but most said it was not as important as the two biggest forces that led to a balanced budget— the increase in tax receipts from the booming economy and defense cuts made possible by the end of the Cold War. Still, there was a range of opinion on how much the rule helped. Alice Rivlin, budget chief under President Bill Clinton, characterized PAYGO as a significant factor. She said in a recent interview on PBS's Frontline that PAYGO and other budget rules "made it easier for the Clinton administration to work on the budget deficit." She said the PAYGO rule provided discipline so policymakers could resist tempting but expensive programs. The rule "meant that the president could say no, and the Congress could say no to a lot of good-sounding ideas, including Medicare prescription drugs" that would have made it difficult to balance the budget. That's backed up by a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that said, "Between 1991 and 1997, most new revenue and mandatory spending laws that were enacted were consistent with the PAYGO requirement to be deficit neutral; end-of-session balances on the PAYGO scorecard consistently showed zero or net reductions in the deficit." Josh Gordon, policy director for the Concord Coalition, a group that advocates fiscal responsibility and was founded in the midst of the PAYGO movement in 1992, said PAYGO provided some important discipline for members of Congress even if it was not as big a factor as the booming economy and the defense cuts. "There always needs to be a check on irresponsibility in Congress and PAYGO provides that," he said. But Brian Riedl, a budget analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation, said PAYGO's importance has been exaggerated. "There is this grand myth that we passed PAYGO and then we got this balanced budget. But we got the balanced budget because the Cold War ended and a bubble temporarily pushed revenues through the roof." He said that PAYGO didn't provide as much discipline as some claim because Congress repeatedly used gimmicks or took steps to ignore it. So back to Obama's claim. He said the PAYGO "is the principle that helped transform large deficits into surpluses in the 1990s." He is correct that it is a basic principle behind the effort to balance the budget, but his statement leaves the impression that it was the biggest factor. It wasn't. Yes, PAYGO rules provided some discipline that might have restrained Congress from adding more spending or new tax cuts, but the economy and the defense cuts were the biggest factors that led to the balanced budget. So we find his statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2009-05-07T16:32:40	2009-05-07	['None']
pomt-04587	James Langevin "has received almost $20 million from taxpayers and special interests to use at his own discretion to supposedly champion Rhode Island’s needs."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/sep/23/michael-riley/michael-riley-says-us-rep-jim-langevin-has-receive/	Michael Riley, the Republican businessman who wants to end Democrat U.S. Rep. James Langevin’s six-term run as congressman from Rhode Island’s 2nd District, unleashed new television and radio commercials last week, ripping into Langevin as a ravenous devourer of taxpayer money. The radio ad opens with the menacing music from the movie "Jaws" in the background, as the narrator says Langevin has "received almost $20 million from taxpayers and special interests while in office to use at his own discretion to supposedly champion Rhode Island’s needs. " The ad recites a list of problems, from high gas prices to unemployment, and claims Langevin has few policy accomplishments to show for the money he’s received. "Beware Rhode Island!" the narrator warns. "There’s a shark in the water, circling the Ocean State and looking to feast on your hard-earned tax dollars! That shark’s name is Jim Langevin." We’ll pass on the value of Langevin’s policy achievements; one party’s success is another’s crime against the Constitution. But there is an objective element of Riley’s claim that can be examined: Has Langevin gotten nearly $20 million "from taxpayers and special interests ... to use at his own discretion" in his congressional career? We called the Riley campaign for their backup. Spokesman Nicholas Tsimortos told us the number is the sum of three elements: The almost $2 million Langevin has been paid in salary during his 12 years in Congress. The more than $6 million that’s been donated to Langevin’s campaigns since he first ran in 2000. The $11 million spent to pay the staffers who have worked for him over those 12 years. Add them up and they come to more than $18 million, hence "almost $20 million." Step one is figuring out if Riley’s numbers are right. For Langevin’s campaign contribution totals, we went to Opensecrets.org, a campaign-finance database compiled by the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics. According to its records, Langevin has raised $6,253,061 over his six previous campaigns and in his current one, through Aug. 22. So Riley’s campaign got that number right. How about the $2 million in cumulative salary? When Langevin took office in January 2001, U.S. representatives got $145,100 annually; it’s up to $174,000 now. Add up Langevin’s total salary over those years and it’s $1,965,700, close enough to call it almost "$2 million." Last, and not least, is the $11 million that Riley’s campaign says Langevin has spent on staff salaries. For that, we went to Legistorm.com, which tracks congressional office spending. According to that site, $11,021,686 was paid to the 63 people who have worked on Langevin’s federally financed staff over his congressional career. That’s in line with Tsimortos’ $11-million estimate. So the numbers add up. But accurate information can be put in a misleading context. And the context of Riley’s claim -- portraying the congressman as a shark devouring taxpayer dollars -- is highly misleading. The first course of this alleged fiscal buffet is Langevin’s nearly $2 million in congressional pay. Article I, Section 6 of the U.S. Constitution requires that representatives be paid. Langevin may have discretion on how he spends his salary, but there’s nothing sinister about his accepting the same compensation every other congressman receives -- and the same salary Riley would receive if he wins. What about the $6 million in campaign contributions? Riley’s campaign says all that money comes from "special interests." Even if we were to agree with that characterization -- and most independent analysts don’t -- federal law limits what candidates can do with contributions. They can be used for commercials, polling and campaign staff, for example, but not a candidate’s personal expenses. (According to his most recent filings, Riley has given $440,200 to his campaign and accepted $69,363 in contributions.) Finally, what about the $11 million Langevin’s office has spent in staff salaries? According to the U.S. House of Representatives’ House Administration Committee website, each congressman gets an annual allowance for office salaries and expenses. It fluctuates from year to year, but has hovered at about $1 million recently. Staffers spend much of their time helping constituents having problems with, say the Social Security Administration or the Veterans Administration. And they research issues, providing representatives with the information they need to decide how to vote. Maybe Langevin could have decided not to have a staff and saved the taxpayers $11 million, but it would have meant Rhode Island’s 2nd District constituents would be less efficiently represented. Our ruling Michael Riley’s campaign ad says Rep. James Langevin "has received almost $20 million from taxpayers and special interests to use at his own discretion to supposedly champion Rhode Island’s needs." When you add Langevin’s salary, his staff salaries and his campaign contributions, you do get nearly $20 million. But Riley’s claim -- and the ad’s portrayal of Langevin as a shark looking to "feast" on taxpayers’ dollars -- suggests he has a slush fund and has used it improperly. That’s a gross distortion of very common practices allowed by law and the U.S. Constitution. We rule his statement Mostly False.

pomt-08241	Says Fort Hood near Killeen, Texas, is "the largest military installation in the free world."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/nov/15/john-cornyn/sen-john-cornyn-says-fort-hood-largest-military-in/	Honoring those who died a year ago during a mass shooting at Fort Hood, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn expressed condolences for 13 who were killed on the military base near Killeen and their surviving families and friends. "As the largest military installation in the free world, Fort Hood has long been a source of pride for Texans and all Americans," Cornyn said in a Nov. 4 statement. Media accounts often put Fort Hood and "largest" in the same sentence. But we wondered if they — and Cornyn — have that right. Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie sent us a November 2009 Reuters news story that says as much: "Occupying 339 square miles (878 square km) in Central Texas and home to more than 65,000 soldiers, civilian personnel and family members, Fort Hood ranks as the world's largest military installation. It is the largest single employer in Texas and the only military post in the United States capable of supporting two full armored divisions — 1st Calvary Division and the 4th Infantry Division." A quick Google search for "Fort Hood" and "largest military installation" turns up varying descriptions from other news organizations. ABC News dubbed it the largest military facility in the world, the Telegraph called it the largest U.S. military base in the world, and the Austin American-Statesman has referred to it as both the nation's largest military installation and one of the world's largest military installations. The Army's Fort Hood website says that "like the state of Texas, Fort Hood is big and boasts of being the largest active-duty armored post in the United States Armed Services." According to a fact sheet issued Aug. 19, 2009 by the Fort Hood Public Affairs Office: "Fort Hood is the largest single site employer in Texas, directly inserting nearly $3 billion annually into the Texas economy." And "the largest combat aviation training area in the free world, comprised of 15,900 square miles, begins on Fort Hood and continues west from Bell and Coryell counties to Runnels and Tom Green counties." Fort Hood spokeswoman Nancy Bourget told us that Fort Hood is the world's largest military post in the world at 214,895 acres. Approximately 52,000 soldiers are at Fort Hood, she said, but she said she didn't know whether that's the most soldiers stationed at a military installation in "the free world." Also, that number fluctuates: According to the August 2009 fact sheet, Fort Hood had 45,414 enlisted personnel and 8,909 civilian employees. Next, we contacted Wendy Synder, a spokeswoman at the U.S. Department of Defense, who advised caution when talking about the largest military installation in the world. "There are different installations that support various services, based on their mission and the number of people there," she said. "Are you looking at largest in terms of acreage, people assigned?" Snyder pointed us to a 2009 department report that sizes up military installations by different criteria. The Naval Station in Pearl Harbor would cost the most to replace. The Nellis Air Force Range in Nevada has the most acreage. Hawthorne Army Depot in Nevada has the most buildings. "But if you look at the size of the buildings, Fort Bragg (in North Carolina) has the largest square footage," said Snyder. We also called John Pike, director at GlobalSecurity.org, a nonpartisan Virginia-based company that specializes in information about defense and the military. His yardstick: The number of service members assigned to each installation. Pike pointed to California's Fort Irwin as an example of why you shouldn't gauge the size of an installation by acreage: it spans 642,000 acres, but functions primarily as a training ground for soldiers from elsewhere, he said. "They've only got a few thousand people stationed there, but the facility is gigantic because the brigades have to go and play army," he said. So we wondered which installation has the largest military population. Air Force spokesman Dan Elkins told us that Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio is the largest with 8,479 enlisted personnel and officers, followed by Ramstein Air Base in Germany (7,673) and Langley Air Force Base in Virginia (7,314). Lt. Gregory Wolf told us that Camp Lejeune in North Carolina and Camp Pendleton in California have the most Marine Corps personnel, with approximately 40,000-45,000 Marines and sailors stationed at each. A Navy lieutenant didn't respond to our query of the largest Naval station in the world as we were finishing this story, but according to GlobalSecurity.org Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia is the largest military station in the world "based on supported military population." The 2009 Department of Defense report shows that as of September 2008, Norfolk had 39,636 miltary personnel, though the report cautions that its personnel data "may not reflect the actual population at a particular site." Lt. Col. Alayne Conway, a spokeswoman with the Army, told us that Fort Bragg and Fort Hood are the Army's largest installations, but that their numbers fluctuate, meaning that one day Bragg could have more personnel than Hood, and another day, Hood more than Bragg. The Defense Department report shows that as of September 2008, Fort Bragg had 50,178 military personnel versus Fort Hood's 52,301. Tom McCollum, another spokesman at Fort Bragg, told us that the current population at Fort Bragg is about 55,000 soldiers. Count in civilian employees and families and the installation's population kicks up to about 99,000, he said. So, what about Fort Hood's bragging rights? In terms of its total acreage, Fort Hood isn't the largest military installation in the world. By a more meaningful gauge — the size of the military population stationed there — Fort Hood is currently second only to Fort Bragg. However, the exact number of soldiers at both posts is always fluctuating, and at times Fort Hood is the largest. We rate Cornyn's statement as Half True.

And so have those running for office. Last week, Karen Handel, one of the major candidates seeking the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate, entered the fray. In an email and Twitter post, Handel denounced the legislation. "The Senate immigration bill is over 1,000 pages long; filled with things like: rewards for au pair agencies, Alaskan seafood processors and Vegas casinos; and does not even secure the border." Lawmakers are not known for their brevity, and we knew the final Senate bill was more than 1,000 pages. What piqued our interest was Handel’s claims about the rewards included for various industries. Those industries didn’t seem like key immigration components to us. We dug for more details. Handel further criticizes the Senate bill in a longer statement posted on her campaign website. "The bill is equivalent to the amnesty measures passed in the '80s that, in large part, got us into this mess in the first place," part of the message states. "It is heavy on rewarding illegal immigrants, light on border enforcement, and it's as loaded with pork as a rib cook off!" Handel spokesman Dan McLagan pointed us to several news reports of the provisions written into the Senate amendment. A USA Today article provided the most detail. These provisions, or "rewards" as Handel calls them, are part of a compromise amendment to the Senate bill. We’ll look at them individually: Au pair agencies This part of Handel’s claim centers on the J-1 cultural-exchange visitor visa program, which allows foreigners to enter the United States under a variety of categories ranging from camp counselors to professor and research scholars. About 350,000 people enter the U.S. under J-1 visas each year, including about 20,000 au pairs. The Senate bill initially included language eliminating fees that recruiters charge foreign students to work in the U.S. But au pair agencies -- and other employee recruiting and placement agencies -- say the fees were necessary to cover administrative and travel costs for the au pairs. A compromise included in the Senate amendment still allows the fees but requires them to be set and regulated by the State Department. (Sec. 3911 of the bill) Alaskan seafood processors The final bill also includes a provision that would help the seafood industry in Alaska by allowing processors to bring in seasonal seafood workers under the summer work travel visa program. The Obama administration banned this practice last year to protect foreign exchange students from jobs the government considered dangerous. The Senate bill also includes a provision designating seafood processing as a shortage occupation, thus making it eligible for longer-term guest workers under a new visa program. (Sec. 4408) Vegas casinos This item is included in a provision of the bill that effectively extends the Corporation for Travel Promotion forever. The CTP, which has been renamed Brand USA, is a federal program designed to promote U.S. tourism abroad. It is funded by a tax on international visitors and receives up to $100 million in federal funds to match funds raised from the private sector. That federal funding would have expired in 2015, but it was extended with no end date. (Sec. 1102) When the Travel Promotion Act was passed in 2009 establishing the tourism promotion program, the hotels along the Las Vegas strip, which would benefit from the extra visitors, thanked Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., for his help in getting the bill passed. We checked with immigration experts about the Senate bill and Handel’s statement. The general thrust of the statement is accurate, the experts said, but they noted that "rewards" is a subjective word choice. To sum up, Handel said that the Senate immigration bill contains "rewards" for au pair agencies, Alaskan seafood processors and Vegas casinos.The provisions cited for the three industries are included in the legislation, along with several others. The items were part of deals fought for by industry lobbyists and included to garner support for the bill. Whether that classifies them as "rewards" is a matter of opinion -- in this case, Handel’s opinion. Handel spokesman McLagan argued for a "super true," but we’re content with a True rating.

pomt-00189	"Washington Heidi supports sanctuary cities, where illegal immigrants can be released on our streets, like this criminal, who was let go and then sexually assaulted a child."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/19/senate-leadership-fund/heidi-heitkamps-record-immigration-sanctuary-citie/	An ad released by the Senate Leadership Fund in the North Dakota Senate race paints incumbent Heidi Heitkamp as two-faced when it comes to immigration. "There are two Heidi Heitkamps. One in North Dakota, the other siding with liberals in Washington. Washington Heidi supports sanctuary cities, where illegal immigrants can be released on our streets, like this criminal, who was let go and then sexually assaulted a child. The same Heidi who is funded by Washington liberals who want to abolish ICE," the voiceover says. Heitkamp has voted against bills that would defund sanctuary cities, but that’s not the same as voting to protect criminals, as the ad suggests. The Senate Leadership Fund declined to provide evidence for its ad. Heitkamp’s campaign said she opposed bills to punish sanctuary cities because they end up punishing law enforcement for a political decision made by a municipality. Her campaign highlighted her vote in favor of Kate’s Law, a bill that would have increased penalties for unauthorized immigrants, and her support of Trump’s 2018 immigration proposal, which included $25 billion for border security, tougher enforcement and new limits on legal immigration. Heitkamp has called the movement to abolish ICE, "crazy town," and said that criticizing law enforcement for doing their job does not "sit well" with her as a former attorney general. ‘Sanctuary cities’ A sanctuary city can be a town, county or other jurisdiction. There isn’t a federal law defining sanctuary locations, but the term is generally applied to places that have policies or ordinances limiting the assistance that local police provide to federal immigration authorities. "The one common theme to sanctuary areas is not that they release criminals onto the streets, but that they will not do the work that is the responsibility of the federal enforcement agencies," said Elizabeth Cohen, a political science professor at Syracuse University. There are no sanctuary cities in North Dakota, according to research by the Federation of American Immigration Reform, which favors reduced immigration. The Senate Leadership Fund cited four Heitkamp "nay" votes in the text of their ad. The bills sought to compel cities to honor ICE detainer requests on local law enforcement agencies by withholding federal grants. They gave local authorities legal immunity to do so. The idea behind limiting cooperation between local and federal authorities is to encourage crime reporting and witnesses from the immigrant community to come forward, according to Hiroshi Motomura, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. But sanctuary policies are not absolute, allowing cooperation when immigrants meet a certain threshold for criminal convictions. "Even San Francisco policies, which are probably the most liberal in the country, require the police to cooperate when the person has a serious criminal history," said Huyen Pham, a law professor at Texas A&M University. Sexual assault case So what happened in the sexual assault case the ad mentions? We tracked down the man in the mugshot through a reverse image search. He is Juan Ramon Vasquez, an undocumented immigrant who was charged with raping a 5-year-old family member following his 2014 release from a Philadelphia jail. (He previously used the name Ramon Aguirre-Ochoa.) He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to eight to 20 years in prison for the rape. President Donald Trump and other opponents of sanctuary cities have used his case as a rallying point. Vasquez was originally arrested for an unrelated aggravated assault, but was released when the prosecutors declined to pursue the charges. ICE requested that he be held for possible deportation proceedings. The city did not honor the detainer request. Philadelphia’s sanctuary city policy states that a person cannot be detained after their release unless they are convicted of a first- or second-degree felony involving violence, and that detainer is supported by a judicial warrant. There was no conviction or warrant in Vasquez’s case. The sanctuary city bills would have forced locales to honor detainers or lose federal funding for law enforcement and other programs. However, even that may not have ensured Vasquez stayed off the streets, as he would have had the chance to ask for bond in front of an immigration judge, according to Linus Chan, a law professor at the University of Minnesota. In other words, the bills Heitkamp voted against would not necessarily have prevented the case the ad calls attention to. Our ruling The Senate Leadership Fund said, "Washington Heidi supports sanctuary cities, where illegal immigrants can be released on our streets, like this criminal, who was let go and then sexually assaulted a child." Heitkamp voted against bills that blocked law enforcement grants for sanctuary cities, because she said she didn't want to punish law enforcement agencies. She also voted in favor of other bills that ramped up immigration law enforcement. The ad suggests that Heitkamp sympathizes with abolishing ICE, when she called the idea "crazy town." The ad also suggests sanctuary cities allow violent criminals to roam the streets, but that's a skewed interpretation. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-06149	Says President Obama "helped more than half a million veterans and military family members go to college through the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/19/michelle-obama/michelle-obama-credits-president-new-gi-bill/	To mark the end of combat in Iraq and the return of U.S. troops in time for the holidays, President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama spoke at Fort Bragg, N.C., on Dec. 14, 2011. Michelle Obama thanked service members and their families for their sacrifices and touted her husband’s work in supporting returning veterans. She mentioned improved mental health care for veterans and tax cuts for businesses that hire veterans. She also said this of her husband: "He's helped more than half a million veterans and military family members go to college through the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill." That makes it sound like the G.I. Bill was a major initiative of President Obama. But it was actually signed into law by his predecessor. The new GI Bill The bill, officially called the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008, was introduced by Sen. Jim Webb, a Democrat from Virginia and Vietnam War veteran. It paid for veterans who served at least three years after Sept. 11, 2001, to attend a public college or university for free for four years, provided a monthly housing stipend and covered up to $1,000 a year for books. Service members who agreed to serve four more years in the military had the option of transferring the benefit to their spouses or children. With the backing of numerous veterans groups, the bill was hailed as the most comprehensive educational benefits program since the original G.I. Bill was enacted in the World War II era. Obama, then a senator campaigning for president, supported the bill, along with most other members of Congress. It was opposed by President George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential candidate, who feared the generous education perk might hurt military retention. Obama voted for it when it came up in the Senate in May 2008, McCain was absent, and Bush ended up signing it into law. The benefits kicked in Aug. 1, 2009, after Obama had moved into the White House. As expected, tens of thousands of service members took advantage, and the Department of Veterans Affairs quickly fell behind in covering payments. Veterans reported having to take out loans to cover education costs while they waited for their checks from the government. According to news reports, the VA had mostly cleared the backlog by February of 2010. The expansion In December 2010, Congress passed another bill that enhanced the benefits of the new G.I. Bill. Dubbed "G.I. Bill 2.0," it expanded eligibility for reserve members and National Guard members who were activated after 9/11, allowed tuition benefits to be used beyond college campuses at vocational and on-the-job training programs and expanded the housing allowance to distance learners. The bill, the Post-9/11 Veterans Education Assistance Improvements Act of 2010, was signed by Obama on Jan. 4, 2011. When we contacted the White House for documentation of Michelle Obama’s statement, a spokesman provided us statistics on the 2008 law: * Approximately $15.02 billion in Post-9/11 GI Bill benefit payments. * 649,573 individuals have received benefits since August 1, 2009. * Fall enrollment is 428,870 individuals. Who gets the credit? Our key question about this claim is not whether veterans have been helped by the law, but whether Obama is the chief helper, as the First Lady's speech implied. We contacted veterans groups for their input. All agreed with the 500,000-plus figure Mrs. Obama mentioned. "In general, the numbers have gone up dramatically," said Robert Norton, a retired Army colonel and deputy director of government relations for the Military Officers Association of America. He noted that the legislation had broad bipartisan support in Congress and that Bush ended up supporting it because of the provision allowing benefits to be transferred to family members. But at that time, Obama was just one vote. Michael Dakduk, executive director of Student Veterans of America, said Obama "can take as much credit as every other politician in Congress in ‘07. (The new G.I. Bill) was supported by virtually everyone." He said it's a stretch to suggest Obama was the driving force. "It’s not appropriate. He doesn’t deserve that," Dakduk said. Tom Tarantino, senior legislative associate for Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, focused on the 2011 law. He said "it is fair to say that the president has been supportive of expanding benefits." Tarantino also credited the Obama administration with helping clear the backlog at the VA that left veterans waiting for their money. "When VA checks were late in the first semester, it was the White House that pressured (or directed) the VA to provide advances to veterans waiting for their living stipend. The White House has also been a driving force behind modernizing the VA benefits process that has resulted in an automated NGIB process that has had little to no late payments this school year," Tarantino said. Our ruling Michelle Obama said her husband has "helped more than half a million veterans and military family members go to college through the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill." Michelle Obama made it sound like the bill was a major legislative priority for him, but it was signed by his predecessor. Senator Obama voted for the new G.I. Bill. (And he wasn’t exactly going out on a political limb by favoring a law that enhanced benefits for military service members in the midst of two wars.) However, Obama did sign another bill in 2011 expanding benefits. The two laws together have helped more than 600,000 men and women returning from war find their way toward new careers, according to the VA. Obama deserves some credit for that achievement, but he's just one of many. We rate Michelle Obama's statement Half True.

pomt-12392	President Donald Trump "announced that he would reinstate a national day of remembrance for fallen officers that the traitor before him had done away with."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/may/30/blog-posting/pants-fire-bloggers-claim-obama-canceled-trump-rev/	A fake news story is tricking people into thinking that President Barack Obama canceled a national day of remembrance for fallen police officers. "Obama didn’t want to offend anyone, so our country’s heroes were shut out. Not anymore," reads a post on theexaminer.site that we also found on guerilla.news. "President Trump made Barack Obama look like a complete fool this morning in front of more than 10,000 police veterans when he announced that he would reinstate a national day of remembrance for fallen officers that the traitor before him had done away with," the story continues. The story then allegedly quotes Trump as saying, "Police officers in this country will no longer be treated like criminals. Obama decided your fallen didn’t deserve to be honored. That changes today. Americans will remember those that keep our streets safe big time." However, the Trump quote is fabricated, as is the premise of the story. The national day of remembrance for police officers killed in the line of the duty currently falls on May 15 each year. It is called Peace Officers Memorial Day. Obama did not cancel the day, and Trump did not reinstate it. It was started in 1962 by President John F. Kennedy as part of "police week." It has been celebrated by presidents -- including Obama and Trump -- ever since. Obama made remarks at a memorial service in May 2013, honoring the death of Jupiter, Fla., motorcycle police officer Bruce St. Laurent, who was struck and killed as part of a presidential motorcade in September 2012. "I have the privilege of working with some of the nation’s finest law enforcement officers and professionals every day," Obama said. "And I’m perpetually mindful of the sacrifices they make for me and for my family, and for other leaders and visiting dignitaries, but never more so than when I was told that Officer St. Laurent was struck and killed by another vehicle while driving his motorcycle as part of my motorcade." Obama also spoke at a memorial service in May 2015. "We are here to honor heroes who lost their lives in the line of duty -- men and women who put themselves in the way of danger, so that the rest of us could live in safety," Obama said in 2015. "They were beat cops, deputies, detectives, correctional and forest service officers, federal agents and tribal police. But to many here today, they went by different titles: caring husband, loving wife, my son, my daughter, Mom, Dad. We also found electronic copies of the proclamations Obama signed designating "police week" in 2014, 2015 and 2016. Trump, like other presidents, continued the tradition in 2017. He spoke at a memorial service but did not mention Obama. "America as a nation must always have the clarity to know the difference between good and evil, between right and wrong, and between those who uphold our laws and those who so easily break them," Trump said. "We owe it to the fallen to act according to our best and highest ideals. We owe it to their memory to put truth before politics, justice before agendas, and to put the safety and security of the American people above everything else." Theexaminer.site, where we saw this fake news story appear, includes no "about us" page. The post includes a disclaimer at the bottom referencing a different website, "Note: We at uspostman cannot make any warranties about the completeness, reliability and accuracy of this information."

pomt-07241	"If you look at the benefits and wages of recorded federal employees, they far outstrip the market rates of the private sector."	true	/virginia/statements/2011/may/31/eric-cantor/eric-cantor-says-benefits-and-salary-public-employ/	During a break from Congress last week, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor came home to hear from local business leaders. He got an earful, not all of it from the business community. As the forum wrapped up, Cantor was confronted by a few angry women, one of them shouting as she approached. They peppered Cantor with questions, and not liking the answers, one of them, a liberal activist with MoveOn.org, hurled insults. Another woman took a different tack. She explained to Cantor that a friend of hers had recently taken a government job in Washington and was receiving fuel subsidies for the commute. With the high price of gas, the woman asked why shouldn’t she be also receiving fuel subsidies. Cantor replied that there is an injustice between federal government and private sector employees that he is determined to correct. "If you look at the benefits and wages of recorded federal employees, they far outstrip the market rates of the private sector," he said. Do they? We thought it was worth a look. To substantiate the claim, Cantor’s office sent over a few sources including a widely referenced 2010 investigation of federal versus private pay from USA Today. The newspaper probe relied on 2009 data (still the most current available) from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis. It showed that federal civil servants received average pay and benefits of $123,049 while private workers made $61,051 in total compensation. According to USA Today, federal civilian employees received an average salary of $81,258 and benefits worth $41,791. Private-sector workers got $50,462 in pay and $10,589 in benefits. Officials from public employee unions and some economists dismiss the compensation comparisons. They say the gap reflects the increasingly high level of skill and education required for most federal jobs and the government contracting out many lower-paying jobs to the private sector. Another report by USA Today focused on salaries alone. It compared the 2008 pay for 40 occupations that exist in both the federal government and private sector, as defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Federal employees earned an average salary of $67,691 while private workers, in the same mix of jobs were paid an average $60,046. That’s a difference of $7,645. There are arguments on the other side when it comes to pay alone, however. Late last year, an annual report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to the Federal Salary Council concluded that federal civilian workers on average are paid 2.1 percent less than private workers. But as a piece from our friends at FactCheck.org pointed out late last year, experts say there are flaws in the methodology there that prevent a true apples-to-apples comparison. Howard Risher, the managing consultant on a detailed 1990 report on pay differences recently recently wrote in Government Executive magazine, there’s no way of truly knowing which sector receives higher salaries because "neither has detailed job-to-job comparisons to support their arguments." All of that is well and fine, but it still doesn’t put a dent in Cantor’s claim, which looks at wages and benefits together. All parties agree that federal benefits are far more generous than those in the private sector. Gary Burtless, a labor economist with the left-leaning Brookings Institution, says there are good reasons why federal employees are better compensated the private-sector workers. Federal employees typically to do more specialized work that requires more education and responsibility than their private-sector peers, he said. Federal workers also often have served longer in their positions than private employees, he added. "To be surprised that federal workers receive average higher compensation than average private-sector workers is like being surprised when informed that school teachers are paid more than McDonalds’ employees," Burtless said. Still, as the USA Today study found, federal pay was higher than private-sector pay in four out of every five job categories that existed in both sectors. These included accountants, nurses, chemists, public relations specialists, surveyors, cooks, clerks and janitors. And, as Chris Edwards, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute notes, federal pay has risen faster than private-sector pay in recent years, despite the recession. "BEA data show that average federal salaries rose 58 percent between 2000 and 2009, which was much faster than the 30 percent increase in the private sector," Edwards writes. So let’s look back. Cantor claims that the "benefits and wages" of federal employees far outstrips those of the private sector. On average, that’s true; total compensation for federal workers is nearly double the private sector average. Looking at salary alone narrows the divide a bit, and some argues private pay even exceeds federal pay, but Cantor played it safe by avoiding specific numbers and including benefits. As some suggest, there may be solid reasons for the disparity -- expertise, education requirements, responsibility, seniority -- but that doesn’t change the facts. We rate the claim True.

pomt-03426	Under Republican-backed state budget, the state education agency estimates expansion of Wisconsin’s school voucher program "could cost nearly $2 billion annually"	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jun/26/peter-barca/nearly-2-billion-year-expand-school-vouchers-state/	As Republican Wisconsin lawmakers crafted the 2013-15 state budget, outraged Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca sent out a fund-raising plea. Seeking contributions to the Assembly Democratic Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats to the Assembly, Barca blasted the work of the GOP-controlled Joint Finance Committee on the two-year tax-and-spending plan. In a June 5, 2013 email, the Kenosha Democrat decried the proposed creation of a private bail bond system and a $651 million income tax cut. Then he turned to a proposed expansion of the private school voucher program. Citing a figure from the state Department of Public Instruction, Barca said the budget included: "An expansion of taxpayer-funded, unaccountable private school vouchers across the state, which DPI estimated could cost nearly $2 billion annually." That’s a lot of money. The figure caught our attention because Barca’s email was on the 2013-15 budget; the $651 million income tax cut, for example, refers to how much income taxes will be reduced over the two-year period. On the school voucher expansion Barca criticized, the budget awaiting Gov. Scott Walker’s signature limits to 1,500 the number of students who could be added to the program during the two-year cycle. Could that expansion really cost taxpayers nearly $2 billion per year? Not even close. Barca’s evidence Long a subject of controversy, the voucher program, also known as school choice, was launched in 1990 in Milwaukee and was extended to the Racine area in 2011. It is intended to improve results for poor city children in public schools by allowing them to attend private or religious schools with publicly funded vouchers. Barca spokeswoman Melanie Conklin told us her boss based his nearly $2 billion claim on an email that state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Evers sent to school district superintendents and other educators six days before Barca's fund-raising email. Evers, who opposes the voucher expansion, wrote: "While the current proposal includes an initial enrollment cap, past history clearly demonstrates those are temporary at best. We estimate that vouchers on a statewide scale could ultimately cost up to $1.9 billion annually,further diverting scarce resources away from public schools and increasing local property taxes." To be clear, the $1.9 billion-per-year estimate applies to the total cost of the voucher program, not the limited expansion that would take place over the next two years with the new budget. Moreover, Evers' use of ultimately dooms Barca’s claim. While Barca's fund-raising email was about the 2013-15 budget, the $1.9 billion cost estimate is for some time in the future. Barca's spokeswoman also forwarded us another Evers email, which referenced a detailed DPI estimate. It says the voucher expansion cost could reach $1.9 billion per year if 20 percent of students statewide -- nearly 193,000 students -- enrolled in the voucher program. That's far more than the 25,000 voucher students currently in the program and the 1,500 that would be added in the next two years. DPI spokesman John Johnson told us that with the expansion provided for in the 2013-15 budget, the voucher program will cost about $385 million over the two years. That's an average of about $192.5 million per year. A far cry from what Barca led the recipients of his email to believe. A footnote before we close: A little noticed provision in the budget could potentially allow for expansion beyond the 1,500 students. But even if that expansion occurs, the additional cost is estimated at only $4 million in the 2013-15 budget, Johnson said. Moreover, the disclosure didn’t come until two weeks after Barca’s email. Our rating Criticizing a Republican-backed expansion of the school voucher program in the 2013-15 state budget, Barca said the state Department of Public Instruction estimated that the expansion "could cost nearly $2 billion annually." But the cost of the entire voucher program -- not just the expansion -- averages $192.5 million per year for the 2013-15 budget cycle. DPI's $1.9 billion-per-year estimate is not based on the 2013-15 expansion; it would only apply if the voucher program expands dramatically years down the road. The money exaggeration may make for good copy when it comes to raising money. But when it comes to math, it’s a major failure. We rate Barca's statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-08268	"I had five of my citizens that were killed last week" because of border security problems.	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/nov/10/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-said-five-his-citizens-were-killed-/	Which has been Gov. Rick Perry's favorite fight — flicking off Democratic challenger Bill White or saving the states from Washington? He has talked more about states' rights lately, in part via a busy campaign to promote his new book, Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America from Washington. On Comedy Central's "The Daily Show" Monday night, host Jon Stewart wondered whether Perry would be "more comfortable with the United States under the Articles of the Confederation," a reference to the first constitution of the United States. Perry responded: "What I'm really comfortable with is Washington understanding that they're doing too much. I'd like for them to do their basic responsibilities like secure our border with Mexico. I had five of my citizens that were killed last week. I've asked two administrations to put the boots on the ground, to secure that border." Perry has often talked up his requests for more National Guard troops on the Texas border. In a February 2009 letter to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, he asked for an "additional 1,000 Title 32 National Guard positions." And in April, we rated Half True Perry's claim that "we've got a 1,000 National Guard troop request that's been in front of this president for over a year and no response." But the governor's mention of slain Texans to bolster his calls for more border security was new to us, and we wondered which citizens Perry was citing. Responding to our request for elaboration, Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier sent us a link to a Nov. 5 article on CNN.com naming six U.S. citizens who were killed last week on the Mexico side of the border near El Paso. CNN reported that Eder Diaz Sotero and Manuel Acosta, both American students at the University of Texas at El Paso, were killed in Ciudad Juarez on Nov. 2, according to the U.S. Consulate in that city. CNN reported that the two students were "gunned down in a hail of more than 30 bullets while driving in Chihuahua State." Four more U.S. citizens were shot to death in Ciudad Juarez (adjoining El Paso) the weekend of Oct. 29, according to CNN and other news reports: a woman who was shot inside a tortilla shop; a man and woman who were shot in a car near the Zaragoza International Bridge connecting Juarez to El Paso; and a man who died of multiple gunshot wounds outside a house. It was the deadliest weekend for Americans in Mexico since February, according to a Nov. 2 Associated Press story published in the Austin American-Statesman. Separately, we reviewed other news reports indicating that six U.S. citizens have been killed in Juarez since Oct. 30. The St. Petersburg Times reported that they were from El Paso. As we completed this article, Nicole Thompson, a spokeswoman at the U.S. Department of State, confirmed to us that six U.S. citizens have been killed recently in Juarez. Summing up: Perry was one short in recounting the six Americans from El Paso killed in Ciudad Juarez since little over a week ago — presumably missing the sixth because there was a delay before the U.S. Consulate confirmed the American identity of one of the slain students.

pomt-11970	"Las Vegas shooting witnesses report multiple gunmen dressed as security guards."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/oct/03/blog-posting/blog-peddles-fake-story-saying-security-guards-idd/	An online website that describes itself as "free independent news" is pushing a false story that a Las Vegas shooting victim saw multiple gunmen dressed as security guards at Mandalay Bay. One of the more pervasive conspiracy-minded claims spinning around the Internet is that the Las Vegas shooting was some type of staged attack or that there were multiple gunmen. As of this writing, there is no evidence any of that is true. However, the website Neon Nettle claimed that an eyewitness to the shooting reported "multiple gunmen dressed as security guards." "As the mainstream media in the US attempts to lock down the ‘crazy lone wolf gunman’ narrative for the devastating shooting attack in Las Vegas, the truth has started to seep through foreign news outlets who don't follow the same political agenda as the American MSM," the post, dated Oct. 3, 2017, reads. The post goes on to tell the story of Brian Hodge, an Australian who was reportedly staying on the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay, the same floor as the shooter. The story talks about an Oct. 2 interview Hodge gave to the Courier Mail, an Australian tabloid. In that article, Hodge said he hid in the bushes outside the casino hotel until police arrived. "There were multiple people dead and multiple shooters. I was just hiding waiting for police to come get us," Hodge is quoted as saying. Later, Hodge said: "My floor is a crime scene. They killed a security guard on my floor." While there are some reports a security guard was shot, we are unable to confirm if that’s accurate. And while Hodge is quoted as saying shooters plural, there is no evidence he’d have any way of knowing. In fact, Hodge gave an interview to the Sydney Morning Herald in which he more fully describes what he saw. Hodge told that newspaper that he never made it to his room on the 32nd floor and after hearing the bullets he first went to a casino kitchen before hiding in a bush outside. "I was just laying on the ground. It was like a scene from a movie. The shooter was up above, we didn't know where they were... I didn't want anyone to know where I was, so I just curled up and hid. It was the most terrifying moment of my life." Hodge also posted on Facebook, "There is a live shooter with a gun in my hotel in Vegas right now, but I got outside safely and hiding in bushes." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com More importantly for this fact-check, it’s clear to us the Neon Nettle post puts words in Hodge’s mouth. Hodge never said in the Courier Mail article nor in any other article or social media post that the security guard was a shooter. And he also disputed saying shooters. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling An online blog claims, "Las Vegas shooting witnesses report multiple gunmen dressed as security guards." The story tracks back to real interviews given by a person who says he was at Mandalay Bay. But beyond that, this story doesn’t hold up. The witness didn’t say what the blog claims.

pomt-06639	Under President Barack Obama’s jobs bill, "you can sue if you are unemployed and don't get the job and think you weren't hired because you are unemployed."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/15/sean-hannity/sean-hannity-says-barack-obamas-jobs-bill-creates-/	During the Sept. 13, 2011, edition of Sean Hannity’s show on the Fox News Channel, Hannity said that President Barack Obama’s jobs bill included a new way for Americans to sue for discrimination. In a discussion with former Florida State University football coach Bobby Bowden and Tucker Carlson, the editor of the Daily Caller, a conservative website, Hannity said that, under the bill, unemployed people would be able to sue for discrimination if they felt their status had kept them from getting a job. "There is a class where they could sue the employer they've interviewed with because they were discriminated against, because they were unemployed," Hannity said. "If I'm an employer and they implement that, I'm not going to interview anybody." Carlson added, "There's a new category to the Civil Rights Act with race, ethnicity." Hannity continued, "You can sue if you are unemployed and don't get the job and think you weren't hired because you are unemployed." Carlson replied that such a provision was a "giveaway to the trial lawyers." "We've gone entitlement crazy," Bowden said. "We have," Hannity agreed. We were curious about whether Hannity described the proposal correctly. We began by turning to the bill itself. The provision in question follows news reports that some companies have rejected unemployed job applicants out of hand as a way of filtering the large numbers of job resumes they’re receiving. In some cases, companies even made it clear in advertisements that they would not consider applicants who were unemployed. Since unemployment levels have remained stuck for months at near post-Great Depression highs, such practices posed a challenge for an administration that desperately wants to boost employment. So the bill states the overarching position that "denial of employment opportunities to individuals because of their status as unemployed is discriminatory." Specifically, the bill prohibits employers from publishing help-wanted ads that disqualify people who are unemployed, and bars employers from failing to consider or hire an individual "because of the individual's status as unemployed." The bill places similar restrictions on employment agencies. As for enforcement of the new provision, the bill says that "a court of the United States shall have the same jurisdiction and powers as the court has to enforce ... Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964" -- the landmark provision that bans employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin. An individual who seeks redress through the courts, the bill says, "may be awarded, as appropriate" an order to employers to stop the prohibited practices, "reimbursement of costs expended as a result of the unlawful employment practice," damages up to $1,000 for each day of the violation, and "reasonable attorney’s fees." Lynne Bernabei, a Washington employment lawyer best known for representing whistleblowers, agreed that Hannity described the law accurately, though she said that individuals suing under the new provisions -- if they are ultimately enacted as written -- will still face a steep climb in the courts before they secure any compensation. "Any individual suing under this law has to prove that he was discriminated against because he was unemployed," Bernabei said. "Discrimination is always difficult to prove, and it wouldn't be any easier to prove in this context." But Hannity didn’t suggest that plaintiffs would somehow be assured of winning in court; he simply said that they would have the opportunity to sue. We rate Hannity’s statement True.

pomt-06989	Because of Democratic tax hikes, New Jersey ended a decade with fewer private sector jobs for the first time in recorded history.	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jul/12/steve-oroho/sen-steve-oroho-claims-democratic-tax-hikes-are-bl/	Amid the recent budget battle raging between Democratic legislators and Gov. Chris Christie, Republican Sen. Steve Oroho offered an interesting lesson in how New Jersey had already made history when it comes to private-sector job losses during the last decade. In a June 29 press release, Oroho criticized the fiscal year 2012 budget passed by the Democratic majority, but later scaled back by Christie and argued that Democratic tax hikes during the past 10 years contributed to those job losses. In fact, Oroho said the last decade was the "first time in recorded history" that the state had fewer private-sector jobs at the end than at the beginning of the decade. "Over the past 10 years, the Democrat majority have been intent on pushing through dramatic tax increases, and irresponsible budget gimmicks to fund an insatiable desire to spend taxpayer dollars," said Oroho, who represents Sussex County and parts of Hunterdon and Morris counties. Oroho added, "It is no coincidence that during this same period it was the first time in recorded history where the state had less private sector jobs at the end of the decade than we had at the beginning." PolitiFact New Jersey soon learned that Oroho’s statistic is accurate -- New Jersey had a net loss of private-sector jobs in a decade for the first time since payroll employment statistics were first collected. But the causes go beyond the tax increases imposed by Democrats, according to economic experts. First, let’s talk about where Oroho received his information. Oroho directed us to a May 3, 2010 article on NJ Spotlight written by James Hughes and Joseph Seneca of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick. The article points to a net loss of 156,100 private-sector jobs between 2000 and 2010, marking the first such reduction for a decade since 1939. Hughes, dean of the Bloustein school, told us their analysis was based on state and federal employment data from December 1999 to December 2009. Following our own review of data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, we reached a similar conclusion. For non-seasonally adjusted figures, New Jersey lost 152,700 private-sector jobs between December 1999 and December 2009, or about 4 percent, according to the federal data. Every other decade dating to 1939 saw private-sector job increases of between 8 percent and 26 percent, according to the federal data for non-seasonally adjusted figures. "We’ve never had a decade where we lost private-sector jobs before," Hughes said. So Oroho is right about that history lesson, but how much blame should be given to the tax hikes? After talking to experts and taking a closer look at the private-sector job numbers between December 1999 and December 2009, we found a major element missing from Oroho’s statement: the recession. According to federal data for non-seasonally adjusted figures, New Jersey saw private-sector job growth annually between 2003 and 2007. Then between 2008 and 2009 -- after the recession had hit -- the state lost 226,800 private-sector jobs, according to federal data. Bill Rodgers, chief economist at the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University, argued that the recession and the weak recovery preceding it had a greater impact on job losses. "The taxes are not the main contributor," Rodgers said. Oroho acknowledged that other factors contributed to the job losses, including the general downturn in the economy, but he said the tax increases turned away capital investment, leading to the private-sector job losses. Those tax hikes included increases in the income, sales and corporate business taxes, according to the senator. "Capital’s like water," Oroho said. "It follows the path of least resistance." Hughes agreed that the tax hikes increased the cost of doing business in New Jersey and affected job figures. He also noted the impact of corruption scandals, saying: "Corporations don’t want to be near controversy." Michael Riccards, executive director of Trenton-based The Hall Institute of Public Policy, argued that tax hikes were not a major cause behind the job losses. The global economy and poor business practices in certain industries contributed to the loss of jobs, Riccards said. Let’s review: Pointing to Democratic tax hikes, Oroho said the last decade marked the first time since 1939 that New Jersey ended a decade with fewer private-sector jobs than it started with. He’s right, based on research by Rutgers professors and our own analysis of federal data. But given the impact of the recession on job losses -- and as the senator acknowledges himself -- tax hikes are not the only factors involved. We rate his statement Barely True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-01667	Jason Carter backed three of Nathan Deal’s budgets but accuses the governor of "underfunding education."	true	/georgia/statements/2014/aug/20/john-padgett/gop-chair-correct-carter-voted-3-4-deal-budgets/	Education. It’s the single biggest expense in the state budget (This year alone, the cost of k-12 education is $7.9 billion, or 43.4 percent of the state’s $18.3 billion budget). And it’s one of the biggest issues in this year’s closely watched governor’s race. On Aug. 12, Republicans issued a statement attacking Jason Carter, the Democratic state senator who is hoping to wrestle the job of governor from Republican Nathan Deal. Sonny Perdue, Deal’s predecessor, in 2003 became Georgia’s first Republican governor since Reconstruction. The GOP now controls the Georgia House, Senate and all major statewide offices. Democrats see Carter, a two-term state senator from the Decatur area and former President Jimmy Carter’s grandson, as their best chance for regaining a foothold. "How can Carter criticize Gov. Deal for 'underfunding' education when he backed three of (Deal’s) budgets?" John Padgett, chairman of the Georgia Republican Party, said in the press release. The release goes on to accuse Carter, 39, of playing politics -- voting for Deal’s first three state budgets, but against Deal’s last budget after announcing as a candidate for governor. All four budgets included major, so-called austerity cuts to education. "He (Carter) thinks that with enough rhetoric he can hide the fact that he cares more about advancing his own career than improving the education system in Georgia," Padgett said in the statement. The party chair is parroting a claim that Deal’s campaign has been making. PolitiFact decided it was time to fact-check Carter’s voting record on the state budgets. Carter has voiced concerns about the state’s commitment to public education during most of his short Senate career. His criticism, specifically of Deal on education, has sharpened in recent months, with his campaign manager at one point calling Deal Georgia’s worst education governor. (See PolitiFact’s Pants On Fire ruling of that claim.) For our current fact check, we started at the General Assembly website, where the votes of lawmakers on all bills -- including state budgets -- are public. We confirmed that Carter voted "Yes" with the majority in the Senate for Deal’s fiscal 2012, 2013 and 2014 budgets. Austerity cuts to education in each of those budgets exceeded $1 billion. In this year’s General Assembly session, only four out of 56 state senators voted against the 2015 budget. Gubernatorial candidate Carter cast one of those "No" votes. Austerity cuts were part of the 2015 budget. But at $747 million, they were the smallest since 2009 and, as such, viewed as largely positive by leaders in education. --------------------------------------------------- Austerity Cuts to K-12 education 2011-2015 2011 $1,089,521,696 2012 $1,147,859,436 2013 $1,143,762,797 2014 $1,061,127,407 2015 $746,769,852 Total 2003-2015 $8,436,724,814 Source: Allotment sheets, Georgia Department of Education Since 2003, governors and lawmakers haven’t fully funded schools based on the state’s education funding formula. These austerity cuts have totaled $8.4 billion, according to reports filed with the Georgia Department of Education. In combination with plummeting property tax collections -- fallout from the national housing market collapse -- the austerity cuts have thrown many of the state’s 180 school systems into a tailspin. As a result, there have been staff reductions, unpaid furlough days, larger class sizes and, in many cases, shorter school years. Carter has explained his decision to vote this year against Deal’s budget. At one of his back-to-back school tours last week, the Democrat said the 2015 funding boost was election-year politicking to mask the governor’s "dismantling" of public education. "The governor on average has underfunded our schools by $1 billion each year, and the claim that they have done enough is just not true," Carter said. "The $750 million shortfall into the education fund this year is not something I support." He would not comment about his three prior votes for Deal’s budget when contacted by PolitiFact. In an email, Bryan Thomas, Carter’s spokesman, reiterated many of the candidate’s past criticisms of Deal’s handling of k-12 education, as well as the popular HOPE scholarship program. "Governor Deal has shortchanged our schools by an average of $1 billion a year since taking office," Thomas said. "He likes to brag about his election-year budget, but he still missed the mark by more than $750 million." In November, Thomas said, voters can choose "between a governor who only seems to care about schools in an election year, or Jason, whose commitment to our schools has never wavered." (State education funding has increased during Deal's tenure, in part due to enrollment growth. Budget reports show K-12 spending has increased from $7.067 billion when he took office to $7.94 billion this year.) Carter, who was member of a special Senate task force on education in 2012, has said, if elected governor, he would push to create a separate education budget that would be tantamount to an untouchable trust fund for schools. In summary, John Padgett, GOP state chairman, was correct. Jason Carter voted in favor of three of Gov. Nathan Deal’s state budgets that each included $1 billion-plus in austerity cuts to education. Carter voted this year against a fourth, annual state budget proposed by Deal that included about $747 million in austerity cuts to K-12 education, the smallest cut since 2009.

pomt-05323	Says that President Obama promised that with the stimulus plan, "unemployment would never go above 8 percent. He even said it would be 6 percent by now."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2012/may/17/bob-latta/bob-latta-says-obama-promised-stimulus-plan-would-/	For almost three years, going back to mid-2009, a top talking point for Republicans has been that President Obama "promised" that the stimulus bill -- the two-year spending package he championed to revive the economy -- would keep unemployment below 8 percent. PolitiFact has examined the claim numerous times, and each time rated it Mostly False. But the claim still circulates. We heard it most recently from Rep. Bob Latta of Bowling Green, who represents Ohio's 5th District, with a new wrinkle. In a campaign statement endorsing Mitt Romney and criticizing the "broken promises" of Obama, Latta writes: "President Obama promised Americans that his stimulus plan would revitalize the economy and that unemployment would never go above 8 percent. He even said it would be 6 percent by now." The claim about current unemployment being 6 percent added something new. We asked Latta's office how he backed it up. As support for both the 6 percent and 8 percent figures, they pointed to a Jan. 9, 2009, report called "The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan" from Christina Romer, then chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, the vice president's top economic adviser. The report, which others also have cited, projected that the stimulus plan proposed by Obama would create 3 million to 4 million jobs by the end of 2010. The report also included a chart predicting unemployment rates with and without the stimulus. Without the stimulus (the baseline), unemployment was projected to hit about 8.5 percent in 2009 and then continue rising to a peak of about 9 percent in 2010. With the stimulus, they predicted the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009. The chart projects the current unemployment rate at about 6 percent with the stimulus, and about 6.5 percent without it. As Latta's staff rightly noted, the unemployment rate went higher. It peaked at just above 10 percent in early 2010 before falling to 8.1 percent in the most recent period. But what we saw from the administration in January 2009, before Obama took office, was a projection, not a promise. We could find no instance of anyone in the administration directly making a public promise. And the projection came with heavy disclaimers. "It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error," the report states. "There is the more fundamental uncertainty that comes with any estimate of the effects of a program. Our estimates of economic relationships and rules of thumb are derived from historical experience and so will not apply exactly in any given episode. Furthermore, the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity." A footnote that goes with the chart states: "Forecasts of the unemployment rate without the recovery plan vary substantially. Some private forecasters anticipate unemployment rates as high as 11 percent in the absence of action." The administration has acknowledged its projections were wrong. "None of us had a crystal ball back in December and January," Romer said in a July 2, 2009 interview on Fox. "I think almost every private forecaster realized that there were other things going on in the economy. It was worse than we anticipated." Indeed, in January 2009, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected the unemployment rate would climb to 8.3 percent in 2009 and peak at 9 percent in 2010. By February, the prediction was even higher — 9 percent in 2009 without the stimulus, and 7.7 to 8.5 percent with a stimulus. In a White House news conference on June 8, 2009, Bernstein said the projections made in January were off because economic numbers for fourth-quarter 2008 weren't yet available. When they were released, they revealed the economy was in worse shape than economists realized. The baseline -- the prediction of what the economy would have done without the stimulus -- was far too optimistic The implication of Latta's statement is that rising unemployment rates prove the stimulus didn't work. Many economists don't agree -- and argue that without the stimulus, unemployment would have been worse -- but it's difficult to empirically prove one way or the other. There is an element of truth here: The incoming administration did predict that unemployment would peak at just under 8 percent if Congress approved the stimulus package and that it would be about 6 percent now. But Latta's statement suggests Obama was offering some sort of guarantee. The administration never characterized it that way and included plenty of disclaimers saying the predictions had "significant margins of error" and a higher degree of uncertainty due to a recession that is "unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity." It was an economic projection with warnings of a high margin for error, not a take-it-to-the-bank pledge of an upper limit on unemployment. Those are critical facts that Latta’s claim ignores. On the Truth-O-Meter, Latta’s claim rates Mostly False.	None	Bob Latta	None	None	None	2012-05-17T06:00:00	2012-05-05	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-13783	"Just 9 percent of Muslims in Pakistan view ISIS favorably. Unfortunately, that 9 percent is 16 million people. And that’s just one country."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/20/newt-gingrich/gingrich-9-pakistanis-support-isis/	Newt Gingrich wanted to make clear in his speech at the Republican National Convention that the majority of Muslims are peaceful. But, he said, it only takes a few bad apples ... If even a small percentage of the world’s billion Muslims support violence, "that is still a giant recruiting base," Gingrich said. "Pew Research finds that just 9 percent of Muslims in Pakistan view ISIS favorably," Gingrich said. "Unfortunately, that 9 percent is 16 million people. And that’s just one country." Gingrich has done his math well. A 2015 Pew report found that views of ISIS were "overwhelmingly negative" in a survey that included 10 Muslim majority nations. But Pakistan was an outlier. "One exception was Pakistan, where a majority offered no definite opinion of ISIS," the report said. "Only 28 percent in Pakistan had an unfavorable view of ISIS, and a majority of Pakistanis (62%) had no opinion on the extremist group." As this chart in the report showed, 9 percent of Pakistanis said they had a favorable view of ISIS. (The question was "Do you have a ____ opinion of the Islamic militant group in Iraq and Syria known as ISIS?) The population of Pakistan was about 199 million in 2015, according to the CIA. The country is 98 percent Muslim. Take 9 percent of the total and you get nearly 18 million people. One could say that just because they have a favorable view of ISIS, that doesn’t mean they would fight for ISIS. Their answers might have been different if they had been asked if they support ISIS, rather than think favorably of them. But Gingrich used the stat to show that the terrorist group enjoyed a large recruiting base. Even if a small fraction of the 9 percent were willing to take up arms or commit acts of terror, that would be a large number. Our ruling Gingrich said that just 9 percent of Muslims in Pakistan view ISIS favorably and that amounts to 16 million people. There are a some small issues with his statement. He got the numbers right but we don’t know how that might translate into a readiness to commit violence in the name of ISIS. Also, the survey was of all Pakistanis, not just Muslims. However, none of those details undermine Gingrich’s point. The data suggest there is large number of people who are inclined to respond to ISIS’ message. We rate this claim Mostly True. Correction, Sept. 12, 2016: This report has been changed to accurately reflect Gingrich’s quote. He said, "Pew Research finds that just 9 percent of Muslims in Pakistan view ISIS favorably," not "Pew Research finds that just 9 percent of Muslims in Pakistan support ISIS."

pomt-09786	The Baucus bill "contains provisions that would send massive federal subsidies directly to both private insurance plans and government-chartered cooperatives that pay for elective abortion."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/21/national-right-life-committee/national-right-life-committee-says-baucus-bill-wou/	With the recent release of the Senate Finance Committee plan for health care reform, the abortion issue has re-emerged in the health care debate. And both sides are choosing their words carefully to score political points. We are examining two seemingly similar statements from the National Right to Life Committee that we think get to the heart of the rhetoric. One is that under the bill proposed by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., federal funds (tax dollars) would subsidize abortions; and the other is that federal subsidies would go to insurance companies that offer abortion coverage. They sound similar, but we ended up with rulings at opposite ends of our Truth-O-Meter. We take a look at the first claim, that federal tax dollars would subsidize abortions, in a separate item and conclude the statement is False . In this item, we deal with a statement from NLRC legislative director Douglas Johnson that the Baucus bill "contains provisions that would send massive federal subsidies directly to both private insurance plans and government-chartered cooperatives that pay for elective abortion." If you look carefully, the issue here is government involvement in plans that offer abortion. And that's a big deal. The 1976 Hyde Amendment prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions through Medicaid except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's health is in peril. So states that want to offer abortion coverage have to pay for it themselves. Similar restrictions on public funding for abortions applies to federal health care coverage extended to active and retired military and federal employees. Baucus said he attempted to "find language that just maintains the status quo" on abortion, because he didn't want the issue to be a distraction. "This is a health care bill, not an abortion bill," Baucus said. Maintaining the status quo, however, is a matter of perception. And that's because there are two competing realities. On the one hand, as President Barack Obama acknowledged in a July 21 interview, "We ... have a tradition of, in this town, historically, of not financing abortions as part of government-funded health care." In other words, the more than 250 private health plans that cover federal employees — because they are subsidized by the federal government — cannot offer full abortion services. On the other hand, many private plans (outside the government) currently offer abortion services. If the government starts providing health care subsidies but bans the participation of any plan that offers abortion services (as some legislators have suggested), abortion rights groups argue it would strip millions of women of benefits they currently get. According to a 2002 Guttmacher Institute study, 87 percent of employment-based insured health plans offered coverage for abortions (though not all companies select it for their employees). A 2003 Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that 46 percent of covered workers had coverage for abortions. The two surveys asked different questions, but the bottom line is that a significant percentage of women have health insurance that covers abortions. According to Baucus' chairman's mark, which provides a blueprint for the plan, abortion cannot be a mandated as part of any minimum benefits package except in cases of rape, incest or if the mother's life is in danger. However, health plans in the exchange or co-op would not be prohibited from providing abortion coverage. In fact, every state exchange would have to provide one plan that covers abortion and one that does not. The exchange is a virtual marketplace where people can comparison shop for an insurance plan. Baucus' alternative to a public option, a co-op, would be one alternative on the exchange (think of it as a credit union for health insurance). The plan provides federal dollars — through tax credits or cost-sharing credits — to subsidize the cost of insurance for people with modest incomes. So clearly, you'd have federal subsidies going to plans that cover abortions. But no more federal money would go to plans that offer abortion, so the added cost would presumably be passed on to consumers who choose plans that offer abortion, and efforts have been made to segregate funding so that only money from premiums — not tax dollars — would be used to pay for abortions. But if millions of uninsured people would now get insurance due to the health care plan, and some of the plans offer abortion coverage, we think it's fair to conclude the Baucus plan (or any other Democratic plan under consideration) would mean more women would have access to abortion services. That obviously doesn't sit well with National Right to Life and other antiabortion groups. Johnson said they'd like to see an amendment that would prohibit any insurer that gets federal subsidies from offering abortion services. Amendments to that effect failed in the House. The plan, as proposed, would lead to more abortion coverage, and therefore more abortions, Johnson said. The Hyde Amendment, he said, is "one of the most important abortion reduction policies adopted by Congress." Not only can't the federal government subsidize abortion, he said, it can’t subsidize plans that offer abortion. The Baucus bill, he said, is "a big departure from where we are now." Here's Planned Parenthood's take on the Baucus plan: "Planned Parenthood acknowledges that there are some compromises that need to be made to move health care reform forward, and we are willing to do so if it means more women can access affordable, quality health care from the provider of their choice. While we are concerned that the language in the Senate Finance Bill specifically singles out abortion, we understand it is necessary to move health care reform forward. "As it currently stands, it is a carefully crafted compromise which assures that access to abortion would neither be mandated nor prohibited — and that women would not lose health care benefits that they have had for decades, while also addressing concerns that no federal funds would be used for abortion." In the abortion debate, nothing is simple. And as we said, words are chosen carefully. Regarding Johnson's claim that the Baucus plan would result in "federal subsidies directly to both private insurance plans and government-chartered cooperatives that pay for elective abortion," we think he is on solid ground. One could argue whether or not this is a departure from making the bill "abortion neutral" — each side has its take on that — but the fact is the plan would allow insurers to offer abortion. And the plan includes federal subsidies to some who might choose to join such a plan. And so we rule Johnson's statement True.

pomt-03215	Says "your Legislative Assembly was within one vote of enacting each of those bills into Oregon law."	false	/oregon/statements/2013/aug/24/doug-whitsett/was-oregon-legislature-within-one-vote-enacting-fi/	If you think back, you might remember a time during the 2013 legislative session when there were talks about a slate of measures to help curb gun violence. But much like the gun control debate on the national stage, nothing came to pass and the issue was largely abandoned. In a recent opinion piece for conservative political blog Oregon Catalyst, Sen. Doug Whitsett, a Republican from Klamath Falls, says, if not for one vote, the whole gun control narrative could have been completely different. "More than a dozen bills relating to firearms were introduced during the recently concluded 77th Legislative Assembly," he wrote. "Most of those bills would have, in some way, impinged upon our second amendment right to own and bear firearms." He then listed seven of them and continued: "Your Legislative Assembly was within one vote of enacting each of those bills into Oregon law. It was within one vote of grossly impinging on our second amendment rights." That’s quite the statement. We decided to take a look. Whitsett argues that the Senate was deadlocked on this issue. There were 14 Republicans in the Senate, all of whom were opposed to the gun legislation. If the 16 Democrats had all voted in favor, the legislation would have passed. But, he notes, Sen. Betsy Johnson, a Democrat from Scappoose, was opposed. Hers was the vote that kept these bills from becoming law. That strikes us an oversimplification of the process. We looked at the measure history for each of these seven bills he’d mentioned by number. Two of the measures -- the only two he mentions that originated in the House -- never got hearings in their committees. It’s a stretch to say they were a single vote from becoming law when they never even made it out of committee, let alone to the Senate, where Johnson serves. One Senate bill was in a similar situation. Four other Senate bills he mentioned did get hearings and were all passed out of committees with recommendations that they be passed by the full Senate. However, Senate President Peter Courtney sent them all to the Rules Committee where they died a quiet death. By Whitsett’s account, the reason they were sent off to die in Rules was that Courtney knew they had no chance of passing, thanks to the Republicans -- plus Johnson. "It was my understanding that had we not had 15 ‘no’ votes in the Senate, they would have passed with flying colors," Whitsett said. Without Johnson "it would have been the typical 16-14 party line vote." He may be right on certain bills. Johnson definitely helped defeat Senate Bill 700, which would have expanded background checks for gun purchases, as The Oregonian’s Jeff Mapes reported. Even so, that bill and the others would have had to make it through the House. Whitsett said he was under the impression the House had the votes to pass the gun bills. We can’t know for sure. House Speaker Tina Kotek had made it clear that jobs and schools were her priorities, not guns. We chatted with Sen. Ginny Burdick, D-Portland, one of the most vocal supporters of the various gun-control bills. She said Whitsett was right that the unified Republican opposition certainly helped table the subject. Still, Burdick added, had those bills made it out of the Senate, there was no sure bet they’d make it through the House, too. "The background checks bill would have had a very good chance," she said, referring to Senate Bill 700. "The other ones would have had a little tougher time." Whitsett said that gun-control advocates were within "one vote of enacting each" of the seven bills into law. Had he focused on Senate Bill 700 specifically, we might be inclined to agree. But some of the other bills did not even receive a hearing and there is no guarantee that others would have passed in the Senate, let alone received the 31 votes needed in the House. We rate this claim False.	None	Doug Whitsett	None	None	None	2013-08-24T06:00:00	2013-08-16	['Oregon']
pomt-05546	Says in the governor’s proposed budget "the use of that, what is called one-shots, is a 500 percent increase over the last Corzine budget."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/apr/09/john-burzichelli/john-burzichelli-claims-chris-christies-proposed-b/	New Jersey has for years patched its budget holes with one-time fixes, mending deficits with temporary tax increases or the use of surplus funds. Now, Gov. Chris Christie says he is weaning the state off such volatile resources, known as one-shots. But a Democratic lawmaker tells a different story. Assemblyman John Burzichelli, who represents parts of Cumberland, Gloucester and Salem counties and serves as deputy speaker, discussed the proposed fiscal year 2013 budget during a March 28 NJTV appearance. He said that "the use of one-shot monies, which means monies found that are only going to be available one time, are exceeding $600 million dollars in this budget and last year they were $96 million. "And that's a very dramatic change. So that tells you that the structural work that we're trying to do to keep the budget in balance is still struggling. And when you take advantage of income that is only coming one time the next year you have to find a way to replace that or you have to take other drastic steps," Burzichelli said, adding "that the use of that, what is called one-shots, is a 500 percent increase over the last Corzine budget." New Jersey Treasury Department documents show the state used $3.82 billion in one-shots in fiscal year 2010, the last budget former Gov. Jon Corzine signed. Christie’s 2013 budget proposal includes $1.64 billion in such revenues. That’s a decrease, not a 500 percent increase, as Burzichelli claims. So what gives? Let’s say a family spent less on groceries this year than last year, but spent more on cereal over the same time frame. Overall, the family spent less, even though they spent more on a particular type of food. That’s essentially how Burzichelli makes his claim. In total, Christie is using fewer one-shots than Corzine. But Christie’s reliance on a specific type of one-shots has increased. Christie is proposing to use $642.3 million in a type of one-shots called revenue-related initiatives, which includes transfers from funds dedicated for specific purposes, such as clean energy. That’s an increase of more than 490 percent from the $108.8 million used in fiscal 2010. In the current budget, Christie relied on $96.4 million in similar revenues. Burzichelli cites some of those figures in the television interview, but he doesn’t explain what they represent. A spokesman for the Assembly Democrats, Tom Hester, said Burzichelli was referring specifically to revenue-related initiatives. "It’s that simple. You can read it any way you want, but doing [so] ignores the irresponsible impact of these budget raids," he said. But by focusing only on some one-shots, Burzichelli ignores a larger context. In total, Corzine’s last spending plan relied on $3.82 billion in one-time revenue resources. In Christie’s proposal, one-time revenue totals $1.64 billion. Federal stimulus aid inflated the total use of one-time revenues in 2010. But John Sugden, a credit analyst with Standard & Poor’s who wrote a report in February critical of Christie’s proposed budget, said the federal aid is still a source of revenue that will have to be replaced the following fiscal year. Sugden said in an e-mail that "the use of non-recurring revenues (one-shots) to fund recurring expenditures, in our view, creates budgetary gaps or shortfalls in the following year regardless of what their source is." Our ruling Burzichelli said the reliance on one-time revenues in the governor’s proposed budget is a "500 percent increase over the last Corzine budget." That’s roughly correct for a particular type of one-shots that includes money diverted from dedicated funds. But the assemblyman doesn’t make that clear and the state relies on hundreds of millions of dollars in other one-time revenue-generating measures. And, in total, Christie is using less one-time revenue than Corzine. Burzichelli’s claim has a hint of truth but cherry-picks statistics and ignores critical context. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-09350	"Teachers will not be able to return to work after raising their children."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/apr/06/paula-dockery/dockery-says-sb-6-would-not-allow-teachers-return-/	One of the most contentious issues of the 2010 legislative session is a plan to overhaul teacher pay and tenure. Teachers statewide overwhelmingly oppose the legislation, known as SB 6, which has been buoyed by Republican leaders. Sen. Paula Dockery, a candidate for governor, was one of a few Republicans to vote against SB 6 when it passed the Senate last month. The House plans a vote soon. Dockery followed up her vote by writing an opinion column that ran in the Lakeland Ledger on April 3, 2010, and contained some explosive charges about what's wrong with the bill. Here's an excerpt: "SB 6 will destroy jobs. The bill makes it nearly impossible for someone not currently teaching to renew his or her teaching certificate. Teachers will not be able to return to work after raising their children. They will have their certifications threatened if they are activated for military duty, or otherwise unavailable to teach, for longer than one school year." (Read the whole column here.) It's a strong statement with broad implications. We chose to focus on the claim that "teachers will not be able to return to work after raising their children." Could that be true? First, some basics about SB 6. Among other things, the bill would make it easier to fire teachers and base their pay on test scores rather than the current schedule based on years of service and degrees. Supporters say it would reward high-performing teachers and make it easier to get rid of underperforming teachers, while detractors say it will deter teachers from the profession. Teachers hired on or after July 1, 2010, would be placed on a one-year probationary contract during which time they could be fired and then later would be placed on subsequent contracts. Teachers hired before July 1, 2010, keep their jobs as long as they can show "effective performance" in four of the five years leading up to renewal. We contacted Dockery's campaign and Senate office to ask how she reached the conclusion that parents who leave their teaching jobs for some length of time could not later return to work. Her Senate spokeswoman, Rachel Perrin Rogers, referred us to a portion of SB 6 that states: "Beginning with the 2014-2015 school year, the requirements for the renewal of a professional certificate shall include documentation of effective or highly effective performance as demonstrated under s. 1012.34 for at least 4 of the preceding 5 years before the renewal certification is sought." "This is saying you can't renew your certificate if you haven't done what is outlined in this chapter," Rogers said. "How can I renew it if I have taken time off?" But in the same section of the bill Rogers pointed us to, we found this: "The State Board of Education shall adopt rules to define the process for documenting effective performance under this subsection, including equivalent options for individuals who have not been evaluated under s. 1012.34," which relates to evaluating teachers. That part indicates there is an exception -- although not clearly spelled out -- for teachers who don't get evaluated because they are on leave. Thomas Butler, spokesman for the state Department of Education, explained it this way: "As currently written, the bill states that the State Board would have to adopt rules to define the process for documenting effective performance to meet renewal requirements, including for individuals who are not evaluated under 1012.34. As such, individuals who are on leave from the district and who would not have such an evaluation and, therefore, would be included in the rule." So the state Board of Education would develop the rule with public input after the bill becomes law. We asked Butler to clarify how the law would apply to a mother who takes time off from teaching to raise children. "When a mom takes time off she obviously won't be receiving evaluations," Butler told PolitiFact Florida. "She is not going to have evaluations so it's implied she will fall under the state board rule that hasn't been developed." Kathy Hebda, deputy chancellor for educator quality at the Department of Education, will oversee the rule writing. Hebda said the bill says the state board "shall" write the rule -- so it will definitely happen. "It's actually requiring the state board to adopt a rule to include an equivalent option for individuals who didn't get evaluated," she said. "There are going to be a lot of people in that scenario including persons who decide to leave the classroom for a couple of years and come back. The state board is going to have to have a process to bring that person back in and let them renew the certificate." That could include teachers who had worked at private schools or out of state, she said. Roberto Martinez, a member of the state board that will develop the rules, said he had not heard anything about this particular issue. However he said that if a rule needs to be written to address parents who want to return to teaching, that will be done. "I'm not about to penalize a mom. ... I would encourage women to work and raise a family." Critics of the bill say the language is not clear in terms of the effect on teachers who take leaves. State Rep. Marty Kiar, D-Davie, who has introduced amendments related to the bill, said in an interview that the issue of the effect on teachers who take leaves has not yet arisen in committee meetings. "I'm going to ask the questions on the floor tomorrow to the bill sponsor," he said on April 6. So, let's review. SB 6 clearly states that teachers must show "effective or highly effective" performance for four of the five preceeding years -- which clearly can't be done for teachers who want to return from a few years' leave. But the bill also directs the state Board of Education to adopt rules to document effective performance for teachers not evaluated. The state Department of Education says that clause means the state board will create a rule that will apply to teachers who have taken leave to take care of their children for example -- although SB 6 doesn't clearly spell out that scenario. Dockery said "teachers will not be able to return to work after raising their children." We find there is a provision in SB 6 to prevent this scenario, but because the rules won't be written until after the bill becomes law, we can't definitely say what will happen. We rule Dockery's claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03423	The immigration bill includes free "Obamacars," motorcycles or scooters.	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2013/jun/26/blog-posting/does-immigration-bill-include-free-obamacars-teens/	As chief defender on the right of the Senate immigration bill, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has been churning out press releases debunking myths about the bill. "Remember the ‘Marcophone’ myth? Now we have the Obamacar myth," says a June 25 Rubio press release. Yep, you read that right: Rubio, a potential 2016 Republican presidential contender, issued a press release claiming that a conservative slam against the Democratic president is a myth. Rubio’s press release linked to a June 24 article on the conservative news site Breitbart with the headline "New Immigration bill has taxpayer subsidized Obamacars for youths." It featured a photo of a goofy-looking Obama climbing into a car. "Breitbart News has learned there is a provision included in the immigration bill that could be used to give free cars, motorcycles, scooters or other vehicles to young people around the country over a period of 15 months after the bill passes," the story said. "The new provision is a result of the latest addition to the Corker-Hoeven amendment, which is essentially an entirely new version of the bill." The claim was made multiple times on the Internet, including on Fox News on June 25. The commentators joked about the alleged car giveaway with contributor Laura Ingraham asking, "I want to know, are Segway scooters part of the deal?’ " PolitiFact previously examined a claim by bloggers that proposed immigration legislation would give away taxpayer-funded cell phones. We ruled that claim False. That referred to grants aimed at helping American ranchers and others in remote locations along the border get satellite phone service so they can be in touch with authorities. Are free "Obamacars" another rumor driven off track? The roots of the car rumor The Breitbart article related to an amendment filed in June by Sens. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., and John Hoeven, R-N.D., to the Senate immigration bill. Their amendment would double the number of border patrol agents to 20,000, complete 700 miles of fencing, and add E-Verify for employment, among other requirements. Another amendment by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was tacked on to the Corker-Hoeven amendment, and passed on a procedural vote, 67-27, on June 24. The Breitbart article credited another conservative publication, the Washington Examiner, for uncovering "the new Obama stimulus program" that was part of the Sanders amendment. The Examiner article stated that a version of the bill would provide $1.5 billion for jobs for American youth, and was a sweetener to get Sanders’ support. Sanders' intention was to help unemployed young people hit hard by the recession. In a June 21 press release, his office said it was "the least Congress should do in a bill that allows college students from around the world to take jobs that young Americans would otherwise perform." The Breitbart article relied on an anonymous GOP Senate aide to explain the amendment:"This appears to give states authority to buy, lease or rent motorcycles, cars and scooters or anything kids want to buy to get to and from a job," the GOP aide said. But the Examiner article and the Sanders press release didn’t mention cars, motorcycles, scooters -- heck, not even a tricycle. So we hit the virtual road in search of some sort of transportation connection. Sanders amendment would provide transportation ‘services’ A fact sheet about the amendment by Sanders stated that the money for the jobs program would include providing "important services such as transportation and child care, necessary to enable young Americans to participate in job opportunities." Neither the fact sheet nor the amendment defines transportation services. Rubio’s press release states that transportation services "means the program could provide a service, like a bus ride to a work site, but it cannot provide a car, scooter, motorcycle, or pair of rollerblades." Rubio spokesman Alex Conant told PolitiFact in an email that "...the key word in the legislation is ‘service.’ That qualifier means that they will be provided ‘services’ and not ‘goods’ as in ‘goods and services’ (a common term when referring to tangibles and intangibles). In practice, it means the program can gives kids a bus pass – but it’s not giving them a car." Breitbart published a new post in response to Rubio saying his "narrow reading of the bill is unlikely to be applied by the federal government." We asked Warren Gunnels, senior policy adviser to Sanders, who would decide what could qualify as a transportation service. If the law passed, the U.S. Labor Department would have 20 days to create regulations for the jobs program and states would have 30 days to respond. Gunnels said that local workforce boards would come up with proposals that would be vetted by states and then submitted to the Labor Department, which would have the final say. So to believe the Obamacar claim would mean, for example, that a workforce board in Miami would suggest that it would give away free cars or motorcycles, Republican Gov. Rick Scott’s administrators would give that the thumbs up, and the Labor Department would declare that engines go. To be fair, it’s not expressly spelled out in the amendment that car/scooter/rollerblade giveaways are a no-no and that bus passes are a cheaper idea, but there is also no proof that the government would give away vehicles. The transportation and childcare services language is similar to Obama’s American Jobs Act presented to Congress in 2011, which never became law. Sanders provided PolitiFact a response via his spokesman: "This amendment addresses a crisis in youth unemployment in this country. The unemployment rate for 16- to 19-year-olds is 24.5 percent and higher for Hispanics and African-Americans. What my amendment says, which is obvious, is that providing a job for a young person is meaningless if they don’t have transportation to be able to get to that job. So the program has the option of providing funding for bus fare or subway tickets or other means of transportation. It is only the wild imagination that we have come to expect from Fox TV that would come up with this preposterous idea that we are buying automobiles for young people." Our ruling An amendment by Sanders to the immigration bill would provide a youth jobs program that includes the possibility of transportation and child care services. That prompted conservative news outlets to make claims such as, "New Immigration bill has taxpayer subsidized Obamacars for youths." Sanders’ amendment doesn’t define in detail what the transportation services would entail. Ultimately if the bill passes, local workforce boards would propose jobs programs that would be signed off by the states and approved by the U.S. Labor Department. There is no proof to support the idea that the program would include free car, motorcycle or scooter giveaways. In fact, that such a process would end up allowing car giveaways seems laughable.

pomt-09551	"Federal employees are making twice as much as their private counterparts."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/03/scott-brown/politifact-debut-brown-says-federal-jobs-pay-twice/	Only 12 days after his upset victory in Massachusetts, Republican Sen.-elect Scott Brown made his debut on the Sunday morning talk circuit. He talked about health care, the war in Afghanistan and deficit reduction in an interview with Barbara Walters on the Jan. 31, 2010 episode of This Week. Brown encouraged President Barack Obama to put a freeze on federal position hires and raises because, "as you know, federal employees are making twice as much as their private counterparts." Federal jobs don't exactly have a reputation for bringing in big bucks, so we were curious about Brown's claim. Before we get into his statement, it's useful to understand how the government sets salaries. Trade, craft and laboring workers are paid according to the Federal Wage System, which pegs pay to local prevailing rates. Salaries for white-collar employees are set under a separate pay system that determines salaries by comparing government positions to similar jobs in the private sector. Increasingly, some agencies and departments are using pay schemes that are more closely tied to performance rather than tenure, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and these workers are generally paid more. It turns out that Brown has talked about federal employee pay before. On Jan. 4, before he was elected, Brown called for a temporary pay freeze for federal workers. "I recognize that our federal workers do important work, but it’s not right that lesser-paid private sector workers suffering through a recession have to pay for expensive government salaries,” he said, citing numbers from the Cato Institute, a libertarian think-tank. In August 2009, Cato published an analysis of wage statistics from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a branch of the U.S. Commerce Department. According to those numbers, the average wage for 1.9 million federal civilian workers was $79,197, compared to $50,028 for the nation’s 108 million private-sector workers. (The analysis leaves out combat military personnel on the theory that there aren't equivalent jobs in the private sector.) Chris Edwards, the director of tax policy studies at Cato who wrote the analysis, later said it generated some controversy. Some critics said that the federal work force is generally more skilled than, say, people who work in the service industry. So naturally, the average would be higher. (Edwards acknowledged that was "an important factor to consider," but said the increase in federal wages has much steeper than the private sector. "Has the composition of the federal work force really changed that much in just eight years to justify such a big relative gain? I doubt it.") Secondly, some critics argued that an average is not especially useful when comparing private and public-sector salaries. John Palguta, vice president of public policy for the Partnership for Public Service, a group that urges people to work in government, told us that a more useful comparison is to look at specific jobs in the public and private sectors and see how they compare. For example, he said, federal doctors and nurses typically do not make as much as they could in private jobs. We checked a variety of sources for apples-to-apples comparisons and found a variety of results. One study came from the Federal Salary Council, an advisory group of labor relations experts and representatives of federal employee unions that helps the U.S. Office of Personnel Management set wage rates. It found that for comparable private and public jobs such as lawyers, public sector employees are paid on average 26 percent less than private sector counterparts. When we checked individual jobs using the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics employment data (from 2008), we found many federal salaries were indeed higher, but some were lower. Higher: A government-employed nurse makes about $74,460 on average, while someone in the same position working for the private sector makes about $65,130. A cashier working for the government makes on average $34,470 while a cashier working in a store only makes a mean of $18,880 annually. And a public-relations manager working for the government makes about $132,410 a year compared to $101,220 in the private sector. Lower: Petroleum engineers working for the government earn an average of $93,140; in the private sector, they make an average of $119,140. An editor working for the government only makes $42,210, compared to an average of $57,180 in the private sector. It's worth noting that the BLS's overall average for federal jobs is $68,740 compared to the private sector average of $42,270, so it reflects the Cato Institute findings. That brings us back to Brown's original statement, that federal employees make twice as much "as their private counterparts." First, even if you look at the average overall, he's exaggerating the difference. The numbers he cites from the Cato study are not twice as high. Secondly, it's important to understand that a big reason for the disparity is the different mix of jobs in the federal work force. It has more higher-paying white-collar jobs, experts told us, while there are more lower-paying, blue-collar jobs in the private sector that bring the average down. So it is not an apples-to-apples comparison. Finally, we found it's a mixed bag when comparing individual private and public sector occupations -- the "private counterparts" he spoke of. Some public jobs pay more, some pay less. And the public ones that pay more are not consistently double as he claimed. So he's wrong to say it's double and wrong to suggest that it's always the case when comparing specific jobs. We rate his claim False.

pomt-06858	"#Business formation is still on the rise in Ohio! So far in 2011 we’ve assisted w/ 44,443 new business filings."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/aug/03/jon-husted/ohio-secretary-state-jon-husted-touts-rise-new-bus/	Ohio politicians have made job creation a top priority and talking point. Gov. John Kasich, for instance, runs nearly every policy proposal through the jobs filter and frequently cites his belief that the state must be more business friendly to spur job growth. Even Secretary of State Jon Husted wants the public to know that he is keeping a close eye on jobs, an issue that he and fellow Republicans successfully harnessed during the 2010 election, when they knocked Democrats from office in part by blaming them for the state’s job woes. Though Husted’s most visible duty is overseeing elections, he is responsible for keeping track of the paperwork filed by individuals and companies – both non profit and for-profit corporations -- that want to do business in Ohio. On July 18, 2011, a tweet by his office’s Twitter account, @OhioSOSHusted, noted that his office has processed more requests to set up companies through June of this year than the office processed during same period last year. "#Business formation is still on the rise in Ohio! So far in 2011 we’ve assisted w/ 44,443 new business filings." The tweet also included a link to a news release his office posted to the Internet. PolitiFact Ohio was intrigued by the tweet and specifically whether the increase in business filings is an indicator of an upswing in business as the message -- and its exclamation point -- suggests. The state handled 41,891 business filings through June 2010. That means the state processed 2,552 more business filings through the first six months of this year – or about 6 percent -- compared to last year, according to Husted’s office. "The number of new business selecting Ohio as a place to do business is heading in the right direction," Husted said in the news release. To get a better perspective on business filings, PolitiFact Ohio asked Matt McClellan from Husted’s office for the six-month and yearly totals of business filings dating back to at January 2005, nearly three years before the recession officially began in December 2007. McClellan offered these additional figures: 2005 (January through June) 42,919; (total for the year) 78,025 2006 (January through June) 41,664; (total for the year) 79,653 2007 (January through June) 41,401; (total for year) 77,582 2008 (January through June) 41,145; (total for year) 77,858 2009 (January through June) 39,691; (total for the year) 75,854 2010 (January through June) 41,891; (total for the year) 80,081 Broadly speaking, these figures show the total number of filings has bobbed up and down and currently trending upward slightly. Narrowing the focus, the January-through-June average total filings for the years leading up to the start of the recession is 41,994; the January-through-June average total filings during the recession is 40,909, or about a 2.5 percent fewer. So how does that compare to the 2011 January-through-June figure that inspired the tweet? It is nearly even with the pre-recession yearly six-month average; and slighlty ahead of the recession average. While the filings figures offer trend line, they tell us very little about the nature of the businesses, leaving to speculation whether they represent signs of real new businesses, future businesses, or just paperwork signaling legal and tax changes. Also, it’s impossible to calculate the number of new businesses without knowing what is happening to existing businesses. If, for instance, new filings increased by 5,000 but 6,000 businesses failed, the uptick in filings, by itself, would create a misleading sign of growth. Husted seems to acknowledge that these numbers provide an incomplete view, but he still sees these as a positive sign. "While recognizing these number can’t provide a complete picture of Ohio’s job climate, they are an important indicator of economic activity that Secretary Husted hopes will add to the discussion of how to improve the state’s overall climate for business," Husted’s news release states. It’s hard to ignore, however, a caveat at the bottom of Husted’s press release: "Filing as a business in Ohio does not guarantee the company will begin operations, be profitable or create jobs." So where does Husted’s tweet land on the Truth-0-Meter? The figure in of itself is correct and points to a slight post-recession upward trend. But the context around the tweet – the figure is worth boasting about because it’s a sign of economy recovery – seems overly optimistic, especially given the news release’s footnote that there’s no guarantee these filings mean more jobs will be created. Husted’s claim is accurate, but leaves out details that provide clarification. PolitiFact rates this claim Mostly True.	None	Jon Husted	None	None	None	2011-08-03T06:00:00	2011-07-18	['Ohio']

"NFL lawyer, who claimed Super Bowl is ‘rigged,’ found dead," stated the Feb. 1 headline on Eco News, a website that claims it is on the frontline for "earth liberation." Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The story copies an earlier fake story by YourNewsWire, a website that publishes fake news. We sent messages to both websites and didn’t get a reply. We found no evidence that an NFL lawyer named Dan Goodes even exists, or that he was found dead in his BMW in Manhattan. NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy told PolitiFact that the NFL has no attorney named Dan Goodes. He called the story "ridiculous," "bogus" and "fake." The story said that Goodes had been representing the NFL in Minneapolis to promote the 2018 Super Bowl featuring the Philadelphia Eagles and New England Patriots when he went off script and claimed that the NFL rigged the game to earn maximum revenue for league. "According to Goodes, the fat cat franchise owners and their pampered players do not care who wins, as long as they continue reaping the lucrative financial benefits provided by the system," the article said. The article included a mock screenshot of a Jan. 28 New York Times article about the alleged shooting of the lawyer founded slumped over the wheel of his BMW. But the article doesn’t appear in Nexis. "Nothing about this is real, down to the URL," New York Times spokeswoman Eileen Murphy told PolitiFact. "It's a false reference to a non-existent NYT story." The Eco News story included a photo of two police officers at a crime scene. We searched Google images and found it matched an Associated Press photo of a crime scene near the site where a police officer was fatally shot in the Bronx in July. It also contained an alleged photo of NFL headquarters; however, a search of that photo in Google images resulted in a match to a picture on the South Park Studios website. Other conspiracy theories about Super Bowl rigging Readers should beware of other conspiracy theories about the Super Bowl. The Facebook page Satire Daily, which clearly identifies itself as satire, published a video seemingly documenting that the NFL had openly admitted to rigging games. Snopes debunked the claim in January. The video focused on a referee who congratulated the team’s quarterback Tom Brady after the Patriots beat the Jaguars. That actually happened. Referee Clete Blakeman did Brady a congratulatory pat on the chest, which fueled some conspiracy theories. NFL spokesman McCarthy told PolitiFact, "It's not uncommon for an official to congratulate a player after a game." Another situation that fueled conspiracy theories stemmed from an actual NFL ad on social media in January before the NFC Championship Game. The ad featured photos of the Patriots and Vikings quarterbacks and said, "When you donate to United Way, you could score 2 club-level seats to watch the Patriots vs. the Vikings battle it out for the coveted Super Bowl title!" The NFL apologized for the ads. "It was a regrettable mistake," an unnamed NFL spokesman told media. "The ads were mocked up using all the (possible) combinations, but weren’t supposed to go until Monday when the matchup is known. Obviously, someone jumped the gun." McCarthy also told PolitiFact the ad was a mistake. Our ruling In the world of real news, PolitiFact has fact-checked many claims related to past Super Bowls related to weather, records and spending as well as human trafficking and domestic violence and economic impact. But in this case, the claim that an "NFL lawyer, who claimed Super Bowl is ‘rigged’, found dead" is fake news. We rate this story Pants on Fire!

pomt-09447	George W. Bush was "the least popular president in modern history."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/08/dana-milbank/milbank-says-bush-was-least-popular-president-mode/	It's become an article of faith for many Democrats that the presidency of George W. Bush was a failure. That kind of opinion is beyond the scope of the Truth-O-Meter, but we do feel comfortable assessing something more concrete: measuring how Bush fared in public opinion polls. In a March 7, 2010, opinion column, the Washington Post's Dana Milbank took a critical -- and in some cases, rather harsh -- look at the new memoir by Karl Rove called Courage and Consequence: My Life as a Conservative in the Fight. In his column, Milbank writes that before the former Bush adviser published his book, he had "2 1/2 years to reflect on what turned Bush into the least popular president in modern history." We thought it worth checking whether Milbank was correct that George W. Bush was "the least popular president in modern history." We will start by raising a caveat. Milbank's exact words were that Bush was "the least popular president in modern history." There's no direct scientific measurement of popularity, but the polling industry offers two barometers that come close: presidential approval ratings and presidential favorability. Approval ratings are based on how well poll respondents rate the job someone is doing as president ("Do you approve or disapprove of the job the president is doing?"). By contrast, favorability questions are more broad. They usually ask whether the respondent feels favorably or unfavorably toward the president. (Pollsters call the two numbers the "fave/unfave"). Favorability is not strictly about someone's job performance, though that certainly plays a role in most people's assessments; rather, it's about how they feel generally toward the person. The differences between these two measures are not trivial. President Bill Clinton famously recorded strong job-approval ratings even as his personal popularity sagged during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. The opposite seems to be happening with President Barack Obama, who has maintained relatively robust favorability rankings even as his job approval numbers have sunk. However you decide this question, most polling experts agree that Gallup offers the best source material to test Milbank's claim, since it offers both the longest-running data set (going as far back as Harry Truman for approval rating) and the most consistent wording. One drawback: Gallup only began asking regular favorability questions in 1992, the final year of George H.W. Bush's presidency. The company continued through the presidencies of Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama. Here's how Bush stacked up: Measured on favorability, Bush did indeed record the lowest numbers of the four presidents studied. His father George H.W. Bush never fell below 38 percent favorability, Clinton never fell below 42 percent, and Obama has not yet fallen below 55 percent. But George W. Bush recorded a low of 32 percent. That bolsters Milbank's point, but it's a narrow field. It only compares Bush against the full term of one other president -- Clinton -- and brief portions of two others. And besides, it's hard to argue that the "modern" presidential era, to use Milbank's term, began in 1992. Polling experts told us job approval is a better measure. That allows us to compare Bush against nine of his predecessors and Obama. But there are several ways to slice the data: • Average job-approval rating. On this one, George W. Bush ranks in the bottom half of the table, but well above the bottom. With an average job-approval rating of 49.4 percent, Bush ranked below John F. Kennedy (70.1 percent), Dwight Eisenhower (65.0), George H.W. Bush (60.9), Lyndon Johnson and Bill Clinton (tied at 55.1) and Ronald Reagan (52.8). But Bush ranked ahead of Richard Nixon (49.0), Gerald Ford (47.2), Jimmy Carter (45.5) and Truman (45.4). (We're not counting Obama in this category because of his short tenure.) So by this measure, Bush was not the least popular modern president. • Final job approval rating. Measured by final job-approval rating just before they left office, Bush ranks low, but -- once again -- not the lowest in the "modern era." He ranks behind Clinton (66 percent), Reagan (63), Eisenhower (59), Kennedy (58), George H.W. Bush (56), Ford (53) and Johnson (49). But Bush is tied with Carter at 34 percent, and ranks ahead of Truman at 32 percent and Nixon at 24 percent. (Here too, we won't count Obama because he's in the midst of his term.) By this measure, too, Bush was not the least popular modern president. • Lowest job approval rating at any point. By this measure, Bush -- who bottomed out at 25 percent approval -- comes close to ranking the lowest. His worst rating is lower than those of nine presidents (including Obama) and is narrowly ahead of two others. In descending order, the low scores run from a high of 56 percent (Kennedy), through Eisenhower (48), Obama (47), Ford and Clinton (37 each), Johnson (35), Reagan (35), George H.W. Bush (29) and Carter (28). Bush's score ranked slightly ahead of Nixon at 24 percent and Truman at 22 percent. We asked Gallup spokesman Eric Nielsen whether there was any practical difference between Bush's 25 percent, Nixon's 24 percent and Truman's 22 percent. He noted that most of these polls have an error margin of plus or minus 3 percent, which suggested to him that these three low scores are close enough to be statistically tied. So even though Bush's worst number isn't technically the lowest of the bunch, it's close enough that we can't say for sure that it's not the lowest. • Highest presidential disapproval ratings. Gallup doesn't post a summary of highest disapproval ratings on its Web site, but Charles Franklin, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin (Madison) and co-founder of the Web site Pollster.com, told PolitiFact that only four presidents have registered disapproval ratings north of 60 percent. George H.W. Bush peaked at 60 percent disapproval in Gallup's polls. Nixon peaked at 66 percent. Truman peaked at 67 percent. And George W. Bush peaked at ... 71 percent -- easily the highest on record. So measured by highest disapproval ratings, Milbank would be right. The results, then, are a mixed bag. We can't use the favorability rating because it only goes back to 1992. As for job approval, two of the three measures show that Bush was definitely not the least popular president. In the third, it was a statistical tie for the bottom spot. The only way Bush is the clearly the least popular is when measured by disapproval ratings. So we rate Milbank's claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-14423	"If you look at Latino kids between 17 and 20 who graduated high school, 36 percent of them are unemployed or underemployed. … African-American kids are unemployed or underemployed to the tune of 51 percent."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/10/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-statistic-black-hispanic-unemployme/	During the Univision-Washington Post Democratic presidential debate in Miami, Bernie Sanders highlighted the bleak economic prospects of minority youths. "One of the points that I've been making, and media does not seem to pick up on it, is that we have a real crisis not only with real unemployment in America being close to 10 percent, but youth unemployment in this country," Sanders said. "If you look at Latino kids between 17 and 20 who graduated high school, 36 percent of them are unemployed or underemployed. … African-American kids are unemployed or underemployed to the tune of 51 percent." We checked a nearly identical statement by Sanders back in July 2015, when Sanders mentioned it at a campaign event in Portland, Maine. We rated it Mostly True. Now, eight months later, we’ll revisit it. We’ll start by noting that the most commonly used unemployment-rate statistic is not as high for each group as Sanders indicated. The most readily available data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics covers the age range from 16 to 19, which isn’t identical but gives a quick approximation. For whites in that age range, the official unemployment rate in February 2016 was 13.9 percent, for Hispanics it was 15.6 percent and for African-Americans it was 23.3 percent. In other words, the official unemployment rate shows that African-American youth unemployment is significantly higher than white youth unemployment and, to a lesser extent, higher than Hispanic youth unemployment. Still, the levels for each group are lower than what Sanders said. So what’s going on? Sanders’ camp pointed us to research published in June 2015 by the Economic Policy Institute, a left-of-center think tank. The numbers in the report match what Sanders said at the debate. This data is different from the more familiar measurements for a few reasons. One, the institute didn’t just look at employment status for people between the ages of 17 and 20; it limited its reach to high school graduates who were not enrolled in further schooling. And two, EPI counted not only unemployed workers but also those who were working part-time due to the weakness of the economy and those who were "marginally attached to the labor force." The latter category includes people who did not meet the strict definition of being in the job market, but weren’t entirely out of the market, either. The statistic EPI used, known by the wonky shorthand U-6, is officially called a measure of "labor underutilization" rather than "unemployment." EPI itself used the term "underemployment" in its research. At the Miami debate, Sanders described this statistic accurately, referring to individuals who are "unemployed or underemployed." So his statement has merit. However, the data is getting a little stale, and since the employment picture has generally been improving since the middle of last year, that’s a potential problem for the accuracy of Sanders’ statement. The last month analyzed in the EPI study was March 2015. We don’t know exactly how much improvement there’s been for young, minority, high school graduates since then, because that specific slice of the data isn’t readily available on the Bureau of Labor Statistics website. But we can do a quick estimate based on the change in unemployment rates for 16-to-19-year-old Hispanics and African-Americans between March 2015 and February 2016. During that period -- since the EPI report came out -- the unemployment rate for young Hispanics fell from 20.9 percent to 15.6 percent, and for young African-Americans, it fell from 25.1 percent to 23.3 percent. In other words, it’s quite possible that the unemployment rates for young, minority, high-school grads is lower now than what Sanders stated. We should caution that the unemployment rate for subsets of the population, such as minority groups, tends to be volatile and has a larger margin of error than for the population as a whole. Still, the unemployment rates for these groups do seem to be lower in more recent months. During 2015, the black youth unemployment rate often reached or exceeded 30 percent, making the current rate of 23.3 percent particularly low -- the lowest since 2000, in fact. Similarly, in 2015, the Hispanic youth unemployment rate often reached or exceeded 20 percent, a level well above the current 15.6 percent rate. Our ruling Sanders said that "if you look at Latino kids between 17 and 20 who graduated high school, 36 percent of them are unemployed or underemployed. … African-American kids are unemployed or underemployed to the tune of 51 percent." As was the case when we first reviewed this claim last July, Sanders’ general point is correct -- that in an apples-to-apples comparison, African-American and Hispanic youth have significantly worse prospects in the job market than whites do. But while Sanders had support for this data when he first began using these numbers eight months ago, there’s reason to believe that the improving job market has lowered these rates, at least somewhat. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2016-03-10T00:27:48	2016-03-09	['None']
pomt-07404	"Texans spend $2.5 billion gambling in our neighboring states every year."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/apr/29/texans-economic-development/pro-gambling-group-says-texans-annually-gamble-25-/	An online banner ad on the Austin American-Statesman’s website April 19 made us eager to try our luck. "Thank you Texas," says a color postcard featuring slot machines and addressed to the state of Texas. The ad, sponsored by a group that seeks to legalize slot machines in Texas, features three messages -- New Mexico thanking Texas for "your" $27 million and Louisiana and Oklahoma each offering thanks for "your" $1 billion. Text below the postcards states: "Texans spend $2.5 billion gambling in our neighboring states every year." That’s a lot of quarters. Is it right? We asked Texans for Economic Development, the ad’s sponsor, for elaboration. The group, consisting of horse racing interests, wants Texas lawmakers to ask voters to permit slot machines at 13 in-state horse and greyhound tracks and three Indian reservations. Its spokesman, Mike Lavigne, passed along a July 7, 2010, report prepared for the group by TXP, an Austin economic policy consulting group, stating that in 2009, Texans spent $2.7 billion on gaming and related activities in nearby states. The report says Texans gambled most of that -- $2.57 billion -- immediate neighbors-with-casinos: Oklahoma, where the report says Texans threw down nearly $1.2 billion; Louisiana, about $1.1 billion; and New Mexico, $27 million. The state-by-state figures were based on various sources "including state gaming commissions, primary field research, convention and visitors bureaus ... and other academic studies," the report says. We wondered where those figures originated. Casinos would be ideal sources for how much Texans plunk down across state lines, but we found no evidence they talk about their customer base. Hence, Alan Meister, who analyzes gaming issues for an Arlington, Va., consulting firm, advised us that certain "assumptions have to be made" to estimate the dollars gambled by residents of various states. In an interview, Jon Hockenyos,TXP’s president, explained that the firm had to mesh different data "to get the right order of magnitude" for how much Texans were gambling. "It’s like making fruit salad," he said. The firm’s recipe, according to Hockenyos: --In Oklahoma, researchers counted Texas license plates at a range of tribal gambling venues, finding Texas plates accounted for 90 percent of the vehicles in a sampling from halls close to Texas; 47 percent of plates at a sampling of casinos farther away; and 6 percent of establishments farthest from Texas. Using the number of slot machines at each hall, TXP concluded that Texans accounted for 37 percent of the casinos’ total reported gaming revenue in 2009, which TXP estimated at $3.2 billion based on a national Indian gaming report. Hockenyos also noted a March 9 news article in The Tulsa World, quoting a study by Meister, that said tribal gaming revenue in Oklahoma for 2009 was $3.1 billion. The estimated piece of the Oklahoma gambling action credited to Texans: $1.18 billion. --For Louisiana, TXP zeroed in on a 2009-10 report by the state on the economic impact of Louisiana’s riverboat casino industry. It said 62 percent of the casinos’ visitors came from another state or more than 150 miles away. TXP, mindful that Texans accounted for 70 percent of the combined 2008 populations of Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi, extrapolated from those percentages to estimate the Texans’ share of the far-away visitors -- 43 percent -- and multiplied that percentage by the state-reported 2009 gambling revenue, about $2.5 billion. Wade Duty, executive director of the Louisiana Casino Association, forwarded what he described as a yet-to-be published January survey result indicating that 49 percent of riverboat casino customers hail from other states or more than 150 miles away. Informed of the lower figure, Texans for Economic Development reduced its estimate of the money Texans gamble in Louisiana from $1.1 billion to $869 million. Duty said he’s not sure about the assumption that Texans comprised 70 percent of those out-of-state and long-distance gamblers. The Harvey Canal, site of a New Orleans riverboat casino, may be beautiful, he said, but "people aren’t spending 16 hours in a car to come from Midland." Duty called TXP’s revised estimate for how much Texans’ gambled "more reasonable," but said: "I can’t say it’s correct." Duty said a better way of estimating Texans’ expenditures would start with interviews of gambling patrons to gauge where they came from, how long they’d stayed and what they’d gambled. --For New Mexico, TXP concluded that Texans over all accounted for about 8 percent of the money gambled in casinos and racinos, which are race tracks with slot machines. Hockenyos noted that nearly 4,000 slot machines -- a little less than one third of all the slot machines in the state -- are in southern New Mexico, near El Paso. El Paso’s population accounts for more than 65 percent of the residents of that southern sector, Hockenyos said, and Texans account for more than 20 percent of New Mexico’s annual visitors. TXP applied the Texans’ 8 percent to what it then believed to be relevant gaming spending of nearly $350 million, making the Texans’ share $27 million. However, Hockenyos said, he later realized he’d inappropriately folded in licensing fees and also under-counted the year’s gambling expenditures, which were $968 million, according to records posted online by the New Mexico Gaming Control Board. The revised Texans’ portion? About $77 million. So, with the firm’s latest tweaks, the three-state estimate is closer to $2.1 billion. Everyone aboard with that? Well, no. Stephen Reeves, a spokesman for the anti-gambling, Baptist-backed Christian Life Commission, said counting license plates is a poor way of gauging how much Texans spend in casinos. He followed up by email: "However, if doing so I would suggest that the frequency that a particular car shows up must be taken into account to determine how much money they are ‘spending.’" Our take: The fruit-salad methodology used by the consulting group was not perfect. Absent precise data, though, TXP’s estimate of how much money Texans gamble in neighboring states looks reasonable, though it’s a stretch to claim Texans gamble the same total amount every year. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Texans for Economic Development	None	None	None	2011-04-29T06:00:00	2011-04-19	['None']
pomt-07027	"You see a whole bunch of Korean cars here in the United States, and you don't see any American cars in Korea."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/04/barack-obama/barack-obama-said-you-dont-see-american-made-cars-/	President Barack Obama criticized Congress at a Wednesday press conference for not passing legislation that would help the economy. One example, he said, was that Congress needs to approve pending trade agreements. "I think these trade deals will be important because right now South Korea, frankly, has a better deal when it comes to our trading relationship than we do. Part of the reason I want to pass this trade deal is you see a whole bunch of Korean cars here in the United States, and you don't see any American cars in Korea. So let's re-balance that trading relationship. That's why we should get this passed," he said. We decided to fact-check Obama's statement about cars in the United States and Korea. Our first stop was to look at the statistics on auto imports and exports. We turned to numbers compiled by the U.S. Commerce Department. The numbers show that the United States exported 16,659 vehicles to Korea in 2010. Korea, meanwhile, exported 515,646 vehicles to the United States. That means that for every car we sent to Korea, the Koreans sent more than 30 to us. And we should note the 16,659 represented a six-year high; between 2005 and 2010 the number was even lower. It's true that South Korea has a smaller population than the United States, with about 48.8 million people there and 313.2 million people here. But that is an imbalance of about 1 to 6, significantly smaller than the disparity in auto sales. So Obama's larger point about a significant trade imbalance for cars is correct. Experts we spoke with also said he was largely correct that South Korea has "a better deal" when it comes to our trading relationship. Still, Obama's statement requires a few qualifications, they said. For one thing, there are not clear categories of American cars and Korean cars. Kia Motors, for example, has a large auto plant in Georgia, and Hyundai Motors has a plant in Alabama. It's possible that some of the cars the United States sold to Korea could be Korean-branded cars. Meanwhile, General Motors owns the Korean auto company Daewoo, which it purchased back in 2001. One estimate we saw said GM sold 90,000 Korean-made cars in Korea in 2008. This year, GM decided to end the Daewoo brand and operate as GM Korea. The Korean-made cars it now sells in the country carry typical American brands like Chevrolet. Additionally, the experts we spoke with presented a more nuanced picture of whether the trade agreement would actually help U.S. automakers sell more cars in Korea. Koreans tend to favor smaller, more fuel-efficient cars, and the government there maintains strict standards for fuel efficiency and other things that make it hard for American companies to compete, even if tariffs between the two countries are reduced. To look at it more optimistically, though, they said the proposed trade agreement would not make things worse for U.S. automakers. "I don't think we can get any worse," said Sean McAlinden, chief economist for the independent Center for Automotive Research. "The Koreans are doing all the damage they can do right now." Finally, we wanted to address the point of whether American made cars are rarely seen in Korea. David Straub, who leads the Korean Studies Program at Stanford University, lived in Seoul in 2007, so we asked him if he ever saw an American branded car while he was there. He said the statistics show that there are indeed some American cars are in South Korea. "But did I ever see an American car? I don't recall seeing one," he said. It's worth noting that Obama's press conference didn't do much to prod Congress to act on the trade agreement. The day after his remarks, Senate Republicans boycotted a hearing on the trade agreement, arguing that the trade agreement should not include $1 billion in additional spending to help workers who become unemployed as a result of international trade. Overall, though, we found little dispute that Obama's statement, "You see a whole bunch of Korean cars here in the United States, and you don't see any American cars in Korea," is largely correct, if you account for the complexity of international trade. Korean companies are building cars in America, while American companies build cars in Korea. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-03773	Says the president of the University of Texas has raised four-year student graduation rates to 75 percent.	false	/texas/statements/2013/apr/02/matt-mackowiak/matt-mackowiak-says-ut-president-has-raised-four-y/	Analyzing flashpoints of debate concerning the flagship University of Texas, Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak credited UT’s president with greatly driving up student graduation rates. Bill Powers, who has faced public questioning from members of the UT System Board of Regents, "has instituted reforms on his own," Mackowiak wrote in an opinion column published by the Austin American-Statesman on April 1, 2013. He added that UT System Chancellor Francisco Cigarroa had recently said Powers raised UT-Austin’s "four-year graduation rate from 53 percent to 75 percent." We were unaware of such a spike since Powers took over as president in 2006. After emailing Mackowiak about his conclusion, we turned to news stories on campus graduation rates as well as research cupboarded by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. According to a June 7, 2012, American-Statesman article, Powers set a goal in 2011 of at least 70 percent of the fall 2012 entering class earning a degree within four years. In contrast, UT's graduation rate had lately ranged from about 46 percent in 2000 to nearly 53 percent in 2005, the story said, with the 51 percent rate for the class of 2011 proving to be the highest among the state's 38 public universities for that year. A Feb. 12, 2013, Statesman news story said UT efforts to meet the goal "include stepped-up freshman orientation to reshape a campus culture that has long tolerated a more leisurely trajectory to graduation; the appointment of a senior vice provost to champion the four-year graduation cause; and the allotment of $5 million to encourage students to finish on time, with some of that money earmarked for financial aid to those making steady academic progress." Next, we asked the coordinating board for its calculation of UT-Austin’s four-year graduation rates. Spokesman Dominic Chavez emailed us a spreadsheet indicating the rate has ranged from 52 percent in fiscal 2007, which began Sept. 1, 2006, about seven months into Powers’ tenure, to 53 percent in fiscal 2012, the year ending Aug. 31, 2012. Chavez said each board calculation reflects the share of full-time students who enrolled in the fall of the year four years before, meaning the 2012 rate would sweep in students who had first enrolled in fall 2008 and graduated by the end of August 2012. Chavez said the reported rates may differ from other calculations because the board credits an institution where a student began his education even if the student has transferred and ultimately graduated elsewhere. We also asked UT-Austin about its four-year graduation rates. Spokesman Gary Susswein emailed a spreadsheet indicating the four-year rate has improved from 51 to 52 percent through Powers’ presidency. As we gathered this information, Mackowiak said by email that he picked up the graduation statistic from remarks by Cigarroa during a public interview by the Texas Tribune. In the March 28, 2013, interview, Cigarroa credited Powers for saying "we will increase the four-year graduation rate from 53 percent to 75 percent. And he put his neck out on the line and he’s going to do it." On review, Mackowiak said, it’s clear the escalated four-year graduation rate is a goal. "It’s my mistake," he wrote. At Mackowiak's nudge, the American-Statesman published a correction of his column. Our ruling Mackowiak said UT-Austin’s president had driven four-year graduation rates to 75 percent. However, the latest four-year graduation rate on the campus was no greater than 53 percent, compared to rates the same or a bit lower in the other full years of Powers’ presidency. The institution's declared goal is a four-year rate of at least 70 percent. We rate the claim as False. UPDATE, April 9, 2013: This story was updated to reflect the American-Statesman publishing a correction of Mackowiak's oped column. This did not affect our rating of his claim.

Scott Walker made a counterintuitive claim about President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, which requires the nation’s power plans to reduce their carbon emissions by nearly a third. About midway into the Sept. 16, 2015 debate, held in California, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida was expressing concerns to moderator Jake Tapper about higher utility rates and fewer jobs. That's when Walker interjected and said: "A lot of those people, though, and I'm going to echo what Senator Rubio just said. This is an issue where, we're talking about my state, it's thousands of manufacturing jobs. Thousands of manufacturing jobs for a rule the Obama administration, (its) own EPA has said will have a marginal impact on climate change." Walker’s campaign confirmed to us that the governor was referring to the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan, and to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. There are differences of opinion, of course, over how much one plan in one country can affect the global climate. But to Walker’s claim: Did the EPA -- the agency administering the Clean Power Plan -- say the plan’s regulations would have only a marginal effect on climate change? The plan In August 2015, the Obama administration announced that its Clean Power Plan regulations would require power plants to reduce carbon emissions, from 2005 levels, by 32 percent by 2030. (A 2014 draft of the plan had sought a 30 percent reduction.) Advocates said the reduction would help attack global warming and provide reductions in other emissions that create soot and smog. But the announcement prompted Walker to add Wisconsin to states that are challenging the first-ever requirements in court. The reductions won't be uniform, because individual states rely on different mixes of coal, natural gas, nuclear energy, water, wind and the sun to provide power. Wisconsin, which has traditionally relied heavily on coal, faces having to reduce emissions 34 percent-- the sixth-highest rate in the country, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. EPA’s view As for the the EPA, it has described the Clean Power Plan as a necessary, though not sufficient, step in addressing climate change -- and as part of a larger strategy to spur other nations to reduce emissions. During a July 2015 congressional hearing, U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, challenged EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy on the impact on climate change. The Texas Republican quoted a former EPA assistant secretary under Obama as saying the plan would, at most, reduce the global temperature by 1/100 of a degree Celsius. McCarthy responded by saying that the value of the plan can’t be measured that way. She said that while the plan mandates carbon emission reductions in the United States, it also aims to prod other nations to reduce their emissions and to trigger investment in technological innovations that also will reduce emissions. The value of the plan is "in showing strong domestic action, which can actually trigger global action," McCarthy said. "(I’m) not disagreeing that this action in and of itself will not make all the difference we need to address climate action. But what I'm saying is if don't take action domestically, we will never get started." (Separately, EPA spokeswoman Liz Purchia told us the agency has said the Clean Power Plan "is only one component of our larger strategy," which includes measures for vehicle fuel efficiency and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.) During the same hearing, there were fears expressed that the plan will drive up the cost of electricity to consumers. And U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., expressed concern that China, India and Russia would not reduce the growth in their carbon emissions. So, the head of the EPA acknowledges that the Clean Power Plan -- since it applies only to the United States -- can have only a limited impact on global climate change. But besides reducing carbon emissions in the United States, the plan is aimed at getting other nations to do the same. Other views We interviewed two experts about the Clean Power Plan and the EPA’s take on it: Adele Morris of the Brookings Institution’s Climate and Energy Economics Project, and Chip Knappenberger of the Cato Institute’s Center for the Study of Science. Both agreed that the United States historically is a major emitter of carbons, but growing nations such as India and China will play a larger role in future emissions. And they agreed that a key part of the EPA’s strategy with the Clean Power Plan is that as a global leader, if the United States reduces emissions, other nations might be spurred to do so, as well. Other experts have made the same point. "This appears to be an intentionally obfuscating perspective," Dallas Burtraw, a senior fellow at Resources for the Future a think tank that tracks energy policy, said of Walker's claim. "Climate change is a global problem. The contribution of U.S. efforts are greater, in my mind, for the influence they have on the behavior of the other nations of the world than for the specific reductions that the U.S. achieves. The greater contribution is leadership in this case." In June 2015 -- five months before a United Nations summit meeting aimed at forging a global accord to cut climate-warming emissions -- China submitted a plan to the U.N. detailing how it plans to reduce fossil fuel emissions by 2030. The New York Times reported that climate policy experts cited the significance of China’s plan, given that the United States and China -- the world’s top greenhouse gas polluters -- have long been viewed as the biggest obstacles to reaching a meaningful global warming deal. Our rating In the debate, Walker said the Obama administration’s "own Environmental Protection Agency" has said its Clean Power Plan "will have a marginal impact on climate change." The EPA acknowledges that the plan can have only a limited effect on global climate change, given that they order reductions in carbon emission only in the United States. But a key aim of the plan is to spur other nations to reduce their emissions, as well, and to spur new technologies that will help reduce emissions. Walker’s statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details -- our definition of Half True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2015-09-21T11:42:11	2015-09-16	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-08571	Says the U.S. Constitution provides for just compensation when land is taken under eminent domain.	true	/texas/statements/2010/sep/28/todd-staples/todd-staples-says-us-constitution-provides/	Republican Todd Staples, the state agriculture commissioner seeking re-election against Democrat Hank Gilbert, is no lawyer. But he kinda played one in a Sept. 16 interview on an Austin radio station. Staples, pitching for listeners to sign an online petition urging the 2011 Legislature to embrace "true eminent-domain reforms," told KVET-FM morning hosts Bob Cole and Bucky Godbolt: "What we're talking about is a basic constitutional right of property owners. Our United States Constitution says that if eminent domain has to be used, a property owner must be justly compensated, period." The Bill of Rights says pay up? Get out (that's just an expression). The actual language doesn't say "must," but the meaning aligns with Staples' comment. The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution says no private property shall "be taken for public use, without just compensation." Nationally, Staples is among figures to air frets about the power of government to "take" property for declared public purposes, in part reacting a 2005 U.S. Supreme Court decision, in Kelo v. City of New London, upholding a community's right to take property for an economic redevelopment project; the plaintiff had maintained the city's plan for her land did not constitute "public use" under the Fifth Amendment. According to an April 2009 article in the American Bar Association's Journal, 43 states enacted statutes or constitutional amendments restricting the use of eminent domain in the wake of the court ruling, while at least five state supreme courts issued rulings to "significantly impede government power to take private property." In Texas, the federal ruling contributed to the 2009 Legislature proposing a state constitutional amendment which voters adopted last year. The amendment prohibits the taking of private property for transfer to a private entity for the purpose of economic development or to increase tax revenues, according to the Texas Secretary of State's office. Gilbert has questioned Staples' bonafides for talking up laws against government taking private property without just compensation. In a Sept. 17 press release, the Democrat singles out measures Staples supported as a state senator to suggest he's not always aligned with private property owners. That sally may be valid; we're not judging it here. We rate Staples' statement to KVET as True.	None	Todd Staples	None	None	None	2010-09-28T06:00:00	2010-09-16	['None']
pomt-07771	A federal system that verifies employees are authorized to work in the U.S. is inaccurate "anywhere from 50 percent all the way up to in excess of 80" percent of the time.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/feb/23/david-raynor/Georgia-Chamber-E-Verify-accuracy-problems/	Backers of bills before the General Assembly argue that stopping illegal immigrants from working in Georgia can be as simple as pushing a few buttons. Just type a new employee’s name into the website of the federal program E-Verify, which confirms whether he or she can work legally in the U.S. Some employers already use it, but Georgia should make it mandatory, backers argue. Not so fast, critics say. "There are some inaccuracies that exist within pilot programs such as E-Verify," cautioned David Raynor, a lobbyist for the Georgia Chamber of Commerce, on Feb. 8 in a legislative committee meeting on one of the bills. How bad is the error rate? State Rep. Rich Golick, R-Smyrna, a co-sponsor of the bill, asked Raynor. "I don’t have it, Mr. Chairman, in front of me today. I know we’ve seen quotes from different reports that have shown anywhere from 50 percent all the way up to in excess of 80," Raynor replied. That same day, Gov. Nathan Deal noted "there are questions being raised" about E-Verify’s accuracy. Sounds bad, we thought. So, are there inaccuracies in E-Verify? House Bill 87 and Senate Bill 40 would require many businesses to use E-Verify, which handled more than 16 million queries during fiscal year 2010, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. SB 40 exempts farmers and other employers who participate in federal programs that allow noncitizens to work here legally. An employer enters a new hire’s information, which E-Verify tries to match with records from the Social Security Administration and the DHS. If there’s a match and the worker is authorized, the employee stays. If there’s no match, the system issues a "tentative nonconfirmation," which the employee can contest. If that challenge is unsuccessful, E-Verify issues a "final nonconfirmation," and the employee can be fired. E-Verify, which was originally named the "Basic Pilot Program," is mandatory for federal contractors and employers in Arizona, Mississippi, South Carolina and Utah. In Georgia, public agencies and employers with public contracts must use it. Now, on to our analysis. A chamber spokeswoman referred us to Kim Thompson, an Atlanta labor attorney who advises the chamber on E-Verify. "I wouldn’t say the problems are necessarily significant, but there are problems," Thompson said. She said she has handled cases in which E-Verify failed to confirm legal workers, but the program’s accuracy has recently improved. Thompson referred PolitiFact Georgia to the federal Government Accountability Office, which issued a report on the program in December, plus an audit of the program by independent contractor Westat, a research company. Indeed, the GAO and experts for and against making E-Verify mandatory agree that the program has improved. It’s overwhelmingly accurate for authorized workers, but it fails to catch a large percentage of illegal ones. The most current data says that overall, it was inaccurate between 2.3 and 5.7 percent of the time, according to Westat. For legal workers, its error rate was between 0.6 percent and 1 percent, Westat found. But of the workers it thought may be unauthorized, 22 percent were actually legal. E-Verify mistook legal, foreign-born workers for illegal ones 20 percent more often than it did for their U.S.-born counterparts, according to Westat. The system especially struggled with workers with Hispanic and Arab surnames, which means "increased potential exists for an adverse impact on individuals’ civil rights and civil liberties," the GAO warned. Los Angeles County, which used the program, had a harder time with E-Verify. There, it was wrong 2 percent of the time, and 95 percent of the people it thought may be illegal workers turned out to be legal, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an immigration think tank that thinks mandating E-Verify may do more harm than good. E-Verify’s biggest shortcoming was catching illegal workers. It cleared them to work an estimated 37 to 64 percent of the time. Illegal workers and shady employers often use fraudulent documents that E-Verify can’t detect, the GAO said. Whether E-Verify is accurate enough to be mandated is up for debate. "I would say that if it’s not ready now, it’s on the cusp of being ready," said Janice Kephart, an expert with the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower immigration levels. Marc Rosenblum, an immigration expert with the Migration Policy Institute, told PolitiFact Georgia that E-Verify does little for employers since it fails to catch so many unauthorized workers. He concluded in a report this month that "E-Verify remains vulnerable to identity fraud and employer misuse, and offers no ability to detect off-the-books employment." To sum up: E-Verify is overwhelmingly accurate with legal workers but fails to identify a large percentage of illegal ones. Indeed, as Raynor said, "there are some inaccuracies that exist" in E-Verify. But his suggestion the error rate ranges between 50 and 80 percent was too high. E-Verify’s worst error rate -- for illegal workers -- is high, but it’s still well below what Raynor suggested. For all workers, it shrinks to 2.3 to 5.7 percent. While Raynor’s main point was correct, he was wrong on important details about E-Verify’s overall accuracy. We therefore rule his statement Half True.

pomt-10978	"The Electoral College is much more advantageous for Democrats."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/17/donald-trump/donald-trumps-questionable-claim-electoral-college/	It may be more than a year and a half since the presidential election, but time and again, President Donald Trump has brought up his Electoral College victory in 2016 — even at unexpected moments, such as the joint press conference he held with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki on July 16, 2018. At one point, Trump said, "The Democrats lost an election which, frankly, they should have been able to win, because the Electoral College is much more advantageous for Democrats, as you know, than it is to Republicans." When we checked with political experts, they expressed skepticism that the Electoral College is "much more advantageous to the Democrats," particularly today. The myth of the "blue wall" During the 2016 campaign, there was a widespread belief among the public that there was a "blue wall" of solidly Democratic states protecting Clinton. It’s human nature to assume what has happened previously will continue into the future. So after Barack Obama, a Democrat, won the 2008 and 2012 elections, some assumed that the Democrats would have a leg up in 2016 as well. To take just one example, in 2014, a column in the conservative Washington Examiner was headlined, "How the Electoral College favors Democrats and why Republicans must change it." The column argued that the Democrats start with a base of 242 electoral votes, compared with just 170 for the Republicans. Under that scenario, the Democrats would need just 28 more electoral votes to clinch the presidency; the Republicans would have a much tougher road to winning. But there’s a catch: To get to that 242 number, the column lumped in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — with a collective 46 electoral votes — with those Democratic base states. There was some logic to that decision, as each of the three states had voted for the Democratic nominee in the previous six presidential elections. And in the case of Michigan and Wisconsin at least, Hillary Clinton’s campaign effectively agreed, largely skipping appearances in those states as Election Day neared. But there are two problems with using this argument as support for Trump’s assertion. First, the notion that Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin are bedrock Democratic states was shattered by Trump himself. And his victory undermines his assertion in Helsinki -- in the present tense -- that the Electoral College favors Democrats. Any Democratic candidate in the future isn’t going to make the same mistake Clinton did. They will consider each of these three to be battleground states. Second, contrary to the "media narrative," professional election handicappers never considered Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to be Democratic locks. While the Democrats had won them for six elections running, independent analysts typically considered them battleground states. The following chart summarizes the ratings that several nonpartisan handicappers gave to Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in the 2008, 2012, and 2016 elections, where accessible online. The handicappers are the Cook Political Report, Inside Elections, Larry Sabato’s Crystal Ball, and this author (for Stateline.org in 2008, and for Governing magazine in 2012 and 2016). These analysts use first-hand reporting, past history, and polls to produce a subjective assessment of each state; they are not mathematical models based only on poll results. The ratings "lean Democratic" and "toss-up" mean that a state is considered competitive. "Likely Democratic" is not considered to be competitive, but is less safe than the most solid category, "safe Democratic." The ratings shown are for each group’s final handicapping before Election Day. State Cook 2008 Cook 2012 Cook 2016 I.E. 2016 Sabato 2012 Sabato 2016 Stateline 2008 Govering 2012 Governing 2016 Mich. Lean D Lean D Lean D Lean D Likely D Lean D Likely D Lean D Lean D Pa. Lean D Lean D Lean D Lean D Lean D Lean D Lean D Lean D Lean D Wis. Lean D Lean D Lean D Tossup Lean D Likely D Likely D Tossup Lean D In every analysis, Pennsylvania was considered a lean Democratic state — that is, the Democrats had an edge, but the contest was competitive and hardly in the bag. Wisconsin was considered a toss-up state (the most competitive category of all) or a lean Democratic state a clear majority of the time. And Michigan was considered a lean Democratic state a clear majority of the time. So while the popular perception was that, since the Democrats had won six straight elections in each of those states they were bound to win again, professional handicappers had a more nuanced view of the Democrats’ chances in those states. This caveat didn’t always get picked up in the larger discussion. In reality, a reasonable breakdown of "base" states for each party — particularly after the 2016 results have added another data point — would give Republicans at least 179 electoral votes that are pretty safe in today’s environment. They are: Alabama (9 electoral votes), Alaska (3), Arkansas (6), Georgia (16), Idaho (4), Indiana (11), Kansas (6), Kentucky (8), Louisiana (8), Mississippi (6), Missouri (10), Montana (3), Nebraska (4 of 5 electoral votes), North Dakota (3), Oklahoma (7), South Carolina (9), South Dakota (3), Tennessee (11), Texas (38), Utah (6), West Virginia (5) and Wyoming (3). For their part, the Democrats can rely pretty solidly on states worth 187 electoral votes: California (55), Connecticut (7), Delaware (3), District of Columbia (3), Hawaii (4), Illinois (20), Maryland (10), Massachusetts (11), New Jersey (14), New York (29), New Mexico (5), Oregon (7), Rhode Island (4), Vermont (3) and Washington state (12). This leaves the following states in the battleground category and assigned to neither party, with a combined 172 electoral votes: Arizona (11), Colorado (9), Florida (29), Iowa (6), Maine (4), Michigan (16), Minnesota (10), Nebraska (1 of 5 electoral votes), Nevada (6), New Hampshire (4), North Carolina (15), Ohio (18), Pennsylvania (20), Virginia (13), and Wisconsin (10). Is this breakdown subject to disagreement? Absolutely; this list has a relatively generous threshold for counting a state as a battleground. Reasonable people will disagree. But if it’s in the ballpark, then the breakdown is 187 electoral votes to start for the Democrats, 179 to start for the Republicans, and 172 up for grabs. It’s hard to call that "much more advantageous for the Democrats." Could Republicans actually be the ones who benefit? Contrary to Trump’s assertion, there’s evidence that the Republicans may actually benefit from the Electoral College system. In the five most-recent elections starting with 2000, the Republicans have twice lost the popular vote but won the presidency thanks to the Electoral College. In 2000, Democrat Al Gore defeated Republican George W. Bush by more than 547,000 votes nationally. In 2016, Clinton defeated Trump by an even larger margin — almost 2.9 million votes. Neither of the popular vote winners became president. "That certainly doesn’t suggest the Electoral College has a Democratic bias. In fact, it indicates the opposite," said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. Two factors explain why today’s political environment, if anything, gives Republican states a leg up in the electoral college. First, smaller states get a disproportionately large impact in the Electoral College, because each state (plus the District of Columbia) gets a guaranteed two electoral votes before the rest of the electoral votes are allotted based on House seats (and thus, indirectly, on population). While there are some smaller blue states, the smallest states are disproportionately Republican-leaning. For instance, deep-red Wyoming gets one electoral vote for roughly 193,000 people, while deep-blue California gets one for every 719,000. An even bigger impact today may stem from the demographic makeup of the battleground states that shifted from Obama to Trump. Whites without college degrees — a key base of Trump’s support — "are overrepresented in swing states as compared to the country as a whole," Nate Silver of fivethirtyeight.com has written. "Sure, there were some exceptions, such as Virginia. But in the average swing state … whites without college degrees make up an average of 45.3 percent of the electorate, higher than their 41.6 percent share nationwide. That’s a big part of why Clinton won the popular vote while losing the Electoral College." Kondik said that as of today, "the Electoral College has a Trump lean because of his white, non-college coalition being an above-average share of the electorate in the key swing states of the Frost Belt. I say ‘Trump lean’ because that advantage might not be apparent for other Republicans with different coalitions in the future." Kondik’s point about changing coalitions making a difference brings up another issue: There doesn’t appear to be a permanent bias for either party, since electorates and demographics change over time. "I don't believe either party has had a long-lasting lean in the Electoral College," said David Wasserman, an analyst for the Cook Political Report. Our ruling Trump said that "the Electoral College is much more advantageous for Democrats." There may have been a popular misperception prior to the 2016 election that Democrats had a large number of solidly blue states that made it much easier for them to reach 270 than the Republicans. But professional handicappers never considered states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin to be solid for the Democrats, even in the 2008 and 2012 elections — and any notion that they continue to be solidly Democratic going forward was exploded by Trump’s wins in those states, making his use of the present tense dubious. There may even be a modest Republican lean to the Electoral College in this political moment, but we couldn’t find evidence of a permanent bias either way. We rate the statement False.

pomt-12187	"I’m one of two members of Congress out of 535 that takes no corporate cash, no political action committee money."	half-true	/texas/statements/2017/jul/27/beto-orourke/beto-orourke-claims-near-uniqueness-not-taking-cor/	U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke, the punk rocker turned Democratic politician from El Paso, vowed to go against "politics as usual" in Washington while spreading the word about his quest to challenge Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas in the 2018 elections. O’Rourke, addressing Dallas supporters at a March 2017 campaign kickoff event, provided some detail as to what that means to him. Toward the end of his remarks, he asked for personal campaign donations, adding to cheers and applause: "I’m one of two members of Congress out of 535 that takes no corporate cash, no political action committee money. I don’t want you worried that when I’m taking a vote, making a decision, writing a bill, looking at an amendment, that I’m listening to anyone but you, the people that I want to serve and that I want to represent." Nobody seeking federal office can legally accept direct corporate or union donations, the Federal Election Commission notes. Yet political action committees--open to anyone’s contributions or founded and run by individuals working for corporations or affiliated with labor unions, membership organizations or trade associations--routinely fuel campaigns. In the 2016 elections, PACs gave $472.7 million to congressional candidates, according to the campaign finance tracking website OpenSecrets.org run by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. According to the site, PAC donations accounted for 35 percent of campaign funds for House Democrats, 39 percent for House Republicans, 15 percent for Senate Democrats and 27 percent for Senate Republicans. O’Rourke amends We inquired into the basis of O’Rourke’s claim to near-uniqueness for not taking PAC money. By email, O’Rourke replied that he’d revise what he says going forward. "What I should have said," O’Rourke said, "is that there are only two members of Congress who do not take PAC money and who also do not have a leadership PAC (which gives PAC contributions to other members), myself and Ro Khanna," a California Democrat. In a March 2017 press release, Khanna said he and O’Rourke had introduced legislation barring members of Congress and aspirants from accepting PAC donations. That release grouped Khanna and O’Rourke among six House members who didn’t accept PAC donations in the run-up to the 2016 elections. That count was based, the release said, on a December 2016 breakdown of candidate finance filings posted by Colorado-based CleanSlateNow, which focuses on changing how campaigns are funded. O’Rourke’s reply to us included a different count attributed to information on the OpenSecrets site. O’Rourke wrote: "There are four members of Congress (based on the Open Secrets website) who did not take PAC money in the last cycle (either to their Congressional campaign or to their leadership PAC if they had one) -- myself, Ro Khanna, John Sarbanes and Francis Rooney. Both Sarbanes and Rooney have PACs themselves that make PAC contributions to other candidates." Reviewing web posts and records Information on the OpenSecrets site indicates that into May 2017, Cruz had raised more than $1.9 million from PACs with the contributions accounting for 2 percent of more than $117 million he’d raised starting from his 2012 election to the Senate. The comparable entry for O’Rourke doesn’t show a zero for his PAC donations. It indicates instead $297,969 in PAC contributions to O’Rourke campaigns, amounting to 5 percent of O’Rourke’s $6.3 million in contributions since 2011, the year before his initial election to the House. We asked O’Rourke’s campaign about the tallied PAC contributions. A senior adviser, David Wysong, said by phone that O’Rourke accepted such donations through his first couple of House elections but stopped doing so before seeking his third term in 2016. By email, Wysong provided a document he described as a February 2015 form letter from O’Rourke to possible PAC contributors after which, Wysong said, O’Rourke accepted no PAC donations. From O’Rourke’s letter: "Starting with this election cycle, I plan to no longer accept PAC contributions. I've made this decision in an effort to focus more of my campaign efforts on bringing new, smaller and local donors into the campaign." Wysong also emailed an example of O'Rourke turning back such such aid--an October 2016 letter from O’Rourke’s campaign manager, Brianna Carmen, returning a donation from the Treasury Employees PAC. Wysong noted too that according to an FEC summary page about O’Rourke’s Senate finance report filed in July 2017, the candidate raised more than $2 million from April through June 2017, none of that from PACs. Banana peels With help from the center’s research director, Sarah Bryner, we confirmed from the OpenSecrets site and FEC filings that O’Rourke did not bank any PAC contributions as he sought re-election in 2016 or in the first months of his Senate bid. But this proved a slog to confirm because PAC names repeatedly appear in O’Rourke’s contribution reports. His July 2017 filing with the FEC separately shows $14,580 in contributions from other candidate committees. How unique? Our first focus was on gauging the accuracy of O’Rourke’s claim to being one of two members not accepting PAC aid. After identifying each current senator and House member on the U.S. Congress website, we checked the OpenSecrets site for PAC contributions to each member; the site provides a summary page for each member showing her or his contributions by cycle and over the years. Candidate contributions are further broken down by categories including individual contributions, PAC contributions and self-financing. Here’s the site’s entry for O’Rourke covering the 2016 election cycle: SOURCE: Summary for Beto O’Rourke, OpenSecrets.org (accessed May 10, 2017) From OpenSecrets posts, we identified five House members who did not get PAC contributions before the 2016 elections: O’Rourke; Khanna; Sarbanes, D-Md.; Jared Polis, D-Colo; Rooney, R-Fla--with Polis, Khanna and Rooney also fielding no PAC aid in their House careers. A conflict we didn't settle: CleanSlateNow previously identified Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., as not getting PAC help in his 2016 re-election bid. In contrast, Roe’s OpenSecrets summary page for Roe indicates he got $6,000 in PAC donations before that election. Next, we eyeballed FEC-posted information, focusing on campaign filings by House members’ principal campaign committees for 2015-16. These records confirmed Khanna did not get PAC contributions that cycle. Otherwise, the records showed, Rooney received a $10,296 PAC contribution from Rooney Victory on Dec. 30, 2016; Sarbanes received donations from the VoteSANE PAC; and Polis logged contributions attributed to JStreetPAC, AmeriPAC and ActBlue. Similarly, our FEC search suggested that O’Rourke’s campaign in 2015-16 received $110,721 attributed to PACs (including ActBlue, JStreetPAC and the New Democrat Coalition PAC). Of this total, $74,400 in contributions were designated for the 2018 Democratic primary. So, candidates including O'Rourke took PAC aid? Not so, we found, in that the donations were almost uniformly made by individuals whose personal contribution were routed through supportive "conduit" PACs--a phrase we hadn’t heard before. It looked to us like the donation to Rooney came from a committee devoted to his candidacy. On the FEC site, the respective 2016 donations marked as "PAC" to Sarbanes, O’Rourke and Polis were each accompanied by a column describing the donations as a "conduit total," with a note stating the donation was "earmarked through this organization." We sought more information about ActBlue, the largest aggregator of individual contributions among the PACs linked to O’Rourke. The group says on its web site that it offers tools to help Democratic candidates but it’s not a traditional PAC that rounds up donations and obscures specific donors. ActBlue says it "acts as a conduit federally and in most states, which means we provide the infrastructure for campaigns and organizations to fundraise online, but we don’t fundraise on behalf of anyone. Unlike groups that spend large sums of cash from undisclosed sources, ActBlue offers grassroots donors a way to give fully disclosed donations to the candidates and causes they choose," the group says. CONDUIT PAC DONATIONS TO BETO O’ROURKE CAMPAIGN, 2016 CONDUIT PAC NAME INDIVIDUAL DONATIONS AGGREGATE TOTAL ActBlue 121 $77,294 ActBlue Technical Services 74 $14,070 JStreet PAC 21 $16,140 New Democrat Coalition 9 $4,501 SOURCE: Spreadsheet listing contributions to O’Rourke campaign, based on search of Federal Election Commission website, June 2016, PolitiFact Texas In July 2017, when we looked afresh at the OpenSecrets summary page for O’Rourke in 2017-18, it showed $29,160 in PAC contributions to O’Rourke’s Senate campaign. A few days later, the chart indicated $43,740 in PAC donations. Red flags? Negative, Bryner told us, saying the charts summarizing O’Rourke’s Senate contributions were erroneous and would be rectified. Significantly, Bryner also showed us how to query an FEC site that provides detailed files about all candidates, parties and other political committees. From the site, we fetched a July 23, 2017 commission list itemizing more than 45,000 PAC contributions to congressional candidates in the 2017-18 election cycle. That list showed no PAC contributions to O’Rourke. Experts concur We asked campaign finance experts to guide us to documentation distinguishing donations through conduit PACs from traditional PAC contributions. Judith Ingram, press officer at the FEC, showed us that in quarterly filings, ActBlue donations present an individual name as a line item below each listing of ActBlue as a donor, along with a text field that explains the individual donation is part of a conduit total. Ingram further confirmed that the JStreet PAC contributions reported by O’Rourke were made by individual donors employing the PAC as a conduit. Stephen Spaulding, chief of strategy at the nonpartisan watchdog group Common Cause, echoed Ingram’s comments--that groups such as ActBlue act as intermediaries by processing payments that "can be attributed to an actual donor, a human being." If a donation was a traditional PAC contribution, Spaulding explained, the listed contributor would be the PAC alone, and there wouldn’t be a specific individual’s name linked to it. Our ruling O’Rourke said: "I’m one of two members of Congress out of 535 that takes no corporate cash, no political action committee money." Unsaid: no candidate can take corporate cash; that’s illegal. Otherwise, we found, O’Rourke was one of at least five (not two) House incumbents to keep no PAC contributions in the run-up to the 2016 elections. He also hasn’t accepted PAC aid into 2017 though he drew on about $297,000 in PAC donations in his House bids of 2012 and 2014--actions not recapped in his Dallas call for contributions.

pomt-10533	"He (Obama) chairs the subcommittee on Europe. ... He's held not one substantive hearing to do oversight."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/27/hillary-clinton/dormant-while-obama-campaigns/	In one of the more pointed barbs in a Feb. 26, 2008, debate, Sen. Hillary Clinton charged that Sen. Barack Obama has been so busy running for president that he hasn't done much of anything as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs. "I also have heard Senator Obama refer continually to Afghanistan, and he references being on the Foreign Relations Committee," Clinton said. "He chairs the Subcommittee on Europe. It has jurisdiction over NATO. NATO is critical to our mission in Afghanistan. He's held not one substantive hearing to do oversight, to figure out what we can do to actually have a stronger presence with NATO in Afghanistan." Obama responded: "Well, first of all, I became chairman of this committee at the beginning of this campaign, at the beginning of 2007. So it is true that we haven't had oversight hearings on Afghanistan." Although Obama acknowledges the point, we sought to confirm what the subcommittee has been doing. Congressional records show, and spokesmen for several subcommittee members confirm, the subcommittee has not held any policy hearings since Obama was appointed chair in early 2007. The subcommittee's jurisdiction includes "all matters, policies and problems concerning the continent of Europe, including the European member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." The chair sets the agenda for a subcommittee and Obama could have asked to hold a hearing on NATO and its role in Afghanistan. But Clinton's claim, while technically true, is unfair, said Andrew J. Fischer, a spokesman for Republican Sen. Richard Lugar. Lugar now serves as a minority member of the Foreign Relations Committee, but he was the chair, from 2003 to 2006, when Republicans controlled the Senate. He is the ranking Republican on the committee. Fischer, who is a minority staff member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said something as major as NATO's role in Afghanistan would typically be held before the full Foreign Relations Committee, rather than Obama's European subcommittee. In fact, the Foreign Relations Committee held a hearing on Afghanistan on Jan. 31, 2008, and NATO was a part of the discussion. Obama attended a Democratic debate in California that day. Clinton is not on the committee. The Clinton campaign put out a statement reiterating Clinton's comments to reinforce the theme that Obama is more about talk than action. "Given the opportunity to take the reins of leadership and shape two critical areas of U.S. foreign policy — Afghanistan and our alliances in Europe — Senator Obama has done next to nothing," the statement said. Obama's campaign did not respond to a request for comment. So let's look at Clinton's statement: "He chairs the subcommittee on Europe." Yep. "It has jurisdiction over NATO." Yep. "NATO is critical to our mission in Afghanistan. He's held not one substantive hearing to do oversight, to figure out what we can do to actually have a stronger presence with NATO in Afghanistan." Yep. Some may argue that the issue of NATO's role in Afghanistan typically and more appropriately would come before the full Foreign Relations Committee. But Clinton is right when she says Obama's subcommittee has been largely dormant while Obama has campaigned for president. We rate her comment True.

pomt-03379	Economic Development Commission Executive Director Keith Stokes "sent me a letter and he said the taxpayers will never be on the hook for these bonds" for 38 Studios.	true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/jul/10/charlene-lima/rhode-island-rep-charlene-lima-said-economic-devel/	One of the hot-button issues of the 2013 General Assembly session was whether the state should repay the bonds sold to help finance 38 Studios, the now-bankrupt video-game company founded by former Boston Red Sox player Curt Schilling. One state representative who has argued against repayment is Charlene Lima, a Democrat from Cranston. She told the House on June 26 that, before the bonds were sold in November 2010, she had been promised by the executive director of the Rhode Island Economic Development Commission (RIEDC) that taxpayers would not have to foot the bill if the deal with 38 Studios didn't live up to its promise. "When I was complaining to the former director, Keith Stokes, he sent me a letter and he said the taxpayers will never be on the hook for these bonds, for this money," Lima said. "How was this properly vetted by these people if they were saying the taxpayers wouldn't be on the hook? And guess what. Today they ARE on the hook." We're not going to get into the merits of the state’s controversial decision to start paying the cost of the "moral obligation" bonds, but we wondered whether Stokes, who resigned after 38 Studios collapsed, really had made a specific pledge in writing. We called Lima and she quickly forwarded a copy of an Oct. 4, 2010 letter from Stokes in which he complained that Lima had offered an "inaccurate characterization of this investment and the RIEDC's degree of concern for Rhode Island taxpayers" in a news release she had authored. At the time, the bond sale had been approved and the bonds themselves were about to be sold. Stokes wrote, "In the unlikely event that the company is not able to meet its debt obligations," the state would have first crack at 38 Studio's assets. "These collateral assets, in addition to the debt repayment reserves, would be used to pay back the loan before the application of any public funds would be considered. "This ensures that under no circumstances would taxpayers be asked to repay $75 million." As Lima now notes, taxpayers are being asked to pay the money. (The $8.2-billion state budget, which the General Assembly passed and Governor Chafee signed, included $2.5 million for the first required taxpayer payment on the bonds. The total owed, with interest, is about $112.6 million.) To sum up, Lima said she received a letter in 2010 from then-RIEDC official Keith Stokes in which he insisted that Rhode Islanders would not be on the hook for the 38 Studios bonds. Lima earned a Pants on Fire last month for a comment she made about Rhode Island's failure to pass the Constitutional amendment authorizing the federal income tax. "If my pants were on fire," she said, "what is he? A towering inferno?" We don't have varying levels of conflagration. And in this case, we're simply judging the claim Lima made on the House floor. She has the evidence and we rate her statement True. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com.

pomt-14912	"Smog was invented in Los Angeles. It was. The name was invented. There was a fellow at Caltech and he came up with the idea and they called it smog."	half-true	/california/statements/2015/nov/03/jerry-brown/jerry-browns-hazy-claim-l-invents-smog/	LISTEN TO THIS STORY: Sunshine, Hollywood and freeway gridlock are all inextricably linked to Los Angeles, and so is smog. But was the City of Angels the first to create the noxious, eye-stinging, smudgy haze? Weren’t other industrial cities spewing thick black smoke and creating smog centuries ago? As it turns out, it depends on what you consider ‘smog.’ Gov. Jerry Brown, a warrior in the state’s air pollution battles, offered his California-centric version of smog’s history during a speech in Los Angeles in October. "Smog was invented in Los Angeles. It was," the governor told an audience at Griffith Observatory, with downtown Los Angeles cloaked in a brown haze several miles away, as shown in photos of the event. "The name was invented. There was a fellow at Caltech and he came up with the idea and they called it smog." The governor made the claim during a ceremony marking the signing of California’s landmark climate change bill, SB 350. It requires the state to get 50 percent of its electricity from air-friendly, renewable energy sources by 2030. We decided to fact-check Brown’s "smog was invented in Los Angeles" statement, to cut through what seemed like a dubious claim. Smog checking First, it’s clear L.A. has no ownership over the term smog. Brown sounds like he was having some fun with the "invented in Los Angeles" portion, from listening to him speak. Still, he was literally and blatantly wrong. News articles from as early as 1905 credit London doctor Harold Des Veaux with coining the word smog to describe natural fog contaminated by smoke, according to the Oxford English Dictionary. Great Britain’s affliction with foul air is referenced in Shakespeare’s Macbeth, written in 1606. But its soot-choked skies date as far back as the 12th century, when wood became scarce and residents turned to burning coal to keep warm, according to a history of the country’s air pollution by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. It’s clear that other urban centers fought the effects of smog long before anyone imagined the metropolis we call Los Angeles. So, what kind of smoke was the governor blowing? "Jerry Brown -- brilliant as he is -- is confusing some facts," said Chip Jacobs, author of Smogtown: The Lung-Burning History of Pollution in Los Angeles. "We didn’t invent smog. Smog has been known to arise in many parts of the world well before he was born." We were headed for a False or Pants On Fire! Then, Jacobs added this comment: "Brown did have something right in his jumbled pronouncement -- the Caltech professor." Was there some truth behind the governor’s inartful statement? To get a better picture, we contacted the California Institute of Technology, based in Pasadena. School officials confirmed that Brown was referring to a 1940s-era Caltech professor named Arie Haagen-Smit. Haagen-Smit was the first to prove that automobile exhaust, when exposed to sunlight, creates what’s referred to as photochemical smog, or modern-day smog. It’s the same hazy brown gunk that’s polluted Los Angeles’ air for more than half a century. And it is different from the thick, black coal-driven smoke of London’s industrial era. "Professor Haagen-Smit did not invent (photochemical) smog, but he discovered the mechanism behind it. This has often been described as inventing smog," wrote Professor Richard Flagan, who teaches chemical engineering at Caltech, in an email. Another expert on air quality in Los Angeles said the governor’s claim is less murky than it appears. "The term smog was used earlier, but it meant something totally different. The definition totally morphed," said Sarah Elkind, a history professor at San Diego State University. "Los Angeles was the first city to deal with photo-chemical smog, which is part of the reason why I would judge Gov. Brown’s statement as mostly correct," added Elkind, author of the book How Local Politics Shape Federal Policy: Business, Power, and the Environment in Twentieth Century Los Angeles. A spokesman for the governor said in an email that Haagen-Smit "was the first one who coined the term for the modern air pollution produced by motor vehicles that we think of today." He also acknowledged that the term smog had been used to describe other types of pollution long before the 1940s. Our ruling Gov. Jerry Brown said: "Smog was invented in Los Angeles. It was. The name was invented. There was a fellow at Caltech and he came up with the idea and they called it smog." A look at historical sources shows the term smog dates back more than a century. It was coined by a London doctor to refer to the smoky black air that fouled Great Britain during its industrial period. Brown’s statement ignores this history, viewing smog’s origin with only a California lens. But looking deeper, a gradual shift in the term’s meaning took place in the 1940s and 1950s as scientists, including Caltech professor Arie Haagen-Smit, studied the cause of Los Angeles’ persistent and foul brown haze. In his statement, the governor references Haagen-Smit, who is credited as the first to prove L.A.’s smog was caused by automobile exhaust, and who at least one current Caltech professor says is "often described as inventing smog." The governor’s statement, while fuzzy at first glance, is partially accurate. But it leaves out important details and takes information out of context. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-11087	Say a boy was 'caged' in a wire enclosure.	false	/texas/statements/2018/jun/15/tweets/tweeted-photo-inaccurately-indicates-boy-caged-fed/	A photo made us wonder if a small boy was placed in a cage with other youngsters as part of federal authorities cracking down on families trying to cross from Mexico into the U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced April 6, 2018 that Homeland Security would refer all illegal border crossings to the Justice Department for prosecution. Parents faced with criminal charges would hence go to detention centers, leaving their children unaccompanied and subject to being housed separately by the government. Toward the end of May 2018, The Washington Post reported that the government lately had custody of more than 10,700 children in shelters. That story didn’t mention any children getting held behind bars or inside cages. Also that month, President Donald Trump accurately said in a tweet that Democrats had just mistakenly depicted four-year-old photos of children behind bars as if the children were recently confined in such conditions. The photo that drew our attention appeared in a June 11, 2018, tweet showing the boy in a cage with what looks like three other children, his fingers gripping the enclosure’s wire frame, his face fretful. By the time we saw it, the debunkists at Snopes.com had concluded that the photo was "miscaptioned" because it was snapped at a protest staged in Texas, Snopes said. Tweet features photo The tweet showcasing the photo was posted by Jose Antonio Vargas, a journalist and filmmaker, and it doesn’t say where the photo was taken--whether at a protest or inside a facility. Vargas’s tweet otherwise says: "This is what happens when a government believes people are ‘illegal.’ Kids in cages." Vargas further said, in a tweet responding to his photo tweet, that he’d pulled the image from a friend’s Facebook page and hadn’t determined its precise origin. "I shared it," Vargas tweeted, because "when I was detained in McAllen in 2014, I was with boys who were locked up. It wasn’t okay then; it’s not okay now." Snopes.com specified that the photo was taken at a Texas protest June 10, 2018, though we saw that a string of protest photos posted on Facebook as noted by Snopes did not include the specific photo of the boy caged. Utah journalist identifies photographer Nothing we saw on Facebook from the organization credited by Snopes with posting the photo, the Texas chapter of the Brown Berets de Cemanahuac, presented the photo. But our online searches yielded a June 12, 2018, declaration directed at Vargas on Twitter. "This photo," the tweet at Vargas says, "was taken by Leroy Peña as part of a protest with the Brown Berets on June 10th, presumably in Texas." That nudge, which we spotted in a June 13, 2018, post about the photo on the Twitchy website, was attributed to Utah journalist-activist Kaz Weida. Yet by the time we saw Weida’s tweet, we noticed the web link Weida offered to the original photo didn’t lead to a live web page. We also didn’t spot the photo in scrolling through Peña’s public Facebook posts from what looked to us like the June 10, 2018, protest in Dallas that included children standing inside a four-sided open-topped enclosure erected outside a building. Next, we sought help from Weida, who suggested by email that we plug the link she’d tweeted into the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, which compiles and saves web posts. Following that guidance, we saw that the archive on June 12, 2018 saved what appeared to be a copy of Peña’s since-deleted 7:46 a.m. June 11, 2018 Facebook post featuring a message atop two versions of the photo showing the unhappy boy fenced in. Peña opened that Facebook post: "This was part of our protest yesterday, but this is actually going on right now, at this very moment, in child detention centers throughout this country." Dallas resident says he took photo Next, we connected with Peña, who responded to our Facebook message by giving an interview by phone in which he said he’d taken and posted the photos of the boy. At the moment he took the photo, Peña said, the boy had just followed his older brother through a gate into the enclosure set up for the protest outside City Hall in Dallas. Peña said that after getting behind the fencing, the boy spotted his mother outside the space--which explains his wrenched look. Peña, who said he lives in Dallas, said the boy’s mother quickly fetched him. "He was only in there 30 seconds," Peña said. We reached out about the tweeted photo to Homeland Security and the Administration for Children and Families within the Department of Health and Human Services, which has oversight of children transferred into government custody when adults are detained, and didn’t hear back. Our ruling A photo tweeted in opposition to federal authorities separating children from parents detained at the U.S.-Mexico border showed what looked like an unhappy boy in a cage. The photo wasn’t taken of a boy in custody, we found. Rather, the child was in an open-topped enclosure temporarily erected for a June 2018 Texas protest of the separation of children from parents.

pomt-10599	Says he was the only Republican candidate at a prior debate who said lower-income workers were being hurt by the economy.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/24/mike-huckabee/his-recollections-are-way-off/	At a debate in Boca Raton on Jan. 24, 2008, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee suggested that he was more in touch with how the economy was hurting working people than the other GOP candidates. He said he was the only candidate at a prior debate — the one on Oct. 9, 2007 — to point out that middle- and lower-income Americans were feeling economic pain. "A few months ago, when we were all in Dearborn, Mich., your network was the sponsor, with CNBC and MSNBC, and every one of us were asked, 'How's the economy doing?' " Huckabee said during the debate in Boca Raton. "Every one of my colleagues said, 'It's doing great.' And they gave all the numbers. ... The truth is I was the only guy on that stage who said, 'It may be doing great if you're at the top. It's different if you're on the bottom.' " We find Huckabee's recollections are way off the mark. He is correct that he indicated some sympathy for working people during the Oct. 9 debate. He plugged his proposal for a national sales tax to help the less fortunate regain their footing. "The people who handle the bags and make the beds at our hotels and serve the food, many of them are having to work two jobs, and that's barely paying the rent. And you know what else? They don't think that they can afford for their kids to go to college; they're pretty sure they're not going to be able to afford health insurance," he said. But he is wrong about the comments of his rivals. Huckabee might have been the biggest pessimist that night, but Ron Paul, John McCain, Mitt Romney and Fred Thompson each noted that Michigan residents were suffering as a result of their state's battered economy. Paul suggested it was because the nation was living beyond its means while McCain stated the United States was losing industrial jobs and not taking care of those who are left behind. Others qualified their statements, depicting Michigan as something of an anomaly in an otherwise strong economy. Romney said his birth state was "undergoing a one-state recession." And Thompson said while pockets of the economy were having difficulty, he had no reason to believe the country was heading for a recession. While Huckabee gets the award for tough-talking realist, he was hardly alone in acknowledging hard times. For that reason, we judge his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09422	St. Pete Beach's local version of Amendment 4 resulted in "seemingly endless lawsuits (that) decimated the city's legal budget and forced the city to raise the property tax rate."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/mar/16/citizens-lower-taxes-and-stronger-economy/referendums-over-growth-issues-forced-city-raise-t/	In its campaign to discredit a ballot initiative giving voters more authority over land use, a statewide political action committee says voters only need to look at tiny St. Pete Beach and its problems since adopting a similar policy. Amendment 4, which will appear on ballots in November, essentially would give citizens veto power over major development proposals and land use changes. Opponents say a similar citizen initiative on growth and planning in St. Pete Beach has resulted in government run amok. "The seemingly endless lawsuits (as a result of the changes) decimated the city's legal budget and forced the city to raise the property tax rate. Now this idea threatens every town in Florida," a narrator states during a 2 minute, 15 second Web ad produced by a group called Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy. The group is an offshoot of Floridians for Smarter Growth, which is funded by developers, home builders, U.S. Sugar, and other business groups. We'll begin by noting that there is considerable debate between supporters and opponents of Amendment 4 if St. Pete Beach's experiences are truly analogous to the statewide ballot proposal. We plan to examine the analogy in a future Truth-O-Meter item. But because the advertisement is now on the Web, we'll still examine the individual claims. For this item, we need to go way back in time, back to the day that developers actually were interested in building condo high rises, back when developers wanted to cram as many units as they could onto a property, back when people actually could flip condos for substantial profits. Yep, way back to 2005. Back then, St. Pete Beach's five-member City Commission was considering changing the town's road map for growth, the Comprehensive Plan. The commission considered incentives to lure additional hotels that could increase the density of a development and change the allowed uses. The talk of change didn't sit well with many residents, who formed a group called Citizens for Responsible Growth. They collected enough petitions to get a proposal on the ballot that would require voter approval for height increases and other changes to land use plans. It got contentious. The city sued to stop the vote, and appeared to have won, but then lost on appeal. A developer also sued saying the petition process was costing him money. Voters narrowly approved most of the changes to the City Charter in November 2006, making St. Pete Beach the first town in Florida where residents directly controlled development decisions. Voters also elected two members of Citizens for Responsible Growth to the City Commission, giving them a majority. That prompted a pro-developer group -- Save Our Little Village -- to start its own petition drive to amend the city's comprehensive plan. The city's elected officials -- who had gone from being largely pro-development to anti-development -- tried to stop them. It got even more contentious. Save Our Little Village sued. The city's attorney resigned under pressure from the commission. Then, another election, another change of power and eventually, another referendum. This time, the pro-development side won. By December 2009, the city was involved in six different lawsuits prompted by the policy. Now there's another lawsuit and talk of another petition drive. Whew. Again, we're not ready to address the question of the similarity between the beach policy and Amendment 4. We're here to examine the policy's impact on the city's tax rate. And yes, in 2009, the city did increase its tax rate .107 mills (or $0.107 for every $1,000 of taxable value). The tax rate increase raised about $255,000 citywide, according to the city budget. During the Sept. 21, 2009, meeting where the tax rate increase was approved, there were two main reasons cited: Declining property values. City Manager Mike Bonfield said that property values have decreased more than 10 percent, and that as a result, the town would still be taking in $385,000 less in property tax collections -- even with a higher tax rate. The tax rate increase is needed "to fund a variety of services we provide in the city," Bonfield said. Legal fees. City Commissioner Jim Parent suggested the city might increase its legal budget from $200,000 to $250,000 to pay for potential litigation related to development issues and a possible lawsuit with Pinellas County over emergency medical services. The city already had budgeted an extra $100,000 for fiscal year 2010, according to budget documents. Parent said he was worried that after the city overshot its legal budget in 2008-2009 by about $100,000, that it would do so again. "Without additional budgeted funds, it could force us to reduce some other things," said Parent, who suggested the city's Fourth of July fireworks display could be impacted. But after discussion, and after consultation with City Attorney Michael Davis, commissioners decided to to leave the legal budget the same. After reviewing the discussion and interviewing Bonfield, we conclude that declining property values appeared to be the most significant factor, although the cost of legal fees was also discussed. "I guess you could attribute the extra legal fees as a reason why we needed to raise millage," Bonfield said. "But nobody said we need to raise this millage to put it in a fund for legal. I wouldn't say there's a direct correlation." In its ad, the group Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy says St. Pete Beach's local version of Amendment 4 resulted in "seemingly endless lawsuits (that) decimated the city's legal budget and forced the city to raise the property tax rate." Yes, there were lawsuits, but they weren't the only costs mentioned for the city legal department. Yes, the city slightly raised its rate in 2009 -- although the net result still was a decrease on most homeowners because of sharply falling property values. But the discussion at a town meeting indicates that the decision was motivated by several factors, most notably the decline in property values, as well as legal fees. So we find the claim Half True.

pomt-14696	"We have completely turned our economy around."	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/jan/12/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-he-completely-turned-around-florid/	Gov. Rick Scott kicked off the 2016 legislative session by touting Florida’s growth under his guidance, which he said was an about-face from the direction the state was headed before he took office. "We have completely turned our economy around, and more families are thriving here today than five years ago," he said during his State of the State address in the Capitol on Jan. 12, 2016. The part about more thriving families (and there are more, with Florida last year officially becoming the country’s third-largest state) is too subjective to explore in detail. But what about the economy? We wanted to see if Scott was right about whether Florida’s economy had reversed direction from five years ago. Our look at the data shows the state has turned several economic corners, but the picture isn't so bright when you look at wages. Florida’s numbers In January 2011, Scott inherited an economy ravaged by the worst recession in decades, a housing market in the tank and a double-digit unemployment rate. There were signs the state was already climbing out of the doldrums before Scott took office (the national recession officially ended in mid 2009), but Florida’s recovery was good enough to win Scott a second term. When we asked Scott’s office for evidence, they sent us some selected statistics to support his statement, including reductions in state debt and environmental permitting times. We decided to compare some key indicators that economists said would best illustrate how the economy had changed in order to see where Florida is now. We compared from 2010, the year before Scott’s first term started, to the most recent numbers available. We learned the state has performed better under certain measures than others. Unemployment rate: In November 2015, the unemployment rate in Florida was 5 percent, the same as the national rate. That’s the lowest Florida’s rate has been since January 2008. November’s rate is still a preliminary figure, but it’s much lower than the 10.7 percent it was in December 2011. Payroll employment per month: It’s true the state has added jobs. The latest figures show that between December 2010 and November 2015, Florida added 1,011,800 private-sector jobs. But when you subtract the 27,300 government jobs that have been lost in that same span, the net change is 984,500 new jobs. Per capita personal income: This statistic refers to how much income was earned per person in the state. The U.S. Commerce Department Bureau of Economic Analysis, which measures income starting midyear, says that in 2009-10, income in Florida grew 2.2 percent. But then that growth slowed down each year. In the last fiscal year data available, 2012-13, that figure dropped by -0.1 percent. Per capita real GDP: This measures all of the inflation-adjusted economic activity per person in Florida. In 2009-10, per capita real GDP dropped by 1 percent. In 2013-14, the latest year available, it was growing by 1.2 percent. That amounts to $38,664 per person in 2014, about $300 more than it was in 2010. Last year Florida’s per capita real GDP lagged the national average by more than $10,000. Industrial production: The BLS maintains a national index that measures the value of manufacturing output, compared to a "base" rate of 100, but Moody’s Analytics maintains proprietary estimates for each state. In December 2010, this rate was 96.56 for Florida, and by November 2015 was 105.93, moving ahead but slightly behind the national average. The big takeaway: Florida’s employment picture has improved, but many of the newly created jobs aren’t necessarily paying very well. Can Scott take credit? There are other measures, of course, and they all can look at the picture from different angles. Florida’s poverty rate in 2010 was 16 percent, for example, but after dropping for two years, it was up to 16.7 percent in 2014, almost two points above the national average. The state’s median household income has been dropping over the years, and currently lags the national average by about $6,000. Economists told us that Florida is mirroring the United States in economic terms — the country is doing better, so Florida is doing better. The economy here also has a focus on service and hospitality jobs, which often are minimum wage and part time, so the quality of Florida’s figures can (and often do) lag behind national averages. On top of that, Scott’s claim doesn’t reflect that Florida still has a way to go to top the state’s previous historical growth. For example, the unemployment rate was as low as 3.1 percent in mid 2006. "Floridians are just recovering back to where they were before," said Tara Sinclair, chief economist at Indeed and economics professor at George Washington University. "I don’t think that’s the American Dream, to struggle to get back to how things were." Economists also noted there are issues with how to compare these indicators because of how they are calculated or the time frames they encompass. Furthermore, Scott is taking credit for things that are mostly out of his control. Experts reminded us states are often affected by factors like shifting demographics, national trends and the global economy more than the policies of any one official or the Legislature. "Like the quarterback of a football team, he gets too much credit when the economy does well and too much blame when the economy does poorly," Moody’s economist Chris Lafakis said. "Scott has benefitted from being governor at an advantageous time of the business cycle." Our ruling Scott said, "We have completely turned our economy around." Economic indicators show that some factors, like job growth and unemployment, have reversed losses from previous years. But while there is more economic activity than before, incomes are down and remain below national averages. Experts agree Scott and lawmakers can’t take much credit for changes either way.

pomt-15351	"In a majority of states, you can now marry freely, but can still be fired for who you love."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jul/09/mark-pocan/mark-pocan-says-most-states-dont-have-workplace-pr/	After the U.S. Supreme Court announced its decision making same-sex marriage the law of the land, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan called for additional rights to be recognized for gay Americans. Pocan, a Democrat from Madison, has long been an advocate of government allowing same-sex marriage. Years after Pocan married his partner in Canada, he made headlines in 2013 when his husband was issued an ID given only to spouses of members of Congress. Pocan issued a statement on June 26, 2015 praising the high court’s landmark ruling, but also to argue the fight for gay rights is not over. "Today, the Supreme Court has reaffirmed what a majority of Americans already know: all couples should have the right to marry, regardless of who they love. "As we celebrate this victory, we must also recognize that we still have work to do to ensure all Americans are treated fairly under the law, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity." The next step in the gay rights movement: "In a majority of states you can now marry freely," Pocan said, "but can still be fired because of who you love." The first part of Pocan's claim refers back to the Supreme Court ruling. And after the ruling, Pocan is obviously on point -- not only is same sex marriage permitted in a majority of states, it is allowed everywhere. But what about the second half of the claim, which focuses on workplace discrimination. Can someone be legally terminated in most states because of their sexual orientation? Let’s take a look. The legal landscape The Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects workers from discrimination at the federal level. Title VII of the law prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin. Title VII's definitions of "because of sex" and "on the basis of sex" do not mention sexual orientation. So, there is no federal law that explicitly forbids employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. Legislation has been proposed and failed in nearly every Congress since 1974 that would prohibit employment discrimination because of sexual orientation or gender identity. In the 1989 Supreme Court case Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, the court ruled sex stereotyping is a form of discrimination protected against under Title VII. Some extend this ruling to protect gay workers who do not conform to gender norms. Gwendolyn Leachman, an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin Law School, said evidence showing the employee was discriminated against for failure to conform to gender stereotypes is necessary. "If the employer can show that the harassment or other adverse action was motivated ‘purely’ by sexual orientation, then the employee is out of luck," Leachman said. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the agency tasked with enforcing the Title VII, has interpreted Title VII protections to include sexual orientation. Some courts follow the EEOC interpretation. In Terveer v. Billington, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in March 2014 that the discrimination based on someone's status as homosexual was based on gender stereotypes and was covered under Title VII. But not all courts agree. In fact, Terveer v. Billington is an outlier. And the Supreme Court has yet to hear a case on this matter. For a worker to have legal protection from discrimination based on sexual orientation, the worker would need to live in a state -- or a city -- that prohibits it. With protections in place, a worker could file a wrongful termination lawsuit on that basis. Nearly every state has adopted an anti-discrimination law similar to the federal Civil Rights Act. Indeed, many of the state laws provide additional protection for sexual orientation. In a June 2014 fact check of another statement made by Pocan, we learned Wisconsin was the first state to enact a law banning discrimination because of sexual orientation. So how many states followed suit? Pocan's team sent a map from the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT civil rights advocacy group, to support his claim. The map showed that 22 states have explicit laws protecting workers from discrimination based on sexual orientation. That means 28 states -- a majority -- do not have explicit laws protecting workers from discrimination based on sexual orientation. Our rating Pocan said, "in a majority of states you can now marry freely, but can still be fired for who you love." Federal law does not explicitly protect against this discrimination, though the agency tasked with enforcing the law has interpreted federal protections to include sexual orientation. Meanwhile, 28 out of 50 states do not have such laws. We rate Pocan’s claim Mostly True.	None	Mark Pocan	None	None	None	2015-07-09T10:45:00	2015-06-26	['None']
pomt-12585	House Bill 991 "could lead to the opening of as many as 2,000 new liquor stores."	true	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/apr/07/wendell-young/wait-there-could-be-how-many-new-liquor-stores-pa/	Could a bill moving through the statehouse bring 2,000 new liquor stores to Pennsylvania? United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1776 President Wendell Young estimated that figure in an op-ed for PennLive, opposing two pieces of proposed legislation that would expand liquor sales outside of state stores. He noted that a bill sponsored by State Rep. Adam Harris, a Republican from Juniata County, might yield that increase. "The Harris bill (HB991) would allow some existing retailers to operate a ‘franchise store,’ which is a liquor store operating inside of an existing retail shop," Young wrote last week. "Just think of a mini liquor store next to the potato chips at your corner grocery store. The bill could lead to the opening of as many as 2,000 new liquor stores." Last summer, the state legislature passed a bill that made it legal to buy wine in (select) grocery stores for the first time since Prohibition. Pro-privatization advocates argue that loosening the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board’s grip on sales could lead to an economic boon, while providing more options for consumers, particularly rural ones. Advocates against expanding private retail, like Young, contend that a cash-strapped state can’t afford the loss in revenue. "Pennsylvania has a very successful wine and spirits system... that benefits all taxpayers whether they drink or not," said Young. "You don’t have to be a genius to figure it out, if you dilute Pennsylvania’s market, you’re going to cannibalize sales." The Liquor Control Board currently administers 608 state stores. Harris’ bill, which dropped "franchise store" for "retail store" in its current language, would indeed allow for a dramatic spike. Per the bill itself, "Licenses may be issued at a ratio of one per every 6,000 residents within a county, with a minimum of 15 licenses granted to a county." But the bill would place some limits within those margins: Stores wouldn’t be licensed in dry towns or "within 1,200 yards of a Pennsylvania Liquor Store or retail store in an urbanized area, or within two miles of a Pennsylvania Liquor Store or retail store in a rural area." The bill, which passed in committee on Monday, would require that licensed retailers purchase their stock through the Liquor Control Board. The Census estimated the state’s population to be 12,784,227 residents for 2016. Divided by 6,000, that would make way for roughly 2,130 stores before distance stipulations came into play. But since the bill notes that licenses would be granted by county, the union went further in its analysis. Chris Naylor, legislative and political director for UFCW Local 1776, provided this outline of how they devised their estimate: "Philadelphia at 1,548,647 people would be divided by 6,000, which would result in 258 potential licenses in the city of Philadelphia alone. For the surrounding counties, Montgomery would be at approx 134 potential licenses, Bucks at 104 licenses, Delco at 93 licenses and Chester at 84 licenses. Do this math over every county in the state, and you will have over 2,000 potential licenses as a result of HB 991. You also have to take into account that the legislation calls for a minimum of 15 licenses granted to a county; so the counties that fall below 90,000 residents (6,000 residents multiplied by the minimum of 15 retail outlets per county) would also appear to have 15 potential licenses per county. There are over 30 counties in the state that fall into this category, also increasing the potential number of outlets." (Note: Naylor’s Census population figures appear to be based on 2013 estimates. Philly, Montco and Chesco would each have a couple more stores, based on 2016 numbers.) Harris doesn’t dispute Young’s figure, but doesn’t believe that this many issued licenses would be likely. He’s also open to amendments. "This is sort of a starting point," he told PolitiFact Pennsylvania. "I’ve heard from members in Philadelphia, where there is stop-and-go problem. I’d be willing to pull that number back if that makes people more comfortable." He emphasized that the legislation is seeking to provide better options for rural shoppers. "As you venture out into the country, you either don’t have a store close, or don’t have [large] store," he said. "We want to fill those voids in rural counties. I’m from Juanita— We have one liquor store." The population of Juniata County is roughly 25,000. "We might lower the maximum per county (regardless of population) to something lower than 15. I am open to discussing this possibility with my colleagues and the Governor," Harris hinted later in an email. "The ‘fencing’ language (how far a retail outlet has to be from a current LCB store) could be amended to provide for a greater buffer area… If we expand the fencing this could impact how many retail licenses ultimately come into existence." Our ruling Wendell Young, president of Local 1776, wrote in an op-ed that HB 991 "could lead to the opening of as many as 2,000 new liquor stores." Even though the bill sponsor doesn’t think the legislation would create that many new locations, Young’s estimate was indisputably fair here. We rate the claim True.

pomt-11535	"There’s a large number of schools in Texas that don’t even offer sex education."	half-true	/texas/statements/2018/feb/14/andrew-white/andrew-white-texas-schools-not-offer-sex-education/	Houston businessman Andrew White, a Democratic aspirant for governor, said that when he’s elected, he’ll step up sex education in schools. White, speaking in January 2018 to David Martin Davies of Texas Public Radio, declared: "There is a large number of schools in Texas that don’t even offer sex education. Now that, to me, it’s bizarre. So we have to make these investments. If you really are serious about reducing the demand for abortion, there are some really simple ways to do that -- sex education and access to contraceptives." We wondered if a large number of Texas schools don’t offer sex education. After emailing White's campaign to ask how he reached his conclusion, we noticed that the Austin-based Texas Freedom Network, which describes itself as the state’s watchdog for monitoring far-right issues, estimated in 2017 that 25.1 percent of the state’s school districts in 2015-16 didn’t teach sex education in their secondary schools--when just 2 percent weren’t doing so in 2007-08, the group previously found. Broadly, the group’s February 2017 report states that in 2015-16, about eight in 10 Texas school districts taught abstinence alone "or nothing at all when it comes to sex education." Abstinence-plus programs, including information on contraceptives, showed up in nearly 17 percent of districts. The results were reached starting from a survey sent to 138 of 976 Texas school districts that had high schools that weren’t also charter school districts--plus the state’s 10 highest-enrollment districts. Districts were "representative of the diversity in geography, enrollment, racial demographics and district type (rural, urban or non-metropolitan/smaller cities) in Texas public schools," the report says. The report concedes that it didn’t pin down precisely what’s taught to students in each district. Rather, the group asked which textbooks, third-party programs or curricula and/or speakers that districts had obtained and/or used to teach sex education in middle and high schools. Also, the report says, "we asked specifically for materials districts had obtained from crisis pregnancy centers or other alternative-to-abortion organizations, any materials that cover sexual orientation, gender identity/expression or abortion, and copies of class schedules and district policies." To our inquiry, a network spokesman, Dan Quinn, listed the 35 sampled districts found not to be teaching sex education--nearly all of them rural. Health class in high schools Quinn also told us by email: "A key factor in the increase in the percentage of school districts not offering sex education appears to be the Legislature’s decision in 2009 to drop health class as a high school graduation requirement." The 2009 Legislature and then-Gov. Rick Perry advanced House Bill 3 into law. It directed the State Board of Education to spell out the classes students would have to pass to fulfill different kinds of graduation plans. Yet the law barred the board from specifying electives, such as health, as classes that had to be taken to graduate. Quinn wrote: "Health class is often where students get sex ed. Many school districts either continue to offer health as an elective or make it a local graduation requirement, but a substantial number of school districts appear to have dropped health classes since 2009." The network’s 2017 report states: "We found that districts with no health class were more than four times more likely to offer no sex education at all (as compared with the overall distribution of districts). Conversely, school districts with health classes were more likely to offer either abstinence-plus or abstinence-only sex education. This finding suggests that the decision to remove health education as a state graduation requirement has contributed to the rise in the percentage of districts that teach students nothing at all about human sexuality in high school," the report says. Health classes don’t necessarily cover sex education We further learned that just because a district offers a health class doesn’t mean its students take the class or that the class covers more than the state-required emphasis on abstinence alone as the best practice. The state’s curriculum guidelines for the one-semester health class call for students to analyze the "effectiveness and ineffectiveness of barrier protection and other contraceptive methods." They otherwise say each student is expected to analyze the importance of abstinence from sex as the only method that’s 100 percent effective in preventing pregnancy and sexually-transmitted diseases. But Lauren Callahan, a spokeswoman for the Texas Education Agency, cautioned against presuming the guidelines show what’s being taught because, she noted, that’s up to individual districts. State law requires each district board of trustees to establish a local school health advisory council to "assist the district in ensuring that local community values are reflected in the district's health education instruction." Also, the law says each board shall choose course materials related to sex education with the council’s advice. Notably too, not all students lately take health classes. Callahan pointed us to annual school health surveys undertaken by the agency. Per the latest results, nearly 52 percent of districts and charter schools in 2015-16 indicated they weren’t requiring all high school students to take "health education" to graduate--with 48 percent replying that they did require every student to take a class in health education. Study: Abstinence-plus instruction isn’t widespread The study estimated that 58 percent of districts offered abstinence-only sex education. In contrast, the study says, nearly 17 percent of districts were taking an abstinence-plus approach by having medically accurate information on condoms and other forms of contraception. Quinn noted that in 2007-08, the network previously found, about 4 percent of districts took an abstinence-plus approach. Quinn, asked to identify the districts in its 2017 sample that were found to have abstinence-plus teaching materials, listed 30 districts, including eight of the state’s 10 highest-enrollment districts--such as the Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth and Austin districts. But, Quinn wrote, determining "how those ab-plus materials are used in classrooms — whether teachers use them as suggested, skip portions, or whatever — was beyond the scope of this project." Similarly, David C. Wiley, a Texas State University education professor who worked on the study, told us by phone: "There’s no guarantee that teachers are actually teaching that information." Upshot: "Texas kids don’t get much information about contraception," Wiley said. As we completed this research, Desi Canela of White's campaign said by email that White reached his conclusion about schools not offering sex education based on the network's 2017 study. Our ruling White said a "large number" of Texas schools don’t offer sex education. In fact, most districts offered sex education in high school in 2015-16, according to a statewide analysis, though nearly 60 percent were teaching abstinence alone. The study estimated that 25 percent of districts didn't offer sex education. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-14244	"Hedge fund managers and others in private equity pay much lower (tax) rates on their income than do truck drivers and teachers and nurses."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/apr/13/tammy-baldwin/testing-tammy-baldwin-claim-taxes-hedge-fund-manag/	In a recent interview on WISN’s UpFront with Mike Gousha, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin talked about how the burden of college debt requires bipartisan action from Congress. "But we’re not going to wait around to start talking about the solutions," she said. Baldwin then cited legislation she has introduced to close the so-called "carried interest" loophole, which allows the primary source of income for hedge fund managers to be taxed differently than others earning a similar amount. "Hedge fund managers and others in private equity pay much lower (tax) rates on their income than do truck drivers and teachers and nurses," Baldwin said in the Feb. 14, 2016 interview. "Outrageous." Last May, PolitiFact National checked a similar claim from Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton: Hedge fund managers "pay less in taxes than nurses and truck drivers." The claim was rated False, since the raw amount paid in taxes by hedge fund managers far exceeds that paid by nurses and truck drivers. Similarly, the tax rates paid would typically be higher as well. Baldwin’s claim is very similar to the one from Clinton. Does Baldwin fare any better? Carried interest The carried interest provision Baldwin referred to concerns the compensation of investment managers. Hedge fund managers oversee money from investors and are compensated with a cut of the profits. Their paycheck is typically determined according to a "two and twenty" formula -- that is, a 2 percent fee for all assets invested and 20 percent of profits earned. The fee on profits, called carried interest, serves as investment manager’s main source of income. The 20 percent cut is taxed as capital gains, rather than normal earnings, so those funds are subject to a lower rate -- 20 percent with surtaxes of 3.8 and 1.2 percent. Carried interest also isn’t subject to payroll taxes. Meanwhile, the income of the wealthiest Americans is taxed at the highest rate -- nearly 40 percent. The issue: Many hedge fund managers would otherwise fall into this group. Baldwin’s legislation, termed the Carried Interest Fairness Act of 2015, would tax these earnings at ordinary income tax rates. For all the talk, carried interest represents a very small portion of all employee compensation in the United States. Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that ending the tax break would raise $1.32 billion this year and $15.64 billion over 10 years. This is just a drop in the bucket for the federal government, which collected about $1.5 trillion in income taxes in 2015. Baldwin’s claim We have checked a Baldwin claim about the tax break before. In September 2015, she said "the pope and Donald Trump and Tammy Baldwin all agree" on eliminating the "carried-interest" tax break. We rated the claim Half True. Trump, the Republican presidential front runner, does agree with Baldwin, but we could find no evidence of Pope Francis making a statement on ending the tax break. When we asked for backup for the claim that hedge fund managers pay "much lower" income tax rates than "truck drivers and teachers and nurses," Baldwin’s staff simply pointed to the "carried interest" tax break. So that’s our starting point. As noted, the hedge fund manager’s cut of profits is taxed at around 25 percent when surtaxes are included. The average truck driver, meanwhile, would fall into the 15 percent tax bracket, while a well-compensated one may be taxed at 25 percent. Based on IRS salary figures, most nurses and teachers would be taxed at 25 percent of their income. However, thanks to various exemptions, deductions and credits, nearly all people pay a lower average tax than their tax bracket suggests. So what’s the average tax rate for truck drivers, teachers and nurses? According to 2015 figures from the Joint Committee on Taxation, an individual making between $75,000 and $100,000 -- which would typically be a high-end salary for the cited occupations -- would pay an average tax rate of 6 percent. To be sure, a lot of variation exists in the taxes paid, so it is possible that some truck drivers (or teachers or nurses) may pay a higher average tax rate than a hedge fund manager. But Baldwin was speaking in a broad sense, and our analysis looks at it that way, too. "The truck driver will pay a lower percentage of income than will the hedge fund manager," said Roberton Williams of the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. "But the hedge fund manager pays a lot less tax than he or she would if the carried interest were considered income rather than capital gains." Indeed, the same Joint Committee on Taxation analysis found the highest earners -- people who make more than $500,000 a year and are taxed at nearly 40 percent on their last dollar earned -- typically face an average tax rate of 27.4 percent Of course, the hedge fund managers pay less, as previously noted, based on the nature of their income. Our rating Baldwin said "hedge fund managers and others in private equity pay much lower (tax) rates on their income than do truck drivers and teachers and nurses." Based on the carried interest provisions, there could be some individual scenarios in which a truck driver would pay a larger portion of income than a hedge fund manager. But when looking at average tax rates -- the amount typically paid after deductions and exemptions -- a typical truck driver, teacher or nurse would pay a far smaller percentage of their income in taxes. We rate the claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b299b6dd-d2b1-42dd-8a77-b502b5c6a581	None	Tammy Baldwin	None	None	None	2016-04-13T05:00:00	2016-02-14	['None']

pomt-14526	"The richest 80 people in the world own more wealth than the bottom half of the global population."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/feb/17/bernie-sanders/pretty-much-money-sanders-says-80-richest-own-more/	Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ campaign against economic inequality went global in a video for the One Campaign, a global AIDS and poverty advocacy group,. "The issue of wealth and income inequality is the great moral issue of our time," Sanders said. "It is the great economic issue of our time and the great political issue of our time. Truthfully, there is something profoundly wrong when the richest 80 people in the world own more wealth than the bottom half of the global population, 3.5 billion people." That’s an astounding fact, if true, that 80 people own as much wealth as 3.5 billion. We decided to see if Sanders was right. He largely is. Sanders relied on a 2014 analysis from Oxfam, which came up with the comparison from two different reports. The first, from Credit Suisse, estimated the distribution of household wealth worldwide. The second was Forbes’ list of billionaires. We'll walk you through the calculations and a couple of caveats. The Credit Suisse report Analysts hired by Credit Suisse estimated total personal wealth at $263 trillion. From there, analysts estimated that the bottom half of the world’s population (approximately 3.5 billion people) owned less than 1 percent of all wealth. To be precise, (and you can find this on page 110 of the full Credit Suisse databook) the bottom half of the world’s population own .72 percent of world household wealth, which comes out to about $1.7 trillion. James Davies, one of the report’s lead authors and an economist at the University of Western Ontario, said no one else has done this exact study. That’s true, but the Allianz Group, another global financial corporation, and the Boston Consulting Group, a financial and management consulting firm, have estimates of total household financial wealth that are pretty close to what Credit Suisse reported. Brent Beardsley, managing director at the Boston Consulting Group, told us both his firm and Credit Suisse used much of the same data, but Credit Suisse included more countries. Beardsley said that difference wouldn’t be significant. Raul Santaeulalia-Llopis, an economist at Washington University in St. Louis, said the Credit Suisse may have underestimated wealth in low-income countries. But even if true, it wouldn’t throw off Sanders’ comparison much. Santaeulalia-Llopis said Sanders and Oxfam might need to add a few more billionaires to their tally to make it more accurate. The strongest criticism of the Credit Suisse report is that it includes a significant number of people in wealthy countries who are not poor but have large debts. That produces misleading results, Beardsley said. "(They) are not actually living in poverty but simply have very low or even negative net worth due to amassment of debt to finance housing, education and consumption beyond current income," Beardsley said. "In this case, wealth -- or rather net worth -- is not an adequate measure of what is commonly understood as poverty." However, this doesn’t challenge the underlying numbers. Instead, it raises a question about interpreting them. Economist Branko Milanovic, formerly with the World Bank and now at City University of New York Graduate Center, countered in a blog post that sometimes, a negative net worth is a very big deal. "Even for those people in the rich world who are ‘anomalously’ placed among the wealth-poor and who may lead nice lives despite owning nothing, a shock in the form of a medical emergency -- unless there is public health care -- or loss of job may have catastrophic consequences," Milanovic wrote. "There is just no wealth to fall back on to tide you over the bad times." Forbes billionaire estimates The second half of the comparison is relatively straightforward. Oxfam used Forbes' list of billionaires and counted how many people it would take to reach $1.7 trillion -- the figure representing the wealth of the bottom half of the global population. Forbes' calculations aren't perfect, but they are the best estimate publicly available. Forbes tracks changes in real time, but the base comparisons depend on estimates generated by members of the Forbes team. Sometimes the billionaires themselves say the numbers are off because far from all the necessary information is public knowledge. Then there are fluctuations due to changing currency exchange rates and the ups and downs of the stock market. The list can’t deliver pinpoint accuracy, but it does represent a good faith effort to assess the net worth of the world’s wealthiest people. Like the wealth calculations in the Credit Suisse report, it should be seen as a reasonable estimate. One final note The divide between the super rich and the bottom of the global population appears to be getting worse. Credit Suisse, Forbes and Oxfam update their numbers at least every year and for 2015, Oxfam said just 62 billionaires own as much as half the world’s people combined. The Sanders campaign, however, told us the video was shot before the latest Oxfam report. So we won't hold it against Sanders in our rating. Our ruling Sanders said that 80 people own as much as half the world’s population. The statement was in line with the latest Oxfam report available at the time Sanders spoke. The Oxfam analysis was based on a report from Credit Suisse and the Forbes list of billionaires. The exact number of billionaires might well be different from the 80 that Sanders said, or the 62 that Oxfam said more recently. But out of world population of 7 billion, it makes little difference if the tally were 160. It still represents a tiny sliver of a percentage of the people in the world. The statement is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2016-02-17T16:29:38	2016-02-07	['None']
pomt-02840	Says Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has "blocked the Senate over 400 times."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/20/alison-lundergan-grimes/alison-lundergan-grimes-says-mitch-mcconnell-block/	Is Mitch McConnell the "guardian of gridlock"? One of the marquee races in the 2014 midterm elections is McConnell’s bid to win a sixth term representing Kentucky. And one of the issues likely to get significant attention in the campaign is whether McConnell, as the Senate’s minority leader, has unduly obstructed the Senate majority’s work. The allegation of obstructionism is at the center of an ad released in October by his Democratic challenger, Alison Lundergan Grimes. The ad shows a house slowly catching fire, as the narrator says, "He calls himself a proud guardian of gridlock. He’s blocked the Senate over 400 times, then voted to shut down the government, hurting Kentucky’s economy. Mitch McConnell can’t light the house on fire, then claim credit for putting it out, especially while it’s still burning." As evidence, the Grimes campaign cited a report by WFPL, the Louisville NPR affiliate, in July 2013. The radio report noted that "since 2007, Senate statistics show McConnell has used the filibuster 413 times as minority leader. That is almost twice as much as when Democrats held the minority from 1995 to 2001." The rules behind filibusters can get pretty wonky, but Grimes’ claim has sparked intense discussion concerning some highly technical rules of Senate debate. Our fact-checking colleagues at FactCheck.org and the Washington Post Fact Checker have looked into the claim, with FactCheck.org concluding that "Grimes uses inflated figures," and the Fact Checker giving the claim three Pinocchios out of a possible four. Meanwhile, political scientists pushed back, saying Grimes’ claim had merit. We decided to take a fresh look at the evidence. The finer points of Senate procedure Under the Senate’s rules, action on legislation can proceed one of two ways. The smoother path, if it can be achieved, is through unanimous consent of all senators on the terms of a debate. But, as the term "unanimous" indicates, this standard means that any senator who wishes to can block consent. The alternative is to file a "cloture motion." If it passes, then debate on the underlying legislation can proceed. If it fails, Senate action remains stalled. A cloture motion must secure a supermajority -- 60 votes. Because rounding up 60 votes is no easy task, the Senate’s minority party -- and indeed any individual senator in either party -- can wield significant influence by slowing or stopping action, simply by objecting, either publicly or behind the scenes. The claim in Grimes’ ad, that McConnell blocked the Senate 400 times, counts almost every time a cloture motion was filed between 2007 and 2013. But skeptics have pointed out that, in some of those cases, cloture was approved, meaning that the blockage was ultimately overcome. In other cases, cloture requests were withdrawn, meaning the parties managed to work out an agreement to proceed. And in some cases, it was McConnell who filed cloture to end a Democratic blockage, a move that shouldn’t be considered part of McConnell’s efforts to block action. After weeding out these instances, both Factcheck.org and the Fact Checker settled on 120 cases in which the chamber voted on cloture but failed to approve it. That’s a lot less than 400. McConnell’s office agrees with this interpretation. "As a matter of a fact check, your job is simple," McConnell spokesman Don Stewart told PolitiFact. "Did McConnell block the Senate ‘over 400 times’ or not? That’s an easy one: No." The Grimes campaign acknowledged that there are other reasonable interpretations of the data, but said it stands by the ad. Other ways to define obstructionism Experts on congressional procedure told PolitiFact that counting only 120 cloture votes doesn't fully encapsulate the extent of blocking undertaken by McConnell or the conference he leads. Part of the uncertainty stems from the definition of the word Grimes used: "block." If blocking means a maneuver that permanently prevents something from happening, then 120 examples would seem to be the right call. But if blocking means a delaying action, sometimes for months or years at a time, then the number of cloture motions filed -- roughly 400 -- begins to look much more defensible. When counting the number of cloture motions filed, rather than just those voted down, "the sequence of events suggests that the majority tried to move forward but couldn't because they were blocked by the minority," said Sarah Binder, a congressional scholar at the Brookings Institution. "So the majority filed for cloture, and then the minority came to the table. You just can't drop those from the count. McConnell, with support of his party, effectively blocked the Senate, at least temporarily." Binder offered two examples to illustrate the larger phenomenon. In the first case, Barbara Keenan, a judicial nominee, had to wait four months for a confirmation vote due to GOP opposition. After Reid filed for cloture, the Senate approved cloture by a 98-0 margin. "Yes, cloture was invoked, but GOP obstruction delayed seating a judge for four months," Binder said. Binder’s second example is Richard Cordray, President Barack Obama’s nominee to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Cordray waited almost two years for a vote; one finally came in July 2013, when cloture was approved, 71-29. "How can you say there was no effort to block the Senate from confirming Corday?" Binder said. "The minority tried to block him and they failed." Binder sees the Keenan and Cordray cases as "examples of a more general phenomenon." Other congressional scholars agreed. "Looking only at things actually killed by failed cloture motions is the narrowest way to look at the impact of filibusters and threatened filibusters," said Norm Ornstein, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. "Instances of filibusters invoked on bills and nominations that passed unanimously or nearly so are done to soak up huge amounts of the Senate's most precious commodity, time. I view those actions as blockage." Steven Smith, a congressional scholar at Washington University in St. Louis, thinks the more expansive definition of what counts as "blocking" has merit, because delays aren’t cost-free. "Agencies that go without leadership, courts struggling with large workloads, departments without regular appropriations, and many, many other consequences of delay cannot be dismissed as inconsequential," he said. In fact, if you use the broader definition of "block" -- and throw in examples of the minority using amendments, motions, extraneous debate and roll-call vote demands -- then the number 400 could actually underestimate the amount of blocking going on. How much is McConnell to blame? Another tricky issue is whether the obstruction can be pinned on McConnell personally. Most experts we checked with said both parties bear some responsibility for the current paralysis in the Senate -- both due to Democratic actions prior to 2007 (when their party was in the minority) and current actions by the Democratic majority that have minimized the GOP’s ability to offer amendments. In addition, each senator is individually empowered to block whatever legislation they wish, so some of the blocking is being driven by individual senators rather than McConnell specifically. Still, the experts agreed that just because McConnell shares the responsibility doesn’t mean he’s absolved of all responsibility. After all, he’s been the GOP leader since 2007 and once said, "The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president." Binder believes that as the party’s leader and chief Senate strategist, "it’s reasonable to hold him accountable for party-backed filibusters." "If an observer can't see that this is central to McConnell's style of leadership, then it's time to find another line of work," said Roy T. Meyers, a political scientist at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County who specializes in Congress. Our ruling In her ad, Grimes said that McConnell has "blocked the Senate over 400 times." If you look at cases of permanent blockage -- which you can do by counting failed cloture votes -- then Grimes’ number significantly exaggerates the scale of McConnell’s obstructionism. But her 400 figure sounds much more reasonable if one uses a broader definition of "block" that counts delays, many of which have gone on for months and even years. In fact, there are enough ways for a minority to gum up the works that aren’t counted in the statistics that the actual number of blockages -- if it could be divined -- could well push the number higher than 400. And that’s a key problem for Grimes -- the number can’t be divined, meaning that Grimes’ figure, even if it is actually a low estimate, communicates a false sense of statistical specificity. It’s also debatable how much McConnell deserves blame for the Senate’s current gridlock, though most experts say he at least deserves some. On balance, we rate Grimes’ claim Half True.

pomt-10203	"I fought to bring about the largest private-sector infrastructure project in North American history."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/15/sarah-palin/not-quite-the-largest-and-not-quite-brought-about/	Since Sen. John McCain named Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin his vice-presidential running mate, she has repeatedly touted her push for a new pipeline in Alaska as evidence of her executive experience and energy expertise. But she has often fudged the truth in the process, as we explain in this article . Here we'll look at a claim Palin made both in her speech at the Republican National Convention on Sept. 3, 2008, and in a radio address three days later. Here's the full context, from the radio address: "Despite fierce opposition from oil company lobbyists, we broke their monopoly on power and resources," Palin said. "As governor, I insisted on competition and basic fairness to end their control of our state and return it to the people. I fought to bring about the largest private-sector infrastructure project in North American history. And when that deal was struck, we began a nearly $40-billion natural gas pipeline to help lead America to energy independence." The pipeline, which has been a pipe dream (pardon us) of officials and oilmen in Alaska for three decades, would carry to market natural gas currently stranded under the state's remote and rugged North Slope. Palin's plan is for the Canadian company TransCanada Corp. to build a 1,715-mile line southeast along the Alaska Highway, through the Canadian province of British Columbia to a hub in Alberta. Before her election as governor, Palin opposed the idea of routing the pipeline through Canada, a version of which her predecessor, Frank Murkowski, had advocated. But after she was elected governor she decided to consider all options. She pushed the Legislature to pass a law providing $500-million in state funds to whatever company presented the best proposal for the project. The Legislature accepted TransCanada's proposal in August 2008, and the company now faces the multiyear process of seeking federal approval. So yes, Palin "fought to bring about" a new plan for the pipeline. (Though she also fought to put the kibosh on Murkowski's plan.) Her phrasing — "fought to bring about" — could suggest that she did bring about the pipeline — that is, that it has been built, or is at least under construction. That's not true — TransCanada does not plan to begin construction until 2015, if at all. Now, would the pipeline be "the largest private-sector infrastructure project in North American history"? Palin didn't specify what she meant by "largest," but according to engineering experts, cost is the most common measure of the size of large-scale projects. "Generally when people talk about the size of an infrastructure project they're talking about the cost," said Jay McCauley, vice president of the Society for Industrial Archeology. We talked to several experts in pipelines and large-scale engineering projects, who said the only private infrastructure project on the scale of Palin's proposed pipeline that they could come up with was the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, an oil pipeline also from the North Slope that is often referred to as the Alaska Pipeline. (Most large infrastructure projects are publicly funded, whether directly, like the Interstate Highway System, or indirectly, like the Transcontinental Railroad.) The Alaska Pipeline was completed in 1977 at a cost of $8-billion. At 800 miles, it is physically shorter than TransCanada's proposed pipeline, but its $8-billion price tag would be at least $27-billion in 2007 dollars, according to the three online inflation calculators we consulted. Palin has claimed repeatedly that TransCanada's pipeline would cost "nearly $40-billion." But we could not determine where that estimate came from, and neither Palin's office in Alaska nor the McCain campaign returned our calls to tell us. Alaska's Web site says TransCanada's project would cost about $26-billion, and TransCanada spokeswoman Cecily Dobson confirmed the cost estimate remains "approximately US$26-billion in 2007 dollars." That's less than the $27-billion inflation-adjusted cost of the Alaska Pipeline. Not by much — but it's less. Palin was right to say she "fought to bring about" the pipeline. But she implies that it's further along than it really is. And she was wrong — though not egregiously so — to say it would be the largest private-sector infrastructure project in North American history. We judge her claim to be Half True.

pomt-07802	"One of the biggest causes of our soaring debt and economic insecurity ends up being Pentagon spending. The budget for the Pentagon consumes more than half of our discretionary spending."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/feb/18/dennis-kucinich/rep-dennis-kucinich-says-defense-spending-consumes/	President Obama submitted his 2012 budget proposal to Congress on Valentine's Day, but the debate on efforts to cut spending started weeks earlier. Rep. Dennis Kucinich opened it with a call to question the cost of wars. "We can have a strong defense, but we are spending so much money that we are undermining our ability to be able to provide for the American people here at home," he said. "One of the biggest causes of our soaring debt and economic insecurity ends up being Pentagon spending. The budget for the Pentagon consumes more than half of our discretionary spending." PolitiFact Ohio wondered about that and took a closer look. We turned to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and to the National Priorities Project, a nonpartisan, liberal-leaning think tank that analyzes data to show how tax dollars are spent. The federal budget has two types of spending, discretionary and mandatory. Mandatory spending, also called direct spending, refers to outlays required by law. It includes such entitlement programs as Social Security and Medicare, veterans' benefits, food stamps, education and health programs. Mandatory spending is about two-thirds of the total budget. The problem of dealing with the politically charged entitlements is why balancing the budget is so difficult. Discretionary spending is the part of the budget governed by the annual appropriation process and debated by Congress. That category includes "defense" (which does not include all military-related spending), security, agricultural subsidies, education, health programs, highway construction and housing assistance. Discretionary defense outlays in fiscal 2010, which ended in October, were $689 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Non-defense outlays were $677 billion, or less than half the total. For fiscal 2011, the CBO projects an even larger percentage of the discretionary budget -- 58 percent -- is military. Discretionary spending on the military has been trending up for more than a decade. From 2001 to 2010, it increased by 71 percent -- almost three times the rate of increase in domestic discretionary spending, which rose about 24 percent. Nonsecurity-related discretionary spending accounts for only about 15 percent of the $3.5 trillion total budget. We leave the question of whether that’s good policy for others to debate. But as to Kucinich’s statement, we rate his claim as True.	None	Dennis Kucinich	None	None	None	2011-02-18T06:00:00	2011-01-24	['The_Pentagon']
pomt-00162	John Adcock and Republicans’ plan for health care "would get rid of coverage altogether for thousands of families and raise premiums on the rest of us."	false	/north-carolina/statements/2018/oct/23/sydney-batch/democrat-falsely-links-newly-appointed-republican-/	Democrats in North Carolina are campaigning on the idea that the GOP-controlled legislature should do more to improve health care in North Carolina. A recent video ad by Sydney Batch, a Democrat running for NC House District 37 in southern Wake County, tries to build off that idea. She’s running against Republican John Adcock, who was appointed to the seat in September. "John Adcock wants to join politicians who took thousands from insurance companies and support letting them deny health care coverage," a narrator in the ad says. "Their plan would get rid of coverage altogether for thousands of families and raise premiums on the rest of us." The claims are vague, leaving PolitiFact to wonder which plan by legislative Republicans would eliminate coverage for North Carolina families. The first quote is a reference to Republicans refusing to expand Medicaid, said Benjamin Woods, Batch’s campaign manager. It’s been well-documented that expanding Medicaid in North Carolina could provide coverage for up to 500,000 people. So let’s move on to the second quote. Woods said it refers to legislative Republicans’ "work to undermine the positive impact of the Affordable Care Act in North Carolina." Woods referenced a Charlotte Observer editorial about a Republican proposal this summer that would allow nonprofit organizations to offer health benefits to their members. An alternative to the ACA Health benefit plans, which exist in other states but aren’t available in North Carolina, can be cheaper than typical health insurance because they’re not regulated and don’t have to meet financial solvency requirements for sufficient funds to pay customers’ medical bills, The News & Observer reported in June. The plans don’t cover mental health benefits or preventive health services, unlike health insurance regulated under the ACA. (Although, in some cases, customers can pay extra for that coverage.) Critics, including The Charlotte Observer editorial board, fear the nonprofit benefit plans would lure healthy customers away from ACA plans, "which in turn would force insurers to raise premiums even more to cover the costs of the less healthy folks and elderly who remain on Obamacare." The Observer’s editorial continued: "The result: Obamacare will be gutted. So will its preexisting conditions benefit." The bill’s intention is indeed to provide healthy North Carolinians an alternative to subsidizing insurance for unhealthy people, said David Anderson, a research associate for Duke University’s Margolis Center for Health Policy. "It’s a cynical dodge, but a legal one," Anderson said. And it "would harm a small group of families who have significant medical conditions." The plan and Adcock The bill wouldn’t directly eliminate coverage, as the ad suggests. But it could drive up prices for ACA customers, prompting customers with the highest premiums to leave the marketplace altogether. "You’d probably start seeing price changes if 10,000 to 20,000 (healthy ACA customers) leave the risk pool," Anderson said. Eventually, he said, people with pre-existing conditions and the poor "will have to make the decision between paying the mortgage and paying for insurance." The bill, however, never became law. And Adcock hasn’t expressed support for it. In an email to PolitiFact, Adcock said he doesn’t know the specifics of the bill. But, "I know that many Republicans in the State House had many concerns with this bill as written, and I agree with them that the bill in its current form should not pass. "I think that if non-profit organizations want to offer health insurance to their members, they should be bound by consumer protections and have to cover all of their members, regardless of pre-existing conditions," Adcock continued. "While I’m open to considering a bill authorizing self-funded health benefit plans for non-profit organizations, I would need to review an extensive and objective analysis of its impacts before I could determine if such a bill is in the best interest of my constituents." Our ruling Batch’s commercial suggests a plan supported by John Adcock and legislative Republicans "would get rid of coverage altogether for thousands of families and raise premiums on the rest of us." Her campaign manager cited a bill that would have provided an alternative option to the Affordable Care Act. While that bill could ultimately destabilize the ACA marketplace, causing premiums to rise, it doesn’t directly eliminate coverage. It didn’t have enough support to pass and Adcock says he opposes it. We rate this claim False.

pomt-11430	In Japan, "they take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air and they drop it on the hood of the car. And if the hood dents, then the car doesn't qualify...It's horrible, the way we're treated."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/15/donald-trump/trump-botches-japanese-bowling-ball-test/	President Donald Trump often speaks of how other countries treat American products unfairly. At a private fundraising event in Missouri, Trump singled out a particular practice in Japan. "It's called the bowling ball test. Do you know what that is?" Trump said, according to a recording obtained by the Washington Post. "That's where they take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air, and they drop it on the hood of the car. And if the hood dents, then the car doesn't qualify. Well, guess what, the roof dented a little bit, and they said, nope, this car doesn't qualify. It's horrible, the way we're treated. It's horrible." The Washington Post noted, "It was unclear what he was talking about." So we wanted to look into it. We asked the White House press office what Trump had in mind and got no comment. In her regular press briefing, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump was just joking. However, we found something that loosely fits what he described. There are no bowling balls, and no 20-foot drop. But Japan’s National Agency for Automotive Safety and Victim Aid does what’s called a pedestrian head protection performance test. It’s designed to measure the force someone’s head would absorb if a car hit them. This involves firing a carefully calibrated hemisphere-shaped device (so, more like half of a bowling ball) at the hood and windshield. The device records the force. Here’s a graphic from the agency’s website: Note that the largest head impactor is 4.5 kilograms, or about 10 pounds. So, the details about a bowling ball, the weight and the height of the drop are all wrong. But those details aside, Trump also got the purpose and nature of the test totally wrong. When he said, "If the hood dents, then the car doesn't qualify," that would be a test of the strength of the hood. In contrast, the test is all about a person’s head and the force it has to absorb in an accident. "It’s the complete opposite," said Sean Kane, president of Safety Research and Strategy, a private firm that studies vehicle and consumer product safety. In fact, the more a hood dents or flexes, the better it is for the head of the unlucky pedestrian. "It’s akin to any other type of crash," Kane said. "You look at cars today, and the impact damage to cars is much greater. There’s a lot of crush, but that’s to absorb the energy and keep it away from people." A biomedical engineering dissertation from Wayne State University made the same point: "To lower head injury criterion, two main principles are necessary: provision of sufficient deformation space and provision of a low stiffness of the impacted vehicle body parts." However, Trump got one element correct. American cars sold in Japan, at least all models made this decade, have to meet the Japanese safety standard. So Trump was correct that this is a hurdle for American car makers. It’s worth noting that Europe has a similar standard. In the early 2000s, the problem of cars hitting pedestrians was worse in Europe and Japan than in the United States. In Japan, for example, 27 percent of all traffic fatalities were pedestrians hit by cars. In the United States, it was 13 percent. "The head impact test is a standardized test and has been there for many years," said Pankaj Mallick, professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. "Our car companies are very much aware of this, but at this time, there are no National Highway Traffic Safety Administration requirements to do this test for qualification of a car hood." Kane noted that the United States stands out for having lower safety standards than Europe and Japan. "If U.S. car makers wanted to make safer cars, they could sell them in both markets," he said. "If they don’t, that’s a business decision." Our ruling Trump said that in Japan, "they take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air and they drop it on the hood of the car. And if the hood dents, then the car doesn't qualify." American cars must meet a Japanese standard. But Trump mangled the highly controlled process, which does not involve a bowling ball dropped from 20 feet. Where Trump really goes astray is on the purpose of the test; he has it backward. It’s not about seeing if the hood is strong. The more a hood gives way, the better it is for the head of a pedestrian. Trump’s understanding of the test is so far off the mark, we rate this claim False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2018-03-15T17:41:13	2018-03-14	['Japan']

"Just in: actor ‘Vin Deisel’ (sic) dies after a failed attempt to perfect a stunt on set," reads a headline of an article on the website thth.mayatmenen.info. That sounds sadder than the death of Groot. But did it really happen? The article is a pitch-black void of evidence to suggest that Diesel died. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Figuring out the facts of this story was less complicated than the plot of XXX. For starters, Diesel’s name is spelled incorrectly in the headline. It’s also notable that there’s no byline for the article. Reputable news stories usually come with a byline to keep writers accountable and allow readers to contact the author if necessary. Below the headline, there are two paragraphs lifted, word-for-word, from Vin Diesel’s Wikipedia page. The page also contains a video clip featuring a Fox News logo and a newscaster. Clicking on it, you’d expect to hear a news anchor reporting on the news of Vin Diesel’s death. But if you click on the video, you’ll actually hear the anchor say, "Finally, I have some very sad news," before the clip freezes and is replaced by the words "Share to Uncover This Video." Clicking on those words opens up a pop-up window that allows you to share a link to the article on Facebook. We found after we shared the story, the video still would not load. A Nexis search revealed that no major news outlets have reported on Diesel’s death, and no obituaries have been written for him. This isn’t the first time that incorrect rumors of Diesel’s death have spread like the Necromongers across the galaxy. The hoax occurred at least one other time, in 2014. We were unable to get in touch with the website where the article was posted, as we could not find any contact information for them. Our ruling A story on a website, thth.mayatmenen.info, claims that actor Vin Diesel died "after a failed attempt to perfect a stunt on set."

pomt-03438	Says Georgia Power customers pay 10 percent to 15 percent below the national average for electricity.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/jun/24/ron-shipman/georgia-power-customers-pay-lower-rates-most-offic/	So, do Georgia Power customers pay less for their services than people in other parts of the country? The answer is yes, a company official said at a June 10 community meeting. How much less? Ten percent to 15 percent below the national average, said Ron Shipman, the company’s vice president of environmental affairs. PolitiFact Georgia heard about the claim and decided to do some research. Georgia Power has nearly 2.4 million customers. That’s about one out of every three adults in this state. The Partnership for Southern Equity, an organization that tries to help the working poor in metro Atlanta, put together the meeting. The crux of the meeting was that there ends up being a lot of inequity in the communities when it comes to utility bills. Some low-income Atlanta-area residents live in older homes that are not energy-efficient, thus, their utility bills are super high. Company officials at the meeting stressed that there are programs to help those people. In general, the company contended at the meeting, their service is less expensive in comparison to other parts of the country. We found the company has been below the national average, but by how much? Georgia Power, a subsidiary of Atlanta-based Southern Co., is regulated by the state’s Public Service Commission. It gets 47 percent of its fuel from natural gas; 35 percent from coal; 18 percent from nuclear; and a small amount from hydropower and other renewable sources. As a regulated monopoly, Georgia Power must provide electricity to all customers in its territory. It is allowed to recoup the costs of providing that power plus a profit. The average bill was expected to increase by 44 cents a month in January. Georgia Power credits programs such as free in-home energy audits for residential customers plus others that assist commercial customers in installing energy-efficient equipment in their facilities for lower costs than most utilities. The company also recently introduced My Power Usage – an online program that allows residential customers to track their daily energy costs, view their projected bill, set up email notifications about their usage and more, company spokesman Jacob Hawkins said. Georgia Power bases its claim on how much it charges customers for its services, Hawkins said. In 2012, Georgia Power customers paid about 9 cents per kilowatt hour. The national average, he said, was 10.13 cents per kilowatt hours. The difference was about 11 percent. The federal government has an agency that keeps track of how much money Americans pay for energy use, the U.S. Energy Information Administration. EIA data are used by other organizations, such as the Edison Electric Institute, an 80-year-old organization of U.S. shareholder-owned electric companies. The EIA figures we found for Georgia Power customers in 2012 were nearly identical to what the company sent us. The national average in 2012 was slightly lower, 9.865 cents per kilowatt hour. Thus, Georgia Power customers paid 8.7 percent less than the national average, according to our analysis of 2012 data. In 2011, we found Georgia Power customers paid 2.9 percent below the national average. Before 2011, Georgia Power customers paid 10 percent less than the national average eight consecutive years. They paid more than 15 percent below the national average in five of those years. Georgia Power officials sent us their own figures, saying it’s not an "apples to apples" comparison to include every utility company in the nation. The company shared a comparison that focused solely on investor-owned utilities. Georgia Power’s numbers showed its customers paid 10 percent or more below the national average in nine of the past 10 years. In 2011, Georgia Power customers paid 5.1 percent below the national average. To sum up, Georgia Power official Ron Shipman said the company’s customers pay 10 percent to 15 percent below the national average. Our findings showed Shipman’s numbers were off the past two years but on point for the prior eight years. Georgia Power’s research was fairly similar. Since he was slightly off for 2012, but right for eight of the nine years before that, we rate Shipman’s claim as Mostly True.	None	Ron Shipman	None	None	None	2013-06-24T00:00:00	2013-06-10	['None']

pomt-01624	"Cory Gardner is sponsoring a bill to ban all abortions right now."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/28/democratic-senatorial-campaign-committee/democratic-group-claims-cory-gardner-backs-bill-ba/	Rep. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., who’s running to unseat Democratic Sen. Mark Udall, is finding his stance on abortion targeted by another Democratic attack ad. We previously rated a Udall claim that Gardner "championed" an effort to ban birth control in Colorado as Half True. The latest 30-second spot, aired by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, features a handful of women criticizing the Colorado Republican’s pro-life stance. "Why do guys like Cory Gardner think it’s any of their business to tell women what do?" one woman asks. Another calls Gardner’s positions "extreme," after a narrator says Gardner would "ban abortions even in cases of rape and incest." Later, the narrator adds: "Gardner is sponsoring a bill to ban all abortions right now." We decided to take a look at this last claim. The DSCC points to H.R. 1091, known formally as the Life At Conception Act and informally as a "personhood" bill. Gardner is listed as a cosponsor on the bill. The bill was introduced April 8, 2013, by Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. According to the bill text, it would "implement equal protection for the right to life of each born and preborn human person" and "declares that the right to life guaranteed by the Constitution is vested in each human being." It goes on to say that "‘human person’ and ‘human being’ include each and every member of the species homo sapiens at all stages of life, including the moment of fertilization, cloning, or other moment at which an individual member of the human species comes into being." If this sounds confusing to you, that’s because it is. None of the above mentions abortion, even though it’s quite clearly an anti-abortion measure. In fact, the only part of the bill that seems to directly reference abortion only further muddies the waters: "Nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize the prosecution of any woman for the death of her unborn child." It’s difficult to weigh the impact of such a perplexing bill. On the one hand, the bill doesn’t explicitly carve out exemptions for cases that involve rape or incest or instances when the woman’s life or health is in danger. On the other hand, the bill doesn’t explicitly mention abortion in the first place. This means that judicial interpretation will play a big role in how any such law is implemented. But because no state has passed a personhood bill, courts have not established a track record about how they would interpret such a measure and how the measure would affect abortions. By suggesting that a fetus has the "right to life," the bill challenges the Supreme Court’s past support for a constitutional right to abortion. An act of Congress cannot overrule the constitution, meaning the Supreme Court would have to change its past positions on abortion. That’s possible, but even if the bill is a vehicle to challenge Roe vs. Wade and subsequent decisions, it’s not clear that the outcome would "ban all abortions." Glenn Cohen, codirector of the Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology and Bioethics at Harvard University, said claiming that the personhood bill would ban all abortions "might be a bit strong." Depending on how courts rule, it might still be possible that exceptions could be made in cases where the mother’s life or health was at risk, he said. "One could believe that fetuses are persons but still have those exceptions on a theory like self defense," Cohen said. Further complicating matters is that Gardner is straddling both sides of the issue. He has publicly stated that he no longer supports the personhood movement because of its potential affect on some FDA-approved birth control -- yet he has not taken his name off the bill as a cosponsor. Gardner’s campaign said his cosponsorship of the legislation is to "reflect his belief that life begins at conception." The campaign said Gardner is on record supporting exemptions for "rape, incest, and life of the mother," and the campaign disagrees that the personhood bill amounts to a ban on all abortion. The bill is not expected to come up for a vote. Gardner is cosponsor of a different bill filed in 2013 that would take away federal funding for abortion providers except when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest or a physician certifies that the woman's life is in danger if she carries the baby to birth. Our ruling The DSCC said Gardner "is sponsoring a bill to ban all abortions right now." The claim is based on Gardner’s cosponsorship of a bill that grants a fetus the same rights as a person from the moment of fertilization. It’s clear that such personhood bills are anti-abortion measures, but there’s a lot of uncertainty in the bill’s language that would have to be sorted through, over time, by the court system, and it’s not clear that it would ban all abortions. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee	None	None	None	2014-08-28T13:43:55	2014-08-21	['None']
pomt-01228	Austin mayoral candidate Steve Adler has "never been active in anything that has to do with City Hall."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2014/nov/20/mike-martinez/martinez-says-steve-adler-hasnt-been-active-anythi/	Austin mayoral candidate Mike Martinez says his opponent, Steve Adler, lacks experience in municipal matters. Martinez, an Austin City Council member since 2006, told Austin’s KVUE-TV for a news story aired Nov. 11, 2014: "He’s never been active in anything that has to do with City Hall," stressing "anything." Adler and Martinez are vying in a Dec. 16, 2014, runoff. Adler’s campaign manager, Jim Wick, asked us to look into Martinez’s claim. Asked how Martinez reached his conclusion, Martinez spokesman Nick Hudson emailed: "Mike meant something specific when he made this statement. While Mike Martinez has been on the Austin City Council for nearly eight years and has a near-perfect attendance record, Steve Adler has not, to our knowledge, ever taken an active role in our local government by appearing before Council on an item." That’s a way to get to "never." To be sure, Adler has been running as a City Hall outsider eager to get city government moving in a fresh direction. Wick told us Adler never has been on a council-appointed board or commission. But Wick said by email the eminent-domain lawyer has built familiarity with city affairs, in part by representing clients whose land was being condemned by the city. In 2004, Adler represented Lowe’s when the store and city of Austin tried to keep construction of a store continuing in Southwest Austin. The project ultimately proceeded after a 2005 legal settlement involving the city of Sunset Valley and environmental groups. Adler also has volunteered in causes that connected with city government, Wick wrote. According to an October 2014 Austin American-Statesman profile, Adler led the board of the Austin-area Anti-Defamation League from 2009 to 2012. In that role, Wick told us, Adler "helped conceive of and serves on the city-led Hate Crimes Task Force." The Austin ADL says on a web page that when the task force was launched in December 2010, its "convenors" included the ADL, several council members and more than 70 individuals representing 40 organizations or departments. A May 2011 Austin Chronicle news story, pointed out by Wick, listed the ADL among groups having a hand in starting the task force. The story described Laura Morrison as one of three council members behind the task force’s creation in the wake of the beatings of two men outside City Hall in 2010. "The attack prompted Morrison and colleagues Sheryl Cole and Randi Shade to ask the Austin chapter of the Anti-Defam­a­tion League to put together a proposal for what a city-led task force might look like," the Chronicle said. The story said: "The idea is for the group – which includes" Travis County’s district and county attorneys, the Austin Police Department, "University of Texas and Austin Independent School District police, members of the Anti-Defam­ation League, Out Youth, and other civil rights groups, among others – to identify and develop an approach to dealing with hate-motivated violence ‘before, during, and after’ it happens." That story didn’t mention Adler. But in May 2014, an Adler profile in the Austin Bulldog quoted Austin ADL board member Kirk Rudy saying Adler "was instrumental" in creating the task force. By phone, attorney Karen Gross, a former ADL staff member, told us she and Adler helped launch the task force by reaching out to any group with a possible stake in the collaboration of city, county and non-governmental entities. Wick said Adler also had a hand in writing the city’s cultural master plan. An April 2008 consultant’s report lists Adler among 71 members of the CreateAustin Leadership Council, an appointed group of "civic, business and cultural leaders who agreed to provide the visible leadership in reaching out to engage the community, to assist in crafting the CreateAustin Cultural Master Plan and to galvanize the effort to implement the plan’s recommendations." By telephone, Janet Seibert, the city’s civic arts program consultant, said the members were chosen by city staff. The report says the city’s Cultural Arts Division launched the CreateAustin "strategic planning process" in September 2006 because the city "wanted to review and refine municipal roles and responsibilities for cultural support, but that was only half of it. The City recognized they couldn’t support arts, culture and creative industries alone. They sought to trigger and develop community leadership to explore major issues and develop strategies to sustain the creative culture of Austin." The leadership council, the report said, "met regularly to review research, findings and community input in order to help shape the cultural plan." Adler, the report says, was on the body’s Cultural Infrastructure task force. Adler co-chaired that task force, Seiberg said to our query. She said the Austin City Council accepted the master plan in June 2010. Our ruling Martinez said Adler has "never been active in anything that has to do with City Hall." Adler hasn’t been a member of city boards or commissions and we accept Martinez’s assertion Adler hasn’t addressed the council. Then again, Adler had a leadership hand in developing the hate crimes task force and the city’s cultural master plan. All told, this never/anything statement strikes us as incorrect and ridiculous.

pomt-01413	"20,000 Kansans lost their health insurance because of (Obamacare)."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/09/pat-roberts/pat-roberts-obamacare-killed-insurance-20000-kansa/	In an unexpectedly tight race, Republican Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas is doing everything he can to paint his opponent -- independent Greg Orman -- as a liberal henchman. One of Roberts’ favorite points is Orman’s stance on the Affordable Care Act. Orman says he does not support the health care law, but he also says pushing legislation to repeal it is impractical, because President Barack Obama would simply veto it. In a recent Web video, Roberts treats that view as support for Obamacare. The ad starts out with video of Orman shaking hands with constituents, one of whom asks him a question about repealing Obamacare. Orman replies, "That’s an interesting question," and moves on down the line. "Greg Orman won't repeal Obamacare," the ad’s narrator says, "even though 20,000 Kansans lost their health insurance because of it." Roberts was expected to easily win a fourth term (the last time Kansas elected a Democrat to the Senate was in 1932). Then, Democratic candidate Chad Taylor dropped out, and independent Orman surged in the polls. Now the race is a toss-up. Some see a Roberts win as necessary for Republican Senate control in 2015. Both candidates say they do not support Obama’s health care law, but we wanted to know how the law had affected Kansas -- did 20,000 people really lose their health insurance? The answer, it seems, is no. How many Kansans lost insurance? We asked Linda Sheppard, health policy adviser for the Kansas Insurance Department, how many Kansans had lost their insurance due to Obamacare. She said the state does not require health insurance carriers to report when people go on or off coverage, so there’s no way to definitively know the answer. However, Sheppard said insurance carriers do have to check in with the department when they decide to terminate a policy. So 20,000 people losing health insurance would have likely come to her attention. "We are not aware of any wide-scale cancellation of policies," she said. Here’s what happened. About a year ago, in October 2013, Kansas’ largest insurance carrier -- Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas -- sent letters to about 9,450 policyholders, according to numerous news reports. Those members would be unable to renew their plans for 2014 because those plans do not comply with new standards under the Affordable Care Act. Sheppard told us there are no official numbers for how many people received these notices from insurance carriers other than Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas. Roberts’ ad cites the 20,000 figure from an October 2013 story out of Kansas Watchdog, a conservative news website. That story says Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City (which is primarily based in Missouri but also serves two Kansas counties) sent out notices to about 10,000 Kansan policyholders, on top of the 9,450 from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas. For Roberts, this is where the story ends. But in reality, the thousands of people who received these letters did not end up without insurance. The following November -- after the failed roll out of HealthCare.gov (Kansas uses the federal marketplace) -- Obama announced that people who had recieved these nonrenewal notices could keep their policies through 2014. Then in March of this year, Kansas agreed to another transitional policy that allowed all of these policies to continue through 2016. It’s Sheppard’s understanding that Kansas insurance companies turned around and retracted those nonrenewal notices -- meaning the thousands of people who received those notices were able to keep their health insurance. Retracting the nonrenewal notices caused some behind-the-scenes challenges for the carriers, but "for the consumer it was pretty easy," said Scott Brunner, senior analyst at the Kansas Health Institute, a nonprofit think tank. Of course, these policyholders could have chosen not to renew. They could have picked a different plan, switched to a different provider or dropped insurance altogether -- but they were not forced out of health insurance by the Affordable Care Act. "It is disingenuous to focus on those who lost insurance without acknowledging that it doesn’t mean they are currently (uninsured)," said Roberta Riportella, a professor of community health at Kansas State University who supports the Affordable Care Act. Roberts’ ad also ignores that the number of uninsured Kansans who have gained coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Because the state does not meticulously track the number of insured folks, and the law only became fully implemented this year, it is hard to know with certainty how many people gained insurance as a result of Obamacare. But about 57,000 Kansans are now enrolled in the health insurance marketplace, Riportella said. If Kansas follows national estimates, then roughly half of those people were previously uninsured. There’s no evidence to suggest that more people are uninsured now than before the Affordable Care Act was implemented, Brunner said. "The expectation would be that with the Affordable Care Act that the number would continue to decline," he said. Our ruling Roberts said, "20,000 Kansans lost their health insurance because of (Obamacare)." There’s no official information to corroborate Roberts’ claim. Several thousand Kansans received notices that their insurance plans could not be renewed because they did not comply with Obamacare standards, but the notices were retracted about a month later. Meanwhile, about 57,000 Kansans obtained insurance on HealthCare.gov. If the state follows the national trend, roughly half of these people were uninsured before the law. We rate Roberts’ claim False.	None	Pat Roberts	None	None	None	2014-10-09T18:39:19	2014-10-01	['None']
pomt-10099	John McCain's health care plan "won't guarantee coverage of cancer screenings or maternity care."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/27/planned-parenthood/few-guarantees-in-mccains-plan/	The Planned Parenthood Action Fund has launched an attack ad on John McCain that makes a case that his health care plan hurts women. The ad features a nurse, Shaina Klackle, talking about a study created by the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. "As a nurse, I'm concerned about your health care," Klackle says. "And so is Planned Parenthood's Action Fund. In fact, their study found John McCain's plan won't guarantee coverage of cancer screenings or maternity care." The ad goes on to make other claims about McCain's health plan, but here we wanted to look at the claim about guaranteed coverage for cancer screenings and maternity care. We should say off the bat that McCain's health plan contains no details about specific conditions or coverage. The heart of his plan seeks to stimulate the market for individual health insurance by ending the tax exemption on employer-provided health care benefits in exchange for a tax credit. McCain hopes this will lead to greater competition in the health care market by allowing people to shop around for their own insurance. Also along those lines, his plan calls for allowing people to shop for policies across state lines, so they can purchase the most effective policy, no matter where the insurance provider is located. It's that last provision that is the basis for Planned Parenthood's statement, according to the report they issued to back up the ad. Many states have passed laws that say health care providers operating in their state must provide coverage in certain areas. Planned Parenthood cites requirements for cancer screenings and maternity care in more than 20 states. Under a McCain plan, insurers could operate in any state and sell all over the country. A rollback of insurance requirements isn't spelled out in McCain's plan. But it's a reasonable fear, said Sara Collins of the Commonwealth Fund, a nonpartisan policy group that seeks to improve the health care system. Health insurance requirements differ substantially from state to state, and insurance companies would likely locate in the states with the least regulations, Collins said. "Ultimately, you would have an individual market that's not regulated in any state," Collins said. "It's very different from what we have right now." Planned Parenthood's ad says that McCain's plan doesn't "guarantee" coverage of cancer screenings or maternity care, and on a literal level, that's true. But Planned Parenthood's deeper point is that some people have a "guarantee" under their respective state's current laws, and they could lose that guarantee under McCain's plan. McCain's plan has no literal guarantees for coverage, and Planned Parenthood makes an additional case that his regulations could undermine existing state guarantees. On that basis, we rate Planned Parenthood Action Fund's statement True.	None	Planned Parenthood	None	None	None	2008-10-27T00:00:00	2008-10-24	['None']
pomt-10548	Says the difference between her and Barack Obama is "about 35 years of experience."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/19/hillary-clinton/she-has-experience-but-maybe-not-at-math/	Sen. Hillary Clinton often boasts that she has a long resume. Asked during a Texas campaign event about the difference between her and Sen. Barack Obama, Clinton replied, "Well, about 35 years of experience." But we find her math is off. Although we find here that she is largely correct when she says she has 35 years of experience in politics, she has failed to include Obama's experience in her calculation. By our count, Obama, who is 14 years younger than Clinton, has about one year running a voter-registration project, three years as a community organizer, four as a full-time attorney handling voting rights, employment and housing cases, and 12 years in the Illinois Senate and U.S. Senate. That's a total of 20 years in public policy matters. So the difference between Clinton and Obama is really 15 years. We rate her claim False.

pomt-08469	Says "Sean Duffy was a no-show" as Ashland County District Attorney while he was on the campaign trail	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/13/julie-lassa/congressional-candidate-julie-lassa-says-gop-rival/	Ashland County’s Courthouse couldn’t be much smaller -- one judge, one district attorney, one part-time assistant DA. So it was no surprise that Dan Goglin, the part-time assistant DA, stirred attention when he appeared in a television ad for Democratic congressional candidate Julie Lassa ripping Sean Duffy -- his former boss and Lassa’s opponent -- for spending more time campaigning than prosecuting criminals. For most voters in the northwest Wisconsin district, both candidates are new -- they are aiming to replace retiring U.S. Rep. Dave Obey (D-Wausau), who has held the 7th District seat since 1969. The ad from Lassa, a state senator, aims to undercut Duffy by relying on first-hand testimony from someone who presumably knows his work best. "We did not see him often," Goglin says of Duffy in the ad. "His campaign was taking him away from the job." Goglin continues: "All the time, witnesses (and) victims would have to wait in the hallway for him to come to work. The quality of services that were provided to the citizens of this county suffered." Goglin’s image fades and is replaced by these words, with a voice saying: "Sean Duffy was a no show." It’s unclear whether or not the final words were spoken by Goglin. So, is Lassa right: Was Sean Duffy a "no show"? We started with Lassa’s campaign, to see what evidence they could provide beyond the testimony of Goglin, who is active in the local Democratic party. (Goglin gave $150 to Obey’s campaign fund Feb. 22. There is no indication he has contributed to Lassa’s campaign.) The Lassa campaign, relying largely on Duffy’s campaign finance reports, cited seven nights where Duffy apparently stayed out of town overnight in the time period between March 22 and June 2, 2010. The list included a GOP "Young Guns" fund-raiser in Washington, D.C., on May 25. The campaign also said Duffy didn’t log onto his work computer for 20 work days in the first six months of the year "but attended campaign events on more than half of those same dates." A little background will help here. Duffy served about eight years as district attorney for the small county in far northern Wisconsin. He was appointed by former Gov. Scott McCallum, a Republican, and soon hired Goglin as his part-time assistant. In July 2009, Duffy announced he would challenge Obey, the third most senior member of the U.S. House and chair of the powerful Budget Committee. In late April, 2010, The New York Times ran a front-page story noting Obey faced a stiff challenge. Ten days later Obey, made the surprise announcement that he was retiring. Now an open seat, the race became even more of a target for national Republicans and the campaign heated up. In June 2010, Duffy resigned from the $93,123-a-year job to campaign full time. Gov. Jim Doyle named his replacement, Kelly McKnight, a month later. Lassa’s evidence, on its face, does not support the charge she is making. There was no list of hearings that were delayed or any phone records of citizen complaints. Duffy, for instance, could have used vacation time on the days he was out of town or his computer was not turned on. We attempted to find Duffy’s vacation records, but there are none. As a state employee, district attorneys are allowed to take time off at will and no record is kept of that, according to McKnight, Duffy’s replacement. So Lassa’s claim hinges largely on the testimony of Goglin. We called Goglin, who refused to take our call. He said through a staff person he would not take political calls from our work phone. We left several additional messages. He did not respond. We then turned to a variety of other people familiar with the inner workings of the courthouse and the community. All said they have not been actively involved in the campaign on either side. Was Duffy a "no show" on the job, prompting complaints and problems? * "That did not seem to be the case," said Claire Duquette, editor of The Daily Press newspaper in Ashland. She said the paper had received no complaints and the paper did not hear of problems with cases being delayed or mishandled. *"Nobody called me on that," said district court administrator Scott Johnson, who added: "It’s a busy court. It was situation normal." * "As far as the court system, no," said Ashland County Clerk of Courts Katie Colgrove. "It did not come to a screeching halt." Colgrove and others said the comment about people waiting in the hallway makes sense to a point. "That sounds like a usual Monday here" when Judge Robert Eaton holds intake court for those arrested over the weekend, Colgrove said. Others noted that there isn’t a waiting room for the district attorney’s office. "The waiting room for the DA’s office is the hallway," said defense attorney Joe Rafferty, who added: "I have never seen anyone sitting on that bench." The most detail about the campaigning DA came from Nancy Thyberg, the office’s victim-witness coordinator. She said Duffy, a married father of six young kids, tried to do too much -- a full-time job and the campaign. "Sean was a very good DA, but in all honesty in the last couple of months he wasn’t there a lot," she said. "He really thought he could do both and he couldn’t. It’s just an impossible thing." She said Duffy was difficult to reach at times, and "we had some scheduling issues." She said the transition increased frustration, particularly for Goglin, who had to do more work to help run the office. McKnight, Duffy’s replacement, said there were some cases backed up when he took over but said it wasn’t clear to him whether it was because of Duffy’s campaigning or the four weeks between Duffy’s announcement and his being named to the job. Finally, Mark Perrine, assistant state public defender, said in his view Duffy was "getting a little frazzled" and that others in the office were "covering for Sean." But like others, he did not cite any cases that were delayed or specifics on items missed or mishandled. The Lassa campaign noted that between September 2009 and March 2010, Duffy’s campaign reimbursed him $13,712 for campaign-related travel. At 50 cents a mile, that means Duffy drove 27,422 miles during that period. Duffy said the figure is accurate: "I’m working my tail off here." He acknowledged the demands on his time mounted in the spring but said it did not come at the expense of his job. He said he tried to flex his schedule and came into the office on weekends. By the end of May, he said he realized campaigning in a large district would not work with his job, a position he could have held at least until the 2012 election. "I did the honorable thing" and stepped down, he said, noting he worked until Doyle named his replacement: "It’s not like I said ‘OK, I’ve moved on, see you all later.' " Lassa, it should be noted, has continued to hold her $49,943-a-year job as a state senator -- and many other officials, including gubernatorial candidates Democrat Tom Barrett (Milwaukee mayor) and Scott Walker (Milwaukee County executive) have campaigned for higher office while keeping their day jobs. So what to make of Lassa’s allegations of an AWOL DA? In making her charge, Julie Lassa cites some nights out of town and days out of the office, but by themselves they are not evidence that Sean Duffy’s campaign schedule had a negative impact on his work schedule. Thus, her claim largely centers on the testimony of assistant district attorney Dan Goglin, who cites several general examples of delays. But others at the Ashland County courthouse paint a different story and largely do not back up his claims. Nevertheless, by Duffy’s own admission, in his final months on the job it was a difficult balance. That is why, he said, he resigned -- something Lassa and other higher-office seekers have not done. We rate Lassa’s claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08793	"U.S. taxpayers are being forced to fund Feisal Abdul Rauf’s trip to the Middle East."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/19/ileana-ros-lehtinen/ileana-ros-lehtinen-peter-king-correct-federal-fun/	As the high-voltage battle over the "Ground Zero Mosque" was raging on Aug. 10, 2010, two Republican lawmakers -- Florida Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the ranking member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and New York Rep. Peter King, the ranking member on the House Homeland Security Committee -- took aim at the State Department for allegedly footing the bill for foreign travel by the imam behind the proposed center in lower Manhattan. "It is unacceptable that U.S. taxpayers are being forced to fund Feisal Abdul Rauf’s trip to the Middle East," the lawmakers wrote. "Abdul Rauf has cast blame for 9/11 on the U.S., and even refuses to call Hamas what it is –- a Foreign Terrorist Organization. This radical is a terrible choice to be one of the faces of our country overseas. The U.S. should be using public diplomacy programs to combat extremism, not endorse it. The State Department’s selection of Feisal Abdul Rauf to represent the American people through this program further calls into question the Administration’s policy and funding priorities." We're separately looking at other aspects of the controversy here, including some elements of what Ros Lehtinen and King said in their statement. But in this item, we wanted to look at the narrow question of whether the lawmakers were correct that "U.S. taxpayers are being forced to fund Feisal Abdul Rauf’s trip to the Middle East." At an Aug. 10, 2010, State Department briefing, Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs P.J. Crowley confirmed that a program under the State Department's auspices -- the Bureau of International Information Programs -- is paying for Rauf's trip. "Imam Faisal will be traveling to Qatar, Bahrain, and the UAE on a U.S. government-sponsored trip to the Middle East," Crowley said. "He will discuss Muslim life in America and religious tolerance. ... We have about 1,200 of these kinds of programs every year, of sending experts in all fields overseas. Last year we had 52 trips that were specifically focused on religious -- promoting religious tolerance. We will expect to have roughly the same number of programs this year." On Aug. 18, 2010, Fox News and the Associated Press, citing the State Department, reported that Rauf will be paid $3,000 directly by the U.S. government and that the government will pay for his airfare, lodging and expenses. The total amount for sending Rauf overseas will be roughly $16,000. Crowley noted that this will be Rauf's fourth trip overseas on the government's dime, including two of them under the administration of former President George W. Bush and one earlier this year. "In 2007, he visited Bahrain, Morocco, the UAE and Qatar," Crowley said. "And earlier this year, in January, he also visited Egypt. So we have a long-term relationship with him. You know, his work on tolerance and religious diversity is well-known and he brings a moderate perspective to foreign audiences on what it's like to be a practicing Muslim in the United States. And our discussions with him about taking this trip preceded the current debate in New York over the center." So Ros-Lehtinen is correct that the federal government (and, therefore, U.S. taxpayers) will be funding Rauf's trip to the Middle East. Some commentators have gone a step further by saying the trip is tantamount to a fundraising jaunt for Rauf's center. The Washington Times' editorial page wrote that "by funding the trip so soon after New York City's Landmarks Preservation Commission gave the go-ahead to demolish the building on the proposed mosque site, the State Department is creating the appearance that the U.S. government is facilitating the construction of this shameful structure. It gives Mr. Rauf not only access but imprimatur to gather up foreign cash. And because Mr. Rauf has refused to reveal how he plans to finance his costly venture, the American public is left with the impression it will be a wholly foreign enterprise." Crowley, in his Aug. 10 briefing, was asked about the fundraising issue. He knocked down the notion. "It is something that we have talked to him about, and we have informed him about our prohibition against fundraising while on a speaking tour," Crowley said. "We do not expect him to fundraise." We aren't rating this claim, because we don't believe it's provable either way that the trip will offer fundraising opportunities. On the one hand, the government has made clear that fundraising cannot take place during the trip. On the other hand, it's possible that the trip, indirectly, will raise Rauf's profile with people who hear him speak in Qatar, Bahrain, and the UAE and, in the process, ease future fundraising for his planned center. But while we're not taking sides on the fundraising question, we believe that the less-far-reaching statement by Ros-Lehtinen is accurate. U.S. taxpayers are indeed funding Rauf’s trip, as they have his prior two trips to the region. It's worth noting that the decision to sponsor his trip was made before the current controversy became the focus of media attention, and also that Rauf took his first State Department-funded trip during the Bush administration rather than Barack Obama. But none of those facts undercut the statement we checked by Ros-Lehtinen. We rate her statement True.

pomt-01053	The economy is "creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/21/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-us-economy-creating-jobs-fastest/	President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address was notable for its celebratory language about the state of the economy, following a recovery that was widely considered long and slow. Here’s one of the claims Obama made: "Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999." We initially read this to mean that both the economy and the number of jobs had been growing at the fastest pace since 1999. That would have been a problematic claim, since the final figures for growth in gross domestic product in 2014 aren’t in yet. However, when we asked the White House press office for clarification, they responded that the president was making two separate claims -- first, that the economy is growing, and second, that the United States is creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999. The first of those claims is clearly true -- except for one quarter of negative growth in the first quarter of 2014, the economy has been expanding -- but we weren’t sure about the second part. So we decided to take a closer look at Obama’s claim that the economy is "creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999." Looking at job growth over the course of the calendar year We looked at total nonfarm employment from December of one year to December of the next, using official figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Here’s what we found: Time period Total job growth Dec. 1998 to Dec. 1999 3,177,000 Dec. 1999 to Dec. 2000 1,946,000 Dec. 2000 to Dec. 2001 - 1,735,000 Dec. 2001 to Dec. 2002 - 508,000 Dec. 2002 to Dec. 2003 105,000 Dec. 2003 to Dec. 2004 2,033,000 Dec. 2004 to Dec. 2005 2,506,000 Dec. 2005 to Dec. 2006 2,085,000 Dec. 2006 to Dec. 2007 1,140,000 Dec. 2007 to Dec. 2008 - 3,576,000 Dec. 2008 to Dec. 2009 - 5,087,000 Dec. 2009 to Dec. 2010 1,058,000 Dec. 2010 to Dec. 2011 2,083,000 Dec. 2011 to Dec. 2012 2,236,000 Dec. 2012 to Dec. 2013 2,331,000 Dec. 2013 to Dec. 2014 2,952,000 So Obama’s on target: The job growth during calendar year 2014 was higher than any year going back to 1999. Adding some context That said, the current recovery is hardly perfect. There have been three clear periods of job growth over the past quarter century. We looked at the gain in employment between the low point in jobs and the high point (or, for the current period, the most recent month). As this chart shows, these periods of expansion were quite consistent while they lasted. SOURCE: Bureau of Labor Statistics Here’s the breakdown of the three job expansions: Time period Total jobs created Jobs created per month May 1991 - Feb. 2001 24.5 million 207,847 Aug. 2003 - Jan. 2008 8.2 million 152,167 Feb. 2010 - Dec. 2014 10.7 million 181,220 This shows that the current jobs recovery, while more robust and longer than the one from 2003-08, pales in comparison to the one that lasted from 1991-2001. Indeed, it pales in two different ways: The current job expansion has created 13 percent fewer jobs every month on average than the one in the 1990s, and it has so far lasted only half as long. The earlier expansion lasted for almost a full decade. Our ruling Obama said the economy is "creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999." The current jobs recovery isn’t perfect, but Obama is correct that it’s the fastest since 1999. So we rate the claim True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2015-01-21T16:21:46	2015-01-20	['None']
pomt-09174	"I've traveled the country advocating for the FairTax ..."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2010/jun/04/tom-graves/linder-says-graves-played-minor-role-fairtax/	U.S. Rep. John Linder (R-Ga.) and 9th Congressional District candidate Tom Graves seemed to be on the same page regarding their support for the FairTax, particularly since they spoke in favor of the idea at an event in Missouri in June 2009. Not exactly. Graves has been telling supporters and voters about his efforts to work with Linder on the FairTax. "I’ve traveled the country advocating for the FairTax, along with Herman Cain, Neal Boortz and John Linder," Graves, a former state representative, said at an April 23 candidate debate at the Georgia Mountains Center in Gainesville. Linder, who represents Georgia's 7th Congressional District and is retiring at the end of this term, says that's an exaggeration. The congressman took the unusual step of accusing Graves, a fellow Republican, of lying about his efforts to push the idea. Linder even said he "didn't know who [Graves] was or why he was there." "Tom Graves is telling you that he has traveled the nation with John Linder to sell the FairTax. That simply is not true," Linder said in a 30-second robocall on May 27 for Graves’ opponent, Lee Hawkins. The congressman added: "If a candidate is willing to lie to you to get elected, what will you expect from him after he is elected?" The Graves campaign said it is surprised by Linder’s remarks and baffled by Linder's seeming unfamiliarity with the candidate. "It’s kind of bizarre for the congressman to say he didn’t know what he [Graves] was doing there," said Graves campaign spokesman Tim Baker, who added the two men traveled together to the event. We decided to check out how involved Graves has been with Linder to sell the FairTax. First, what is the FairTax? It would abolish all federal personal and corporate income taxes and other taxes, and replace them with a federal retail sales tax, according to the Web site FairTax.org. It essentially is a consumption tax -- the more you buy, the more tax you pay. The FairTax is an important cause to Linder. He’s been advocating the idea for more than a decade and co-wrote a book with Boortz explaining its benefits. Jennifer Drogus, Linder's communications director, said her boss appreciates Graves' support for the FairTax. But Linder felt like Graves exaggerated his role in the effort. We asked Graves campaign officials whether they thought their candidate was exaggerating things a bit by saying he "traveled the country" in support of the idea. "The record speaks for itself," said Baker, the campaign manager. "If you look at the fact, he was there." When asked whether they made other trips to talk about the FairTax, the Graves campaign focused on that Missouri trip as proof that their candidate is correct. Yes, they made a trip halfway across the country. But we think one trip to Missouri does not equate to "traveled the country." We find Tom Graves’ claim is Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-07294	Next year, "you will be mandated by federal law to get rid of your existing light bulbs."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/20/chain-email/conservative-group-claims-new-law-would-require-pe/	A fundraising letter making the rounds from a conservative political action committee draws a political line in the sand over light bulbs. The letter, circulated by AmeriPAC, a political action committee that largely supports conservative Republican candidates, claims President Barack Obama is "banning" incandescent light bulbs in favor of compact fluorescent lighting. It includes a lengthy letter purported to be written by Ron Arnold of the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise Action Fund. "A silly little light bulb is merely a small piece of the larger puzzle of global socialism that he feels is his agenda to enslave the American people -- and to choke Americans from a free enterprise system!" the letter states. The letter seeks contributions and support for S.B. 395, the Better Use of Light Bulbs (BULB) Act, sponsored by Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., which seeks to repeal the light bulb efficiency standards included in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. We're writing about several claims in the letter, but here, we wanted to set the record straight on one of its worst inaccuracies. "Next year your light bulbs will be obsolete," the letter reads. "You will be mandated by federal law to get rid of your existing light bulbs." A few paragraphs later, the letter hits on the same idea, stating, "Next year you will be required to trade in -- whoops...throw away...your trusty incandescent light bulbs so you will supposedly be 'environmentally-safe' with much more expensive Compact Fluorescent Light Bulbs (CFLs)." Sec. 321 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 spells out the new standards for light bulbs, essentially requiring them to be 25 percent more efficient. The idea is that, over time, more efficient light bulbs will replace older, less efficient ones. But there is nothing in the bill that requires you to get rid of the light bulbs you've got. Rather, the bill sets standards for new light bulbs "manufactured or imported" to the United States. Just to be sure, we asked Jen Stutsman, a spokeswoman for the Department of Energy, who said, "The standards apply to bulbs being imported or manufactured after the standards go into effect." Not only can people keep using their existing bulbs, she said, stores can continue to sell the old ones -- even after the new standards are in place -- until they are sold out. "There are no energy police coming to your home to make you remove your light bulbs," scoffed Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. We asked Arnold of the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise Action Fund, who is purported to have penned the letter, about the claim. Initially, Arnold told us "that's probably not a very good way to put that. I could have been more careful with that." Then he said he didn't recall including such a phrase in his letter at all. When we sent him a copy of the letter we received, he said it was "an earlier version that was sent out by AmeriPAC, which had no reason to believe it was wrong in any part." Arnold attached another version of the letter, the one he said CDFE sent out, and it words the claim a little more carefully: "Democrats in Congress have mandated that you must give up using traditional light bulbs all because environmentalists believed that traditional light bulbs caused global warming." But we're fact-checking the earlier version from AmeriPAC because it was widely circulated and spread even further via chain e-mail. The claim that next year, "you will be mandated by federal law to get rid of your existing light bulbs," has no basis in fact. It amounts to a manufactured, baseless charge, and we rate it Pants on Fire.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2011-05-20T15:03:29	2011-05-16	['None']
pomt-11809	Congressional Republicans "want to take health care from millions of Americans in order to pay for" a tax bill.	half-true	/new-york/statements/2017/nov/16/andrew-cuomo/what-impact-will-eliminating-individual-mandate-ha/	Republican efforts to reverse portions of the Affordable Care Act are not over yet. A few months after failing to pass a bill repealing and replacing the law, some senators are pushing to add a provision to the tax overhaul bill that would repeal the individual mandate, which requires Americans to have health insurance coverage or else pay a tax penalty. While the repeal provision wasn’t in the original version of the bill released by Senate Republican leaders, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said on Twitter he would introduce an amendment to add it. Democratic critics of both the tax bill and the effort to undo the Affordable Care Act pounced on this development. "Apparently giving a massive tax cut to corporations and the wealthy wasn't enough for the GOP. Now they want to take health care from millions of Americans in order to pay for it," tweeted New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We wondered whether Cuomo was right to say that congressional Republicans "want to take health care from millions of Americans in order to pay for" a tax bill. We found his phrasing misses some important points, including this one: Many Americans would be choosing to give up their health insurance if the individual mandate were lifted. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo at a news conference on Nov. 2, 2017. (Jefferson Siegel/New York Daily News/TNS) Where Cuomo has a point In the tweet, Cuomo linked to a story in The Hill newspaper headlined, "Senate GOP tax bill will include repeal of ObamaCare mandate." The article supports Cuomo’s assertion that savings from eliminating the individual mandate could help offset lower revenues from tax cuts elsewhere in the bill. The general principle is this: The more money an additional tax bill provision saves for the Treasury, the more tax cuts lawmakers can propose without adding more to the deficit. Getting rid of the mandate "will raise an estimated $300 billion to $400 billion … that could be used to pay for lowering individual and business tax rates even further," The Hill article said. The estimate cited in The Hill story originated with an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan office that studies legislative proposals for Congress. The CBO projected that eliminating the individual mandate would reduce the federal deficit by $338 billion over 10 years. The savings would come from a reduction in subsidy payments for people who currently buy insurance on the law’s online marketplaces but would not do so if the mandate was lifted, and from reductions in Medicaid payments. Collectively, these reductions would more than balance out the loss of penalty payments by uninsured Americans, which CBO projected to be $43 billion in 10 years. Meanwhile, the CBO also projected that 4 million fewer Americans would have health insurance in 2019 as a result of the individual mandate being eliminated, which would rise to 13 million in 2027. What Cuomo’s claim doesn’t tell you Cuomo is putting the cart somewhat before the horse. For starters, the provision is already controversial among some senators, including Susan Collins, R-Maine -- one of the GOP senators who sank the previous repeal-and-replace effort and whose support is widely expected to be crucial for passing the tax bill. And even if a Senate bill that includes the individual mandate repeal does pass, the same language appears unlikely to be in the House bill. In remarks to CNBC, House Speaker Paul Ryan said that his chamber would not include the provision in the version it takes up on the floor, though he left open the possibility that it could be included in the "conference committee" version of the bill that attempts to iron out differences between any bills that pass the House and Senate. The bigger problem, however, is Cuomo saying that the GOP will be taking away people’s coverage. In reality, it’s more complicated than that. Some Americans who are only buying insurance today under threat of the mandate will choose to drop their coverage voluntarily. But if this group is healthier than average, as health care economists say is likely, then the people remaining in the insurance pools would be less healthy — and thus more costly to insure. That would increase premiums, potentially squeezing out some people who, all things considered, would have rather kept their insurance. If the mandate is lifted, no one knows for sure how many people will drop their coverage voluntarily and how many will have their insurance stripped against their will. The CBO figures do not drill down into the reasons that people will be uninsured -- just that they will be uninsured. Here’s CBO’s summary (look at the bottom line). See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Christine Eibner, a health policy analyst with the RAND Corp., said it’s "reasonable" to argue that the disenrollment from Medicaid would be voluntary, since price would not be a factor for beneficiaries. This would account for 1 million fewer Americans with insurance in 2019 and 5 million fewer in 2027, the bulk of them "voluntary." Eibner said it’s harder to guess about disenrollments from the individual market. (The individual market consists of policies purchased outside the employer-provided insurance market.) In previous research, RAND estimated that roughly two-thirds of disenrollment would stem from voluntary choices and one-third would be due to price increases. Other research has put the percentage at about 50-50, said Linda Blumberg, a health policy specialist at the Urban Institute. Cuomo did say "millions" rather than specifying CBO’s 13 million figure, and even on the lower end, estimates such as these could well produce "millions" of involuntary losses of coverage. But it’s worth remembering that there’s a lot of uncertainty in the numbers. Our ruling Cuomo said that congressional Republicans "want to take health care from millions of Americans in order to pay for" a tax bill. Cuomo has a point that Republicans would be able to increase the size of their tax cuts if they could count on a projected $338 billion in added revenue over 10 years, and ending the individual mandate would result in an estimated 13 million fewer Americans with health coverage by 2027. However, it’s worth pointing out that ending the individual mandate isn’t the same thing as stripping away health insurance away for a large number of Americans. While some would lose access to health insurance due to increased premiums, many others would drop their coverage voluntarily. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-15229	Wisconsin’s "rainy day fund" is "165 times bigger than when we first took office."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/aug/07/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-wisconsin-reserve-fund-165-times/	One of Gov. Scott Walker's talking points -- a claim about the size of Wisconsin’s budget stabilization fund -- is striking in seemingly contradictory ways. Here is how Walker phrased the claim Aug. 3, 2015 at a presidential candidate forum in New Hampshire: "Our rainy day fund's 165 times bigger than when we first took office." On one hand, "165 times" sounds like a huge increase. On the other, what was the size of the fund if it could be made 165 times larger? So let's dig in a little. To back Walker's claim, the governor's office cited two state reports. They show that the so-called rainy day fund was $1.68 million when Walker took office and now is $280 million. That's more than 165 times bigger. Some history The Wisconsin Legislature created the budget stabilization fund with a 1985 law. No significant deposits were made during the first 20 years of the fund’s existence, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the state’s budget scorekeeper. But the 2001-’03 state budget added a requirement that whenever the state budget runs a surplus, 50 percent of the surplus must be transferred to the fund. So, a governor is required to put money in the rainy day fund whenever there is a surplus; it's not a voluntary act. At the same time, a governor can take some credit for there being a surplus in the first place. There have been three deposits to the rainy day fund as a result of budget surpluses since Walker took office in January 2011: Fall 2011: $15 million. That was a result of a surplus in the final budget of Walker’s predecessor, Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle. (The end of that budget, it should be noted, came at the beginning of Walker's term. So, adjustments and actions in the final six months under Walker helped lead to the surplus.) Fall 2012: $109 million. While that was the largest deposit to the fund in state history at the time, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel noted, it was only enough to run state government for about three days. Fall 2013: $153 million. Those deposits, plus interest earned, put the total in the rainy day fund at $280 million. In 2014, with another surplus projected, Walker proposed a combination of tax cuts and adding another $117 million to the rainy day fund. But the tax-cut legislation he later signed suspended the required contributions to the fund for the 2013-’15 biennium. (The state's fiscal year runs July 1 to June 30.) Had the requirement remained in effect, it would have meant another $113 million in the rainy day fund. Walker instead used the money instead to help cut taxes. Still, there’s no question the fund has grown significantly under Walker. Our rating Walker said Wisconsin’s "rainy day fund" is "165 times bigger than when we first took office." The $280 million currently in the budget stabilization fund is 165 times larger than the $1.68 million when Walker took office. Walker signed a tax cut law in 2014 that contained a provision voiding a requirement that would have put another $113 million into the fund. But that doesn’t change how much larger the fund is.. We rate Walker’s statement True.

A story circulating on Facebook appears to offer a discount in exchange for taking a three-question survey about Walmart. Why? Because, the story says, the mammoth retailer is celebrating its 125th anniversary. First of all, Walmart was founded in 1962. So it’s at least 55, not 125. More importantly for Walmart fans, the offer is not real. Walmart spokeswoman Tara Aston confirmed the scam. "We care deeply about our customers and have procedures in place to help protect them from criminal behavior," she said. "We frequently review our educational and prevention measures and when necessary, take additional steps to better inform our customers about the dangers of scams." Walmart also clarifies on its website cases of fraud in which surveys are listed as potentially suspicious. A legitimate survey from Walmart is only taken on its official website. PolitiFact decided to test out the offer. When clicking on the survey link, we were notified that only 456 coupons remained. (That number didn’t change as we refreshed and revisited the page at different points.) The survey consists of three questions: Have you ever shopped at Walmart? You prefer Walmart because of? Are you satisfied by the services of Walmart? When we finished, we were asked to share the survey with our Facebook friends — the promised coupon never materialized. It wasn’t a bug. It’s just not real. Neither were free Delta and Southwest airline tickets. We rate this scam Pants on Fire.

pomt-08305	"Paul Workman wants to raise the sales tax."	false	/texas/statements/2010/oct/31/valinda-bolton/rep-valinda-bolton-says-paul-workman-wants-raise-s/	The run-up to Nov. 2 is full of frightful statements. For instance, a recent political mailer from Rep. Valinda Bolton, D-Austin, that casts GOP challenger Paul Workman as a vampire with a tax scheme that will suck your wallets dry. Flip the mailer over to see a picture of a Jack-O-Lantern bucket filled with money. "Paul Workman's scary sales tax: A treat for politicians and a trick on families." When Bolton's leaflet landed on our desks, we were already reviewing a similar statement from an earlier mailer. In it, Bolton says "Paul Workman wants to raise the sales tax" and that he "admitted that he supports a plan to raise the sales tax dramatically." Both ads cite a Sept. 9 Oak Hill Association of Neighorhoods (OHAN) forum where Workman and Bolton each spoke. When we asked Bolton to back up her statement, her campaign manager, Elizabeth Hartman, sent a campaign document citing both the Republican Party of Texas platform and Workman's remarks at the forum. The Bolton camp's document says that since Workman is listed as a Republican candidate on the Travis County Republican Party website and received campaign contributions from the Republican Party of Texas, "one can assume his positions are in alignment with his party's platform." According to the document, the Texas GOP's platform proposes to abolish the Internal Revenue Service, repeal the 16th Amendment — the one that allows Congress to collect income tax —and implement a national sales tax in place of all other federal taxes. "However, until such time that the income tax is abolished, we support deductions for private and home schooling, home mortgages and sales tax," the party's platform states. On the state level, the party supports abolishing "property taxes for the purpose of funding schools and to shift the tax burden to a consumption-based tax while maintaining or reducing the overall tax burden." The party opposes "all professional licensing fees and real estate and similar transaction fees or taxes," taxes on Internet sales and wants the state to repeal the revised franchise tax. Under the GOP scenario, until property taxes can be abolished property valuations should remain fixed for no less than three years following each revaluation. Currently, property is taxed based on its Jan. 1 market value. Bolton's take-away point: the platform "urges the elimination of property taxes and would have that revenue stream replaced by a consumption-based tax — in other words, a sales tax." From the OHAN forum, the Bolton camp's document quotes Workman saying: "We're not going to get an income tax in this state. It ain't gonna happen, so there's really only two ways to pay for schools. It's either going to be a property tax or it's going to be a sales tax... The only way that I would be in favor of a sales tax is if we eliminated property tax. But if you believe that the state of Texas is the one who is responsible for providing that free education, then the money needs to be collected to the state and then distributed to the school districts in some equitable basis." Workman then says that Texas would need to increase the sales tax by 5 cents for every dollar spent in order to replace the property tax system. The state sales tax is now 6.25 percent, though Texas cities, counties, transit authorities and special purpose districts can impose an additional local sales tax up to a total tax of 8.25 percent. The Bolton campaign's conclusion: "Mr. Workman gave an 'either or' scenario — property taxes or sales taxes... Workman would support his party's plan to reform school funding — to first eliminate property taxes and then to replace them with increased sales tax." On Oct. 19, Workman's campaign issued a press release responding to what it called Bolton's "intellectually dishonest attack." "Workman didn't advocate raising the sales tax at the OHAN forum," the release says. Eric Bearse, a consultant for Workman's campaign later cited another statement Workman made at the forum: "My position is that we will balance the budget by cutting spending," he said. "We will not raise taxes." Lastly, we reviewed an audio recording of Workman's Oct. 12 interview with Austin American-Statesman reporter Kate Alexander. In it, he says: "There's really in my mind only three ways to pay for schools. That's an income tax, a state sales tax, or the current system of property tax plus whatever state revenue. Because we're not going to have an income tax, and I don't know if you can get the people to buy off on a state sales tax in lieu of property tax, so it appears to me that we're liable to be just kicking the can down the road further with no real fair equitable solution to the problem." We'll stop kicking our own can to sum up what we've learned. The state GOP platform, in keeping with the so-called national Fair Tax agenda, advocates replacing current taxes with a national consumption or sales tax. (A bipartisan panel convened under former President George W. Bush estimated that such a scheme would require a sales tax of 34 percent or more.) While Workman doesn't seem to have distanced himself from his party's platform, he has indicated he has practical concerns — like getting "people to buy off on a state sales tax in lieu of property tax." True, going the GOP's preferred school-funding route would require a dramatic increase in the sales tax. Workman said as much at the forum attended by Bolton. He also said he'd favor such a change only if school property taxes were wiped out. Her statement ignores this critical fact, distorting Workman's position. We rate the statement as False.

pomt-05903	"The national debt is equal to $48,700 for every American or $128,300 for every U.S. household. It is now equivalent to the size of our entire economy."	true	/virginia/statements/2012/feb/03/randy-forbes/rep-randy-forbes-says-national-debt-comes-48700-pe/	U.S. Rep. Randy Forbes is sounding the alarm on the U.S. debt. "The national debt is equal to $48,700 for every American or $128,300 for every U.S. household," Forbes, R-4th, wrote in a January 24 blog post. "It is now equivalent to the size of our entire economy." Those are some eye-catching numbers, so wanted to see if Forbes was right. Forbes is referring to gross national debt -- which includes publicly held debt as well as the amount the government owes trust funds for Social Security and Medicare. The gross debt was about $15.2 trillion on the day the congressman made his statement, according to data from the U.S. Treasury Department. Joe Hack, Forbes’ spokesman, said the congressman used census data to break down the debt load to per-person and per-household shares. Hack referred us to the U.S. Census population clock, which continuously updates the estimated number of people living in the the nation. On Feb. 1, the clock showed the U.S. population was 312.9 million. When you divide the amount the U.S. owes creditors by the population, the national debt equals $48,686. So Forbes, rounding up, is right in saying the debt comes to $48,700 per person. Now, let’s turn to households. There were 118.7 million of them in the U.S. in March 2011, according to the most current Census Bureau estimate. Doing the math, that means the debt per household comes to $128,378 -- just above Forbes’ calculation of $128,300. Still, Forbes is comparing a January 2012 debt figure to a March 2011 household number. We found a sure-fire way to make an updated estimate. The Census 2012 Abstract of the United States shows that the size of the average household was 2.6 people in 1990, 2000 and 2010. So we divided 312.9 million (the Feb. 1, 2012 U.S. population tally) by 2.6, and arrived at 120.4 million households. That would equal $126,585 of debt per household at the of this month -- pretty close to the number Forbes cited. But if the debt comes $48,700 per person, does that mean each individual in the U.S. would end up paying that amount to make the nation whole? Bill Frenzel, a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution, said the answer is no. The debt is owed by the U.S. government, which ultimately pays up through its ability to tax, said Frenzel, a former Republican congressman. "We as individual citizens will pay for that debt in quite differing amounts," Frenzel said. Frenzel, the former ranking member of the House Budget Committee, used multi-billionaire Warren Buffett as an example. The overall amount Buffett would pay in taxes would be much higher than Americans of lesser means, he said. Breaking down the debt by person and household creates a "gee whiz" number aimed at grabbing people’s attention, Frenzel said. "The problem is that $15 trillion is such a big number that it doesn’t mean anything to anybody," he added. Patrick Louis Knudsen, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, echoed that sentiment. But he said it would be better to measure debt not by its gross total, but rather by the amount of "publicly-held" debt. "That’s how much the government actually owes to outside entities," Knudsen said. On the day Forbes made his statement, publicly-held debt was about $10.5 trillion. Running the numbers again, that would equal to $33,470 per person or $87,023 per household. Economists have told PolitiFact in recent years that publicly-held debt as well as the gross national debt tally are each valid measures of the nation’s debt load. What about Forbes’ last contention -- that the national debt is equivalent to the size of the U.S. economy? Hack cited data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis showing that the average U.S. Gross Domestic Product -- the market value of all final goods and services produced -- was $15.1 trillion throughout all of 2011. That’s just below the total debt level of $15.2 trillion. The BEA data also shows that for the last three months of last year, the GDP came in at $15.3 trillion. Still, when talking about such large numbers, that’s roughly equal to the size of the national debt. Our ruling: Forbes said the national debt is equal to $48,700 per person and $128,300 per household. He also said the debt is equivalent to the size as the U.S. economy. On all three scores, he’s pretty much on target. We rate the claim True.	None	Randy Forbes	None	None	None	2012-02-03T11:18:04	2012-01-24	['United_States']
pomt-09985	"Already we've identified $2 trillion in deficit reductions over the next decade."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/apr/21/barack-obama/obamas-claim-deficit-depends-how-you-figure-number/	President Barack Obama says his 2010 budget is a responsible plan that will reduce the deficit. "Already we've identified $2 trillion dollars in deficit reductions over the next decade," Obama said in a speech at Georgetown University on April 14, 2009. Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer called the $2 trillion number "transparently phony" and a "whopper," and we've seen similar criticisms elsewhere. So we decided to check it out. Keep in mind that the deficit is a number that reflects income minus expenses over the course of a single year. At the end of Bill Clinton's administration, the government had a few years of surplus, but since then it's been running a deficit every year. Each year's deficit gets tacked on to the growing pile of public debt. Obama's budget assumes the government's expenses will continue to exceed its income for the next four years. But it proposes policies that Obama says will make the deficit smaller. He claims the budget cuts the deficit in half over four years (a claim we found Mostly True ) and cuts deficit spending by $2 trillion over 10 years. When you talk about the deficit getting "smaller," though, you have to ask, "smaller compared to what?" The answer: smaller than it would have been without Obama's proposed changes. The reductions depend on looking 10 years into the future and comparing Obama's proposal with what we would have spent if we continued with current policies. These projected numbers of current policies are called the baseline. Obama's critics contend he's inflating the baseline. In particular, they say, Obama claims we would have spent a pile of money on "overseas contingency operations," which means the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Obama's budget then posits that he wouldn't spend that much money, and he totals up the savings at $1.6 trillion. The numbers get bigger the further into the future we go. In 2019, for example, Obama projects that he will save $187 billion than would have otherwise been spent on those "overseas contingencies." We asked the White House's Office of Management and Budget how it came up with its numbers, but we didn't hear back. We turned to several federal budget experts from across the political spectrum to see if they thought Obama was inflating the baseline. Absolutely, said Brian Riedl, a senior policy analyst with the right-leaning Heritage Foundation. "It's the equivalent to assuming an expensive vacation, then not taking it, and saying you've cut your family's budget," he said. "To claim savings off that baseline is ridiculous." The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities also looked at the $2 trillion number and found it a bit inflated. Its research said a more realistic number for deficit savings was $900 billion, a little less than half of Obama's estimate. Calculating the baseline can be an honest difference of opinion, said James Horney, the center's director of federal fiscal policy. Obama's budget "does a different thing, but I can't say it's wrong," Horney said. Also, he pointed out, Obama's budget increases revenues by letting the Bush tax cuts expire on people who make more than $200,000 a year for singles or $250,000 for couples. The Obama budget document shows a deficit reduction of $636 billion over 10 years from those tax increases. Obama's critics don't mention his deficit reductions due to the tax increases, Horney said. "They don't tell you the next step, which is that he is still below current policy, because that is driven by ending the tax cuts that they support," he said. We found yet another interesting perspective from the Heritage Foundation's William Beach, the director of their center for data analysis. Beach said that the problem with Obama's budget is that he assumes he can reduce the spending on Iraq and Afghanistan at all. Beach thinks that's highly unlikely. "Everybody who has said we can reduce costs in Iraq has been wrong, whether on the left or the right," Beach said. "Everyone who goes in stays longer than they want to. It's almost like a budget trap over there." "Four years from now, Obama will be as intractably involved in Iraq and Afghanistan as he is today," Beach said glumly. "I hope I'm wrong," he added. So after hearing arguments from both sides, we agree with critics who say Obama is exaggerating his savings estimates. Even Sen. John McCain, Obama's opponent, said during the campaign that he would have brought home most of the troops in 2013 if elected president. So for Obama to estimate costs getting bigger and bigger for a full 10 years is a stretch. On the other hand, it's very difficult to say how much of a stretch it is — after all, we're talking about numbers based on predictions about complex military and global events. In one sense, Obama's statement is true. He has identified $2 trillion in deficit reductions. But presenting a budget figure 10 years out as a solid number is dicey. And people on both ends of the political spectrum say his numbers are exaggerated considerably. And we find it's significant that the estimate from the well-respected, left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities is less than half of Obama's. So we find Obama's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-13749	Unemployment numbers "are artificial numbers. These are numbers that are massaged to make the existing economy look good, to make this administration look good when, in fact, it's a total disaster."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/25/donald-trump-jr/donald-trump-jr-says-unemployment-rates-are-manipu/	Are the unemployment numbers being manipulated to make the Obama administration look good? That was the contention of Donald Trump Jr., son of the Republican presidential nominee, during the July 24 edition of CNN's State of the Union. Trump was making a point frequently made by his father — that the official unemployment rate is lower than it should be because it doesn't take into account the people who would like a job but have stopped looking. "The way we actually measure unemployment is after x number of months if someone can't find a job, congratulations, they're miraculously off," he said. "That doesn't count" in the calculation. "These are artificial numbers," Trump continued. "These are numbers that are massaged to make the existing economy look good, to make this administration look good when, in fact, it's a total disaster. ... Those are the people we want to put to work" He's correct that the widely-reported unemployment number doesn't capture the full employment picture. But for this check, we'll talk about whether the numbers are massaged to make the economy look better than it is. We've looked at the issue before with Donald Trump Sr. when he claimed the "real" rate was 18 to 20 percent (False) or may be as high as 42 percent (Pants on Fire). The unemployment rate is developed by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics based in part on data from interviews of about 60,000 households conducted by the Census Bureau As Trump Jr. indicated, it only includes people who have recently looked for a job. But that's the way it's consistently been done for decades. Alternative methods have their own limitations. Allegations of manipulation When we asked for evidence that the numbers are distorted for political reasons, Trump campaign spokesman Dan Kowalski referred us to a 2013 New York Post story alleging that the Census Bureau "faked" the sharp drop in the September 2012 unemployment rate just prior to the election that gave Obama a second term. The story's only identified source was a Census employee, Julius Buckmon, who told the Post that his superiors had told him to make up interviews that serve as the basis for the statistic. Two problems: Buckmon had left the bureau by 2012, and he told the paper he was never told to sway the statistic in favor of Obama. As we reported in 2013, even a worker who made up interviews wouldn't be able to pull enough statistical weight to significantly affect the unemployment rate for any month. A typical worker handles data from 35 to 55 of the 60,000 or so households surveyed. And the bureau routinely double-checks its findings by having households re-interviewed by a different person in an attempt to look for inconsistencies that might point to manipulation. The Office of the Inspector General at the Commerce Department concluded in May 2014 that there was "no evidence" that the numbers had been manipulated in the runup to Obama's reelection, especially when other sources confirmed the trend. The report said: "It would have taken 78 Census Bureau Field Representatives working together, in a coordinated way, to report each and every unemployed person included in their sample as 'employed' or 'not in labor force' during September 2012" to produce that kind of manipulation. Since then, unemployment has continued to fall. Artificial numbers? Other experts joined Baker in dismissing the younger Trump’s allegation about the standard unemployment rate. "The same basic definition of the unemployment rate has been used (with minor changes) going back almost all the way to World War II, under both Republican and Democratic administrations," said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. "This measure has been consistently produced following the same basic methodology in the U.S. and copied around the world for over 50 years," said Tara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University. And what about Trump's complaint that the numbers are skewed by not including people who have given up looking for work? Sinclair said the BLS tries to track that through a variation of the unemployment rate known as U-6, or the "underutilization" rate. This version includes people who have stopped looking for work but say they would start if the market improved, people working part-time because they can't get full-time work, along with the people included in the standard unemployment rate. By it's nature, the U-6 rate is higher. The June rate was 9.6 percent compared to the conventional unemployment rate of 4.9 percent. But that estimate has its limitations as well. It doesn’t count recent graduates who never entered the labor market in the first place because they feared there would be no jobs for them, and it doesn’t count people who chose to take care of their kids full-time, went back to school or retired early to avoid having to compete for a job. By that statistic, the economy is not as healthy as the conventional unemployment estimate would indicate. Casey Mulligan, professor of economics at the University of Chicago, said it's fair for the younger Trump to dispute the standard unemployment rate as an indicator of economic performance because the labor market has not gained the type of strength you would expect with the current unemployment rate. It's a question of which BLS data to use "rather than the competence of the BLS per se," he said. But Harvard University government professor Jeffrey Frankel said the important thing "is to be consistent across time in which measure you use. It wouldn't be right to switch from looking at the conventional rate to a measure that includes discouraged workers just because you don't like the incumbent president and want to make things look bad for him." Other experts were more blunt. Trump’s comment "is a reprise of the same nonsense his father floated a few months ago. It is yet another conspiracy theory that the Trumps have grabbed onto," said Neil Buchanan, a George Washington University law professor. The limitations of the unemployment number are well known, he said. "Everyone who reads an article in a decent newspaper about the employment picture each month reads about discouraged workers, part-time workers, and so on." "There are plenty of grounds for us nerd-types to complain about the accuracy of the BLS numbers," said Dean Baker, co-director of the left-leaning Center for Economic Policy and Research in Washington. "No survey is perfect and there will always be issues with how a survey is conducted and questions are posed. But the idea that BLS cooks numbers is beyond ridiculous." Our ruling Trump Jr. said that unemployment numbers "are artificial numbers. These are numbers that are massaged to make the existing economy look good, to make this administration look good when, in fact, it's a total disaster." The economists with whom we spoke said Trump is wrong to question the integrity of the federal unemployment data. The method of developing the estimates have been used for decades, their limitations are widely recognized, other economic indicators have confirmed their reliability, and there's no evidence that they have been massaged for political purposes. Because his claim is in the realm of the ridiculous, we rate it Pants on Fire! https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5ff3b1f3-79ac-4f4e-bce9-8a10cc1ddcfa	None	Donald Trump Jr.	None	None	None	2016-07-25T13:37:49	2016-07-24	['None']
pomt-01551	"Over 40 of our 100 (House of) Delegates seats go uncontested every year, and over 40 percent of our state senate seats go uncontested every year."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2014/sep/14/robert-sarvis/sarvis-says-over-40-percent-virginias-general-asse/	Libertarian U.S. Senate candidate Robert Sarvis says the two-party system leads to a lot of one-candidate elections. In a speech at the Buena Vista Labor Day Festival, Sarvis said voters need more choices, particularly in General Assembly elections. "Over 40 of our 100 (House of) Delegates seats go uncontested every year, and over 40 percent of our state senate seats go uncontested every year," Sarvis said. With all General Assembly seats up for election next year, we put Sarvis’ statement to the Truth-O-Meter. Nicholas Cote, spokesman for the Sarvis campaign, said the claim was based on election data compiled by the Virginia Public Access Project. The records examine general elections going back to 1999 and show the number of uncontested statehouse elections. All seats in the 100-member House are up for grabs every two years. Cote accurately noted that in the last eight elections, an average of 49.75 seats House seats were uncontested. That would be in line with Sarvis’ proclamation that more than 40 House of Delegates seats are one-candidate elections. All seats in the 40-member Senate are up every four years. And Cote correctly noted that an average of 17.25 Senate seats were uncontested in the last four elections. That’s an average of 43 percent per election, Cote said, consistent with Sarvis’ claim. But Sarvis didn’t phrase his statement as an average. He said "every year" more than 40 percent of the seats in each chamber weren’t contested. So we have to look at each election year individually. Here are the number of uncontested seats in biennial House elections since 1999, according to returns from the state Board of Elections: 2013 -- 45 2011 -- 63 2009 -- 31 2007 -- 59 2005 -- 51 2003 -- 61 2001 -- 40 1999 -- 48 Sarvis’ claim that "over" 40 seats went uncontested each cycle doesn’t hold up for 2009 and -- because it’s our job to be sticklers -- in 2001. Here are the number of uncontested seats in quadrennial Senate elections since 1999: 2011 -- 14 2007 -- 17 2003 -- 19 1999 -- 19 Remember, the Senate has 40 members. Sarvis’ claim that more than 40 percent of the seats went uncontested each cycle sputters in the latest election, in 2011, when 35 percent the races had no competition. Virginia’s not the only place where a significant percentage of state legislature races go uncontested each election year. An October 2012 study from the College of William and Mary found that 39.7 percent of the 6,000 statehouse races across the country that year lacked competition between major party candidates. The study examined the 44 states that had legislative races that year. Virginia wasn’t included because it holds General Assembly races in odd-numbered years. The study said legislative redistricting -- in which lawmakers draw election maps and usually fashion safe districts for themselves -- discouraged competition for statehouse seats. That would carry over to Virginia, where lawmakers control redistricting, according to John J. McGlennon, a professor of government at the College of William and Mary who co-authored the report. McGlennon said another factor deterring competition is that Virginia’s statehouse races occur in years when there are no presidential or congressional races. That means down-ballot candidates for the state legislature can’t ride a coattail effect into office, he said. Our ruling Sarvis said "every year" more than 40 percent of House and Senate seats have only one candidate. Election figures generally back Sarvis. The only blip is that during a few years -- 2011 for the Senate, as well as 2009 and 2001 for the House -- the number of uncontested races didn’t quite hit the threshold Sarvis cited. His point is basically correct but could use some additional information. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Robert Sarvis	None	None	None	2014-09-14T06:00:00	2014-09-01	['None']
pomt-10819	"The Republican governor who stood up and cut spending instead of raising taxes."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/21/mitt-romney/define-tax-increase/	This claim depends on your definition of a tax increase. As governor of Massachusetts, elected in 2002, Romney inherited a $3-billion state budget shortfall. And it's true that the budget problem was fixed without raising state income taxes. But Romney closed loopholes in the corporate income tax, which effectively increased taxes for some companies. And he and the legislature did increase a myriad of fees, on such things as boat registrations and court filings, which some might consider tax increases. Also, state payments to cities and towns for schools and police were reduced, which caused those local governments to increase property taxes. The Club for Growth, a conservative political action committee that pushes for spending cuts and tax cuts, evaluated Romney's fiscal record: "Overall, Romney's record on tax policy is mixed. His record is marred by questionable statements and positions and his fee hikes and 'loophole' closures are troubling." We will note that the Club for Growth applauded Romney for supporting broad-based tax cuts. We find his claim that he "cut spending instead of raising taxes" to be only half of the story about how he dealt with the state's financial crisis.

pomt-07047	Says that as a gubernatorial candidate, Chris Christie "promised no school cuts."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jul/01/stephen-sweeney/new-jersey-senate-president-stephen-sweeney-says-w/	Democrats and Republicans made many promises during the 2009 gubernatorial campaign, but did Chris Christie vow not to slash aid for the state’s public schools? State Senate President Stephen Sweeney claims he did. "The governor, who as a candidate promised no school cuts, was well aware that his draconian cuts to education were illegal," said Sweeney (D-Gloucester) in a May 24 press release following the New Jersey Supreme Court’s latest ruling on school funding. The court said the state had to send $500 million in additional funding to 31 urban school districts known as Abbott districts. PolitiFact New Jersey questioned Sweeney’s claim about Christie. As governor, Christie cut school funding -- he withheld $475 million in aid in 2010 and slashed $820 million in funding from the current budget.. But did he promise to maintain school funding during his campaign? We initially found some conflicting evidence, but then the governor admitted that he had made that promise. Derek Roseman, a spokesman for the Senate Democrats, sent us to two news reports to support Sweeney’s statement: an Asbury Park Press article dated Jan. 9, 2010 that said Christie "promised not to cut state aid to local school districts" and another report from the newspaper dated Oct. 14, 2009 that reported Christie "would keep local education funding flat for the year, saving the planned $500 million increase" in state aid. PolitiFact New Jersey searched newspaper archives and found more contradictory reports, some saying he would cut the aid; others saying he wouldn’t. The governor’s office did not return two requests for comment. The conflicting evidence had the Truth-O-Meter jammed, but the governor himself made a statement that tipped its scales. During a question and answer session on June 28, after the governor signed legislation overhauling public employee benefits, Christie responded to a question about a campaign promise not to change pensions for law enforcement officials. "When I got here I found circumstances to be different than the governor was characterizing them when I ran. When you are a candidate, what you are restricted to is what the current occupant of the office will tell you about the circumstances surrounding the fiscal state of New Jersey. Gov. Corzine told us that fiscal year '11 was going to be a $6 to $7 billion deficit. It turned out to be $11 billion," he said. "So, I made a lot of other promises. I also said that I wouldn't cut education aid in fiscal year 2011, but when a $6 or $7 billion budget deficit turns into a $11 billion deficit and you don't have the option to print money, you got to make a lot of decisions." Now, let’s return to Sweeney’s statement. Sweeney said Christie promised during his campaign that he would not cut school funding. The spokesman for the Senate Democrats provided conflicting evidence to support Sweeney’s claim and PolitiFact New Jersey found even more conflicting evidence in news reports. However, Christie himself recently said he promised not to cut school aid while he was a candidate. We can’t argue with that. We rate Sweeney’s statement True.

pomt-07346	During the Eisenhower Administration, "not a single soldier … died in combat."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/10/doris-kearns-goodwin/doris-kearns-goodwin-says-no-us-combat-deaths-unde/	During the May 8, 2011, edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, historian and author Doris Kearns Goodwin offered a striking statistic about combat casualties under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Host David Gregory began the exchange by playing a video clip from Robert Kagan, a foreign policy scholar and commentator who has advised several Republican office-holders. "The American people," Kagan said, "have an interesting quality in their character which you can trace all through their history. They want their presidents to be men of peace, but they also want to know that, if necessary, the American president can kill." Gregory asked Goodwin whether she thought Kagan had a worthwhile point in analyzing President Barack Obama’s recent success in ordering the killing of al-Qaida mastermind Osama bin Laden. "I think that's right," Goodwin said. "I mean, think of two of our most lovable presidents, Theodore Roosevelt, what was his slogan? Speak softly and carry a big stick. This was a big stick. Eisenhower, having won World War II, could then take enormous pride in the fact that not a single soldier had died in combat during his time. So I think what happened in this thing is, it's not just the public perception of Obama that's strengthened now because he acted as commander in chief, but you never know what happens internally to a president when they take a risky thing and it works. JFK took control of his presidency after the Cuban missile crisis. This guy will now take control of his presidency. I think he's going to be able to trust his own judgment even more than the military, and that's huge psychologically. And America feels better again. I mean, that's the huge thing that we don't know about how long that will last. But our prestige and our sense of ourself is now heightened for a while, and everybody wants that." We thought we’d look into whether Goodwin was correct that "not a single soldier … died in combat" during the Eisenhower presidency. We knew that Goodwin’s claim had problems when we checked the starting and ending dates of the Korean War. It was an active conflict through the signing of a truce on July 26, 1953. Since Eisenhower was inaugurated on Jan. 20, 1953, he served as commander-in-chief for the final six months of the war. His presidency ended on Jan. 20, 1961. The final six months of the Korean war included a battle that became emblematic of the war -- the Battle of Pork Chop Hill. The battle produced many casualties at a time when the powers were negotiating an armistice, even though the battle was fought to control a topographic feature that had little inherent value. In his book The Korean War, Max Hastings wrote that the battle reflected both the "courage of the defenders and the tactical futility" of that stage of the war. How many casualties were there during those six months? We didn’t find any official government data with casualties separated by year, but we did find a private collection. The veteran-supported Korean War Project has a website that offers day-by-day casualty figures for the war. So we looked at the figures for the first six months of Eisenhower’s presidency and found 3,406 casualties. Casualties, however, include non-combat deaths and non-mortal wounds, not just combat deaths. So we took casualty ratios for the entire Korean War and determined that combat deaths accounted for 24 percent of casualties. Multiplying this percentage by the number of casualties produces 802 combat deaths during Eisenhower’s six months in charge. (The total for the war was almost 34,000.) The figure we came up with isn’t exact, but it seems safe to assume that combat deaths during that period numbered in the hundreds. In addition, Eisenhower was president during the start of U.S. involvement in Vietnam. At the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on the National Mall, the names of the fallen begin with Air Force T-Sgt. Richard B. Fitzgibbon Jr., with a casualty date of June 8, 1956. The number of casualties in Vietnam remained much smaller than the number during the final part of the Korean War. The first battlefield fatality came in late 1961, almost one year into the Kennedy Administration. Eisenhower also presided over some small-scale military deployments in or near Taiwan, Lebanon and Cuba, and he was president during the Suez crisis of 1956. But we were unable to confirm any casualties for these events. Meanwhile, a lower-profile source of U.S. casualties stemmed from covert operations related to the Cold War. "Eisenhower ordered a wide array of covert operations against the Soviet Union and Communist China, including clandestine overflights of both countries, during his two terms, and some of those missions involved American deaths," said Lance Janda, a historian at Cameron University in Lawton, Okla. "The deaths were generally kept secret and did not occur during declared wars or major operations known to the public, and for that reason a scholar might argue they technically do not fall into the ‘combat death’ category. But I would find that line of reasoning extremely suspect. Eisenhower ordered Americans into harm’s way in support of the national interest, and their deaths therefore fall very clearly in my view under his responsibility as commander-in-chief." All this means Goodwin’s statement is incorrect. She’s "wrong, and not just technically so," said William W. Stueck, a historian at the University of Georgia. When we contacted Goodwin, she immediately acknowledged her error. "What I was reaching for when I talked was a more general point -- which is accurate -- that the general who had overseen major battles in a time of war was basically a man of peace during his presidency, thus fitting the idea that Americans love men of peace who can also kill," Goodwin said. "That would have been a better way of putting it!" Goodwin does have a point. After the shooting war on the Korean peninsula had ended -- a war that Eisenhower had inherited and which he ended within six months-- Eisenhower did preside over a relatively peaceful seven and a half years, particularly compared to his two immediate predecessors (Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman) and two of his three successors (Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon). "Eisenhower was extremely skillful when it came to foreign policy and military affairs," Janda said. "He was extraordinarily judicious in his application of American power, negotiating severe crises over Indochina in 1954, the Taiwan Strait in 1955, and Suez in 1956, which could easily have led to massive U.S. intervention and/or the use of nuclear weapons. He was also a powerful proponent of covert operations and diplomacy during one of the most difficult periods of the Cold War and the president who argued most forcefully of the dangers posed by the military-industrial complex. He should be celebrated for those achievements, but not by overstating the facts." We agree that Goodwin’s broader point is reasonable, and we appreciate her quick acknowledgement of error. Still, she made a pretty clear-cut mistake: Hundreds of combat deaths is a number vastly greater than saying that "not a single soldier had died in combat" under Eisenhower. So we rate her statement False.	None	Doris Kearns Goodwin	None	None	None	2011-05-10T12:02:53	2011-05-08	['None']
pomt-09887	Health insurance companies are "making record profits, right now."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/23/barack-obama/health-insurance-company-turned-profit-not-rec/	President Barack Obama has often argued that health insurance companies need more competition, and he's proposed a public option for health insurance to provide it. "There have been reports just over the last couple of days of insurance companies making record profits, right now," Obama said during a prime-time news conference. "At a time when everybody's getting hammered, they're making record profits, and premiums are going up. What's the constraint on that? ... Well, part of the way is to make sure that there's some competition out there." We wanted to know if he was correct that insurance companies are making record profits during one of the worst economic recessions on record. It seems likely that Obama was referring to the latest earnings report from UnitedHealth Group, one of the largest publicly traded health insurance companies. The day before Obama's news conference, UnitedHealth had announced unexpectedly robust profits that prompted the company to revise its annual earnings guidance upwards. There are many ways to look at a company's earnings, but Obama said "profits," so we looked at net income, which is revenue minus expenses. For the quarter, UnitedHealth earned $859 million. But that's not a record for quarterly net income. During the same period in 2007, for example, its net income was $1.23 billion. We reviewed the income statements of the other largest publicly traded health insurance companies — WellPoint, Aetna, Cigna, Humana and Coventry Health Care — and found similar trends. Generally speaking, profits were higher during 2007 and 2006, before the economy began its slide. So Obama's modifier "record" does not appear to be correct. Of these companies, only UnitedHealth has announced its second quarter earnings. Coventry Health Care is set to announce earnings on July 28; Aetna and WellPoint on July 29; Cigna on July 30 and Humana on Aug. 3. Still, UnitedHealth did make healthy profits, and we asked Steve Shubitz, a health care financial analyst with the investment firm Edward Jones, about it. "The profits are still significant, there's no question about that. But the reality is they're losing a lot of customers in this economy," Shubitz said. When companies lay off workers and the workers lose their health insurance, the insurance companies lose customers, and that's why UnitedHealth has seen declining enrollments, he added. If UnitedHealth only offered insurance to companies, "they would not have had a very good quarter because of the numbers of customers they've lost," Shubitz said. But UnitedHealth has diversified, and its business with the government health programs Medicare Advantage and Medicaid performed well, as did divisions that handle pharmaceuticals and health information technology. Shubitz added that the stock prices for health insurance companies are not as high as one might expect, because of impending efforts at health reform. "There are so many different possibilities of what can happen," said Shubitz, who also follows WellPoint and Aetna and has "hold" recommendations on all three. "A lot of this uncertainty is already priced into these stocks." Getting back to our ruling, we wonder if Obama was simply remembering a story he'd read in the paper that day and puffed it up a bit. One health insurance company did report unexpected profits. But it's not clear yet whether others will. And the profits UnitedHealth reported were not "record profits." We find his statement False.

pomt-14149	Missouri "is the state with the lowest paid workers."	half-true	/missouri/statements/2016/may/02/kiki-curls/missouri-state-senator-half-right-pay-states-worke/	Following a Missouri Senate Budget Committee hearing about Medicaid coverage, Sen. Kiki Curls claimed on April 4 that Missouri "is the state with the lowest paid workers." We decided to see how Missouri's workers compare to the rest of the country. Curls' office didn't respond to our requests for the background information behind her claim. We see three ways to read her words. She might be talking about all workers, just private sector workers, or possibly, just state government workers. We examined all three. All Workers The latest numbers from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics show the average weekly wage for all workers in Missouri is $846. This number places Missouri 31st and well above the state with the lowest paid workers, Mississippi, where workers make an average weekly wage of $706. Private Sector BLS reports show that in Missouri the average weekly wage in the private sector is $851. The national average is $965 per week. This ranks Missouri in the bottom half of all states, but far from having "the lowest paid workers." Public Sector The BLS also reports the average weekly wages for state workers. In the third quarter of 2015, Missouri's state government employees made an average weekly wage of $803. This puts Missouri dead last of all the states. The national average weekly wage is $1,083 for state government employees, more than $200 over Missouri's average. Our Ruling Sen. Kiki Curls claimed that Missouri "is the state with the lowest paid workers." We don't know if she meant all workers, workers in the private sector or state government workers. For any analysis that includes private sector employees, Missouri ranks closer to the bottom than the top, but it does not rank last. Missouri does hold the distinction of having the lowest paid state workers, based on their average weekly wages. That's enough to make her statement partially accurate. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-02965	"About 47 percent of able-bodied people in the state of Maine don’t work."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/23/paul-lepage/maine-gov-paul-lepage-says-47-percent-able-bodied-/	Maine’s Republican governor, Paul LePage, has a history of making controversial comments, from telling the NAACP that the group can "kiss my butt" to charging that a Democratic legislative leader "claims to be for the people but he’s the first one to give it to the people without providing Vaseline." Recently, LePage made another comment that has attracted national attention. On Oct. 22, 2013, a blogger for the Bangor Daily News posted an audio clip from a speech LePage made in Falmouth, Maine. Here’s what the blogger wrote: "Informed that the event was wrapping up, LePage said he had two more points to make. The first was just one word: ‘energy.’ The second was, he said, in reference to ‘workforce development.’ "‘About 47 percent of able-bodied people in the state of Maine don’t work,’ said LePage. "On the recording you can hear a member of the audience ask, ‘What?’ LePage repeats himself. ‘About 47 percent. It’s really bad.’" The blog post inspired a flurry of media attention, in part because LePage’s comment echoed the one from the 2012 presidential campaign in which Republican nominee Mitt Romney said that 47 percent of the American people are "dependent upon government." Romney’s comment was widely considered a blunder that hampered his bid for the White House. But what about the substance of LePage’s remark? Was he correct that "about 47 percent of able-bodied people in the state of Maine don’t work"? The strength or weakness of Maine’s labor market isn’t out of the mainstream; the unemployment rate in August 2013 was 7.0 percent, putting it in a six-way tie for 22nd place nationally. We contacted LePage’s press office for supporting evidence, but no one responded. A spokeswoman for LePage did send Huffington Post a statement, saying in part that "the governor understands that not everyone who is dependent on taxpayer dollars is 'able-bodied,' but he does believe that everyone, regardless of their ability or physical condition, can contribute to society in a meaningful way." The Census Bureau found that Maine’s estimated population in 2012 was 1,329,192. Meanwhile, the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that in August 2013, Maine had 659,059 people employed. So by the roughest calculation, Maine had 670,133 people not working, or about 50 percent. This number would suggest that LePage is in the ballpark. But calling this a "rough" calculation is too kind. It’s actually a silly way of calculating it. First, doing it this way suggests that everybody -- no matter how old or young -- should be working. The numbers change dramatically if you exclude Maine residents up to age 18 and over 65 from the statistics. In 2012, Maine’s 18-to-64 population was 836,898. Using this as the denominator means that about 21 percent of Maine residents were not working. What about LePage’s reference to "able-bodied people"? The Census Bureau has estimated that in 2011, Maine had 101,000 people aged 18 to 64 who have a "health problem or disability which prevents them from working or which limits the kind or amount of work they can do." If you subtract this group, then there were 735,898 "able-bodied people" age 18 to 64 in Maine, and only 10 percent of them were not working. Finally, in August 2013, there were 49,966 unemployed people in Maine. These are people who have looked for work recently but have not found it. If you add these to the number of employed Maine residents, then just 3.6 percent of able-bodied Maine residents aged 18 to 64 are neither working nor actively looking for employment. That’s far off from the 47 percent LePage claimed. It’s possible to quibble about the specifications we’ve used, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. For instance, you could get a bit closer to LePage’s 47 percent figure if you counted 16- and 17-year olds or people up to age 74, who have been working in growing numbers in recent years. Still, Burtless said, "even if you tried to include all the ‘able-bodied’ Maine residents past 65 in your calculations, I'm pretty confident you'd find Gov. LePage's claim to be ridiculous." Our ruling LePage said that "about 47 percent of able-bodied people in the state of Maine don’t work." Unless LePage thinks newborns and nonagenarians ought to get off their tushes and find a job, this is a ridiculous claim. In reality, only about 10 percent of able-bodied Maine residents aged 18 to 64 aren’t employed. And if you include those who are actively looking for work but who can’t find a job in today’s poor economy, the figure drops as low as 3.6 percent. We rate LePage’s claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-05089	The transportation tax is regressive, and Emory University is "literally getting its own transit line at virtually no cost to itself."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/jul/02/georgia-green-party/transportation-tax-opponents-says-emory-gets-free/	Georgia voters will decide on a series of regional transportation plans in the July 31 primaries that could bring as much as $8.5 billion in new spending to metro Atlanta alone. The money would come from a special 1-cent sales tax dedicated to dozens of road, rail and other projects. The plan has a lot of support from the business community, but groups across the political spectrum oppose it. For example, the left-leaning Georgia Green Party has circulated a list of the "top ten lies" about the referendum, including a claim that the projects are giveaways to rich businesses and institutions at the expense of working people who would pay the "regressive" tax. The flier specifically mentions a proposed $700 million MARTA rail spur from the Lindbergh Center station to the Emory University campus. "Sales taxes [are] highly regressive, falling most heavily on low income consumers, much more lightly on higher income persons and almost not at all on big corporations and other wealthy institutions like Emory University, which is literally getting its own transit line at virtually no cost to itself," the flier claims. If the referendum passes, the 3.7-mile rail line is scheduled to be built along the Clifton Corridor around 2020. Hugh Esco, a member of the state Green Party committee, said the line is an example of the problem with using sales taxes to fund infrastructure projects. "We’re being asked to pony up ... to pay for this new construction," he said. "If there were no other mechanisms for raising funds, that might be appropriate." Esco said the rail line to Emory is an example of working-class people subsidizing a benefit for a wealthy institution. As a nonprofit, private university, Emory does not pay sales tax, so the university itself will not contribute to building the line. "This is insane to ask us to pay for this nonsense. This isn’t serving the general public," he said. Let’s split the Green Party claim into its two basic parts: -- Sales taxes are regressive and place a heavier burden on the poor. -- Because the line is built with sales tax money, big business and institutions such as Emory are getting something for nothing. Georgia State University economist David Sjoquist said the regressiveness of the sales tax depends on how you look at it. "Conventional wisdom is that if you look at annual income, people with lower income pay a higher percentage of their income in sales taxes," he said. In that sense, the Green Party is right that the sales tax is regressive. A 1 percent sales tax on groceries means more to a person making $18,000 a year than someone making $180,000 a year. The Green Party claims that big businesses pay almost no sales taxes. That’s not true. Sjoquist said businesses account for between 35 percent and 40 percent of sales tax collection in Georgia. "They buy a computer, a desk, food for parties, they pay sales tax," he said. "They are paying a share of this." But he said businesses have a choice when paying that tax to either eat it or pass that cost along. Except in highly competitive situations, sales taxes that businesses pay end up being passed down to the consumer in higher prices or to employees in lower wages, he said. Sjoquist said the inequities of the sales tax tend to flatten out over a consumer’s lifetime due to changes in how people of even modest incomes spend and save, but he said people typically don’t look at it that way. That gets to the Green Party’s second point: The proposed line to Emory is a freebie catering to a wealthy private university. While it may be true that Emory -- as an institution -- would not pay the sales tax (private colleges are specifically exempt), Douglas Hooker, executive director of the Atlanta Regional Commission, said another funding mechanism might make little difference. "Large institutions that are nonprofits tend not to pay any kind of tax, so this is no different," he said. But it is not true that Emory has nothing invested in the effort. Hooker said the university is a member of the Clifton Corridor Transportation Management Association, which funded the design of the rail spur. That design work costs money, but it is just a tiny fraction of the cost of building it. So, if Emory doesn’t pay into the sales tax, is it true the university would get its "own transit line"? According to a project fact sheet developed for the referendum, the line would have five stations with an estimated 10,300 daily boardings. Emory spokesman Ron Sauder said the line would serve people heading to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, among other big employers. Emory is by far the largest of the employers in the corridor, plus it has more than 7,200 students in its undergraduate programs alone. Emory would likely claim a large share of the ridership on the rail line. But not all of it. Sauder said Emory already operates a shuttle bus fleet and subsidizes public transit fees for employees, but the line isn’t "just about Emory." ARC spokeswoman Julie Ralston said this: ""That’s the largest employment center in DeKalb County. Those are jobs that contribute to the livelihoods of people. It’s been part of an aspirational plan for a long time to have rail in that area." So where does that leave the Green Party’s two-barreled statement? There is general agreement that the sales tax is more of a burden on lower-income people than people with higher incomes, businesses and nonprofit institutions. But there is also evidence that the proposed rail line is not simply a paean to Emory University. Half the Green Party statement is true; the other half, not so much.

pomt-02693	The Obama administration offered "no magic number" of people that needed to sign up for health care on the marketplaces.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/05/gene-sperling/obama-economic-adviser-gene-sperling-says-theres-n/	What botched rollout? That was so 2013. Talking points from President Barack Obama’s advisers are pointing to something new about Obamacare, something that sounds good: About 2.1 million people signed up for health insurance plans through the federal and state marketplaces. NBC’s Meet the Press host David Gregory posed a key follow-up question to Obama economic adviser Gene Sperling during the Jan. 5 show: Is the progress good enough for the administration to meet its original goal? "2.1 million have signed up. The goal is 7 million by March. How do you think you realistically get there?" Gregory said. "Well, first of all, there’s no magic number," Sperling said. "The key is to enroll as many people, have an exchange that’s working, have a stable exchange ..." "The secretary of Health and Human Services said that was success, 7 million by March," Gregory said. "I think success is having an ongoing, strong market," Sperling said. PolitiFact wanted to know: Is Sperling trying to rewrite the past by saying Obama had "no magic number" for the number of people that need to sign up for coverage by the end of open enrollment in March? (We offer a hat-tip to our friend The Fact Checker of the Washington Post, which recently visited this topic after White House health care adviser Phil Schiliro made a similar denial on MSNBC.) The 7 million mark There were at least two times Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, the official Obama appointed to oversee the agency in charge of implementing Obamacare, referred to 7 million as the mark. The number, though, didn’t come from her. The figure originated with the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which analyzes the impact of legislation. In February 2013, CBO estimated 7 million people would sign up for health insurance through the federal and state marketplaces starting in October through the end of March, the deadline to enroll and avoid a tax penalty. By 2024, enrollment in the marketplaces would be 24 million, CBO said. Sebelius offered cautious optimism about the target for enrollment in a June press briefing and pointed out the sheer size of the risk pool is not the only concern. "We're hopeful that 7 million is a realistic target and that we're going to be driving our efforts toward that kind of enrollment effort," she said. "And it's both about numbers and also hopefully getting a balanced risk pool." A Politico story covering her appearance opened with, "For Obamacare the magic number is 7 million." A leaked Sept. 5 memo from another high-ranking HHS official, Marilyn Tavenner, to Sebelius outlined the department’s month-by-month projections for enrollment. Drawing on the estimates from CBO, as well as "the experience of Commonwealth Care in Massachusetts, Medicare Part D, and conversations with employers, issuers and states," Tavenner wrote that she expected marketplace enrollment to start at a slow pace but ramp-up in December and March, the months with deadlines. Tavenner’s memo anticipated 3.3 million people to have enrolled by Dec. 31, rising to 7.066 million by March 31. Remember, the estimates and targets from CBO and Tavenner happened before healthcare.gov made its dysfunctional debut. That was not part of the equation. On Sept. 30, the night before the exchanges opened, NBC Nightly News aired an interview with Sebelius in which a reporter asked her, "What does success look like?" "I think success looks like at least 7 million people having signed up by the end of March 2014," Sebelius said. The next few weeks were not pretty, to say the least. The online federal marketplace wasn’t ready, with big kinks preventing lots of people from buying plans. Some people, like Wonkblog’s Ezra Klein, argued CBO’s estimates should be tossed because October and November were lost months. The Obama administration considers someone to be "enrolled" if they select a plan, not necessarily if they paid for it. Data is not yet available for people who paid a first month’s premium to their insurers. Couching it HHS and White House spokespeople directed us to recent statements by administration officials whose answers about the 7 million goal mirror Sperling’s. For example, senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer said on ABC’s This Week on Nov. 3, "Well, that’s a goal that the CBO said is what they thought would happen. Our goal is to get as many people done as possible." The position, said HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters, has been the mix of people is more important than the number. She pointed to Sebelius’ June comments and a late November post by Klein, who said White House officials told him as he reported a July story they defined success as "a function of the mix of people in the exchanges -- the ‘ratio’ -- rather than the number of people in the exchanges." The administration made plans for a marketing campaign aimed at signing up young adults who tend to be healthier and uninsured. A good health mix in each risk pool is crucial to control costs, and sick people who require more care "are most likely to sign up and do so early," said Gail Wilensky, an expert on the health care law who was the director of Medicaid and Medicare under President George H.W. Bush. At this point, we don’t know much background about the enrollees, such as health and payment status. Obama’s officials are not backtracking so much as they are "realizing that factors are coming into play that weren’t expected," said Timothy Jost, a Washington and Lee University law professor who is an expert on the law. "I really think it’s still possible by March to get 7 million," Jost said, adding that it’s "meaningless" that there are not as many people signed up by the end of the year as once projected. Other experts, such as Stan Dorn, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, have been quoted as saying the federal marketplace will function properly even with as low as 2 million enrollees. "Everyone's been trumpeting this 7 million target," Dorn told USA Today. "I think they can fall well short of it and still be on their way to a very successful program." Our ruling Sperling denied the administration had a "magic number" for how many people it wanted to see enrolled through the exchanges for health insurance coverage. No one knows how many people need to sign up to make the health care law work. And Sperling has a point that the mix of individuals signing up is likely more important than the raw number. But the Obama administration has used a number -- 7 million by March -- in the past. There’s no denying that. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-11272	Says of disclosing his $20,000 speech about Syria, "there was no hiding. I released it."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2018/apr/26/dennis-kucinich/dennis-kucinich-said-he-didnt-hide-payment-syria-s/	When Dennis Kucinich amended his financial disclosure to show that he was paid by a pro-Syrian government group, it set off a firestorm in the Democratic primary for Ohio governor. Former Gov. Ted Strickland, who supports Kucinich’s main rival Richard Cordray, accused Kucinich of trying to hide the $20,000 payment. "The fact that Dennis intentionally omitted his ties to these despicable individuals speaks volumes, I think, and it shows he knew these relationships were problematic," Strickland said during a conference call with reporters arranged by the Cordray campaign. In 2017, Kucinich was paid by the Association for Investment in Popular Action Committees to give a speech in England at an event hosted by the European Centre for the Study of Extremism. The California-based association is the parent of the Syria Solidarity Movement, which says it takes no sides about Bashar Hafez al-Assad but appears sympathetic to the Syrian president. Kucinich disputed Strickland’s characterization that he hid anything in an interview with Cleveland radio talk show host Mike Trivisonno. "There was no hiding," Kucinich said April 10. "I released it," adding, "I released the information. There’s no hiding here. I’ve never hid anything in my life." Time for PolitiFact to weigh in. Did Kucinich hide who paid him for a $20,000 speech about Syria? Kucinich’s speech has become a hot topic in the crowded Democratic May 8 primary for governor. Kucinich was asked to amend his financial disclosure On his April 9 financial disclosure form, Kucinich listed "paid speeches." Ohio Ethics Commission Executive Director Paul Nick sent Kucinich an April 13 letter asking him to identify the source of the paid speeches. Most filers must list every source of income and briefly describe the services they provided, according to the instructions. Kucinich provided additional information to the commission showing that he was paid $20,000 by the Association for Investment in Popular Action Committees. He also wrote that he received $10,000 from Nexus Earth and $3,000 from author Marianne Williamson. Kucinich said he went beyond the disclosure requirements. "I instantly not only said who I spoke to but I also said what the amount was, which I wasn’t required to do," he said in the radio interview. The amount of income is only required in some cases, such as if they were providing services to a lobbyist. Kucinich said that he should have included who paid him on his first filing. "I made a mistake," he said. "It was an omission. It was an error, but it wasn’t deliberate." Syria Solidarity Movement appears pro-Assad Kucinich has said that the conference was about peace. He posted an abstract of his 2017 speech, in which he said the West can’t impose its will on Syria. "The Syrian people, who are not unanimous on the question of President Assad, are resolute in protecting their way of life, which includes free education and free health care, while supporting the Assad government from a military overthrow which would destroy Syria." Paul Larudee, a steering committee member of the Syria Solidarity Movement, told PolitiFact that it doesn’t support Assad or any candidate. "We have no position on whether Assad should remain in power, and neither should the U.S. or your organization or anyone who is not Syrian," he said. "This is for Syrians to decide without interference or outside pressure." The Syria Solidarity Movement tries to cast doubt that Assad used a chemical attack and suggests the majority of Syrians support the Assad government. It includes articles with headlines such as "Voices from Syria: Assad is Essential for Syria’s Unity & Security." It calls for the West to not intervene and accuses human rights groups such as Doctors without Borders and Amnesty International of false allegations about the government in Syria. Robert S. Ford, former ambassador to Syria during the Obama administration and a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington, told PolitiFact he is certain that the Syrian government used chemical weapons. Ford said the Syria Solidarity Movement appears to be"vehemently pro-Assad government, denying regime war crimes." "They are trying to discredit the harder-line opposition (secular and Islamist both) while recommending that the world accept the Russian-mobilized Succhi dialogue process," he said. "That process aims to keep Assad now in return for promise of reforms at some later date." Kucinich has faced criticism in the past for meeting with Assad in 2017. His spokesman said that he held "fact-finding missions to find a way to end the violence." While in Congress, he opposed entering into war in Iraq and other military incursions. In April, Trump ordered a missile attack on Syria following reports that Assad’s regime used chemical attacks. Kucinich criticized that attack, stating that it "puts the U.S. on a path of military escalation with Russia, which opens wide the possibility of further miscalculations, errors or accidents that can ignite a world war." Our ruling Regarding his $20,000 speech about Syria, Kucinich said, "there was no hiding. I released it." But Kucinich initially listed "paid speeches" on his campaign financial disclosure form with no further detail. When the Ohio Ethics Commission asked him to identify the source of payments, Kucinich provided the commission with a list of the entities that paid him to give speeches, including $20,000 from the Association for Investment in Popular Action Committees. So Kucinich initially omitted the information, but disclosed it when asked to do so by a state commission. He also admitted that he made an error by not initially disclosing the source of who paid him for the speech. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-09018	The company I created, Point Judith Capital, "is the only venture capital firm in Rhode Island."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/jul/09/gina-raimondo/raimondo-says-hers-only-venture-capital-company-rh/	In her quest to become general treasurer, Democrat Gina Raimondo is stressing her Rhode Island roots and her financial experience. In a YouTube video available through her website, she talks about wanting to come back to the state to start a business. "I wanted to create a company, create a business, in Rhode Island. I could have chosen to put it elsewhere, but I wanted it in Providence. So I came home and created it. It's called Point Judith Capital, and it's the only venture capital firm in Rhode Island. I'm very proud of what we've built." Venture capitalists are people who raise money from entities such as private investors and public pension funds, and then invest it in start-up companies, hoping for a big return if those companies take off. It's a risky proposition, which is why there are not a lot of them around. But we thought Rhode Island had others besides Point Judith. So we called Richard G. Horan, senior managing director of the Slater Technology Fund, which also gives money to start-up companies. It turns out that there are other groups in Rhode Island that serve a similar function, but they are not truly venture capital firms in the strict sense, which supports Raimondo's claim. "There are others engaged in venture investment, but they have a different orientation," said Horan. Slater, for example, is publicly funded. It was created by the state in 1997 to stimulate the creation of new companies that focus on technology and is financed annually by the General Assembly. The Slater Fund typically invests up to a million dollars in "seed" money at the earliest stage of a company's development, with the expectation that a traditional venture capital firm, such as Raimondo's, will make a play to be involved in the company and provide the next round of funding. Another class, known as angel investors, also provides start-up money for promising businesses. They are represented in the state by the Cherrystone Angel Group. "They tend to be individual investors acting like investment clubs" and think of themselves as being in a separate class from venture capital firms, said Horan. Peter Dorsey, executive director of Cherrystone, agreed, explaining that his group, with 50 members, differs from a venture capital firm because it is not a committed fund, not professionally managed and doesn't have a paid staff. Finally, people often think of private equity firms, such as Providence Equity Partners, as being involved in venture capital, but they invest only in mature companies, he said. Providence Equity, for example, specializes in enterprises that deal with media, communications and information. So both Dorsey and Horan agree with Raimondo, who told The Providence Journal on Jan. 20 that she would quit Point Judith Capital if she is elected. Point Judith is "the one capital venture fund based here in Rhode Island," Horan said, adding that, "We need more. The Rhode Island entrepreneurial community would benefit greatly if other firms like Point Judith were established and operating here." So we rate Raimondo's claim as True.

pomt-09951	Judge Sotomayor has said "that policy is made on the U.S. Court of Appeals."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/26/republican-national-committee-republican/rnc-claims-supreme-court-nominee-sonia-sotomayor-s/	On the day President Barack Barack Obama announced Sonia Sotomayor as his Supreme Court nominee, many conservative opponents seized on a Sotomayor statement they say revealed her as someone who thinks judges make laws. While Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele struck a measured pose — saying Republicans would "reserve judgment on Sotomayor until there has been a thorough and thoughtful examination of her legal views" — the RNC also sent around a talking points memo to the press and hundreds of influential Republicans that claimed "Judge Sotomayor has also said that policy is made on the U.S. Court of Appeals." And Wendy E. Long, counsel to the Judicial Confirmation Network, called Sotomayor a "liberal judicial activist of the first order who thinks her own personal political agenda is more important than the law as written. She thinks that judges should dictate policy." The conservative blogosphere is full of similar sentiments, all based on the Sotomayor statement, "The Court of Appeals is where policy is made." So we decided to take a look at the context of Sotomayor's statement. It came during a presentation at Duke University in February 2005. Sotomayor was one of three judges who participated in a panel discussion for law students thinking about applying to be judicial law clerks. Snippets of Sotomayor's comments have been popular on YouTube; see the full, unedited video here (the pertinent part starts around the 43-minute mark). Sotomayor was asked about the differences between clerking for judges in the federal district courts as opposed to those in federal appeals court. "The Court of Appeals is where policy is made," said Sotomayor, a federal judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. "And I know this is on tape and I should never say that because we don't make law. I know … I know. (some laughs) I'm not promoting it. I'm not advocating it. I'm … you know. Okay. (more laughs) "Having said that, the Court of Appeals is where, before the Supreme Court makes the final decision, the law is percolating. It's interpretation. It's application." So keep in mind the audience and the question here, said Tom Goldstein, a partner at Washington law firm Akin Gump and the founder of ScotusBlog, a widely read blog on the Supreme Court. Goldstein watched the full video, and simply sees it as Sotomayor noting that in comparison to district court judges, "there's more policy involved" in the appeals courts. "The truth of the matter is, in the court of appeals, they are dealing with gaps and ambiguities in the law," Goldstein said. There's a lot for judges to interpret. Appeals court judges often have to make a call when a statute is unclear. In a sense, the policy is set by those calls made by the judges, even if they don't want to. To use that one line from Sotomayor to paint her as an activist judge is misleading, he said. "She's not a sweeping visionary ideologue in any way," Goldstein said. "Conservatives who are genuinely concerned about the direction of the Supreme Court, they are sort of grasping at straws here. That's an awful lot to put on one sentence." David Garrow, a historian who follows the Supreme Court, agrees. There has always been two schools of thought on the role of judges, Garrow said: those who see the law almost as an academic exercise, trying their best to mechanically apply the law; and the legal realists, who believe interpreting the law involves making choices, discretion. "What she (Sotomayor) said there is simply the honest version of what any judge knows and realizes," Garrow said. But "you're not really supposed to acknowledge it on the record." It's unfair to extrapolate that comment to suggest Sotomayor would mandate policy, he said. "To anyone who knows the intellectual history of judicial decisionmaking, she's just being honest, not activist," Garrow said. In short, the quote in question is the first line of a larger discussion about the differences between clerking for a district court rather than an appeals court judge. And Sotomayor goes on to detail those differences. In full context, it's clear that she is making the point that there are more decisions about interpreting and applying policy at the appeals court level. To the extent that the RNC raises the point to suggest it means she would be an activist judge on the Supreme Court, we think that's misleading. Sotomayor even noted that judges don't make law, that she was talking about interpreting and applying it. And so we rule the RNC's statement Half True.

pomt-05158	"More than 43 percent of all food stamps are given to illegals."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/19/facebook-posts/facebook-post-says-more-43-percent-all-food-stamps/	A reader recently sent us a Facebook post with "10 Illegal Alien Facts." One of them was that "more than 43 percent of all food stamps are given to illegals." We decided to take a look -- and quickly found the claim was preposterous. In March 2012, the most recent month for which figures are available, a total of 46.4 million people received food stamps, so 43 percent of that number would be slightly less than 20 million. For obvious reasons, the numbers of illegal immigrants is much trickier to track. However, the most widely accepted number comes from the Pew Hispanic Center, which estimated that there were 11.2 million illegal immigrants in the United States in 2010. So it’s mathematically impossible for more than 43 percent of all food stamps to be given to illegals -- there simply aren’t enough undocumented immigrants in the country to make the math work. Nor does the math work if you choose a month before the number of food stamp recipients rose due to the recession. In October 2008, there were 30.8 million recipients; 43 percent of that number is 13.2 million, which exceeded the total number of illegal immigrants at the time, 11.6 million. None of this even takes into account an even more basic reality: It is against the law for Illegal immigrants to receive food stamps and the government has a process to verify immigration status. Citizen children of illegal immigrants can qualify (there are 3.5 million, according to Pew) but that's not enough to make the math work. Is it possible some illegal immigrants receive food stamps anyway? Sure. But even if every single one somehow managed to fool the government, it still wouldn't be enough to account for the 43 percent. Our rating The first of the Facebook post’s 10 claims -- that "more than 43 percent of all food stamps are given to illegals" -- is ridiculously false. It isn’t mathematically possible given the number of illegal immigrants in the United States, and it ignores the fact that illegal immigrants can’t even receive food stamps legally. Pants on Fire!

pomt-10081	"And 100 percent, John, of your ads . . . 100 percent of them have been negative."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/dec/03/barack-obama/no-mccains-ads-havent-all-been-negative/	(Published Oct. 15, 2008) One of the more pointed exchanges between Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain in the third and final debate on Oct. 15, 2008, was over the topic of negative ads. Here’s how one exchange went: Obama: "And 100 percent, John, of your ads — 100 percent of them have been negative." McCain: "It’s not true." Obama: "It absolutely is true." (You can find the exchange on the YouTube version about 26:30 into the debate.) Obama appears to be cherry-picking the ads run during a single week — from Sept. 28 to Oct. 4 — during which the Wisconsin Advertising Project found "nearly all" of McCain’s ads were negative. That week, they found that 34 percent of Obama’s ads were negative. But McCain has aired many, many ads that were not negative. If you look at a report from the same organization on Sept. 17, they found that in the week after the conventions, for example, Obama aired a higher percentage of negative ads than did McCain (76 percent to 56 percent). In all, the Wisconsin Advertising Project has found that 73 percent of McCain’s ads have been negative, to date. That's far short of 100 percent. (It also found 61 percent of Obama’s ads have been negative.) That’s up for both parties from the 2004 election, when 64 percent of George Bush’s ads were negative, compared to 34 percent of John Kerry’s. So Obama might be right for one week, but he is way off for the overall campaign, when McCain's negative ads accounted for 73 percent. That's so far off that we find it Pants on Fire wrong.

pomt-06640	"$360 million of our tax dollars went straight to ... the Taliban."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/sep/15/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-says-360-million-taxpayer-dollars-wen/	Democratic ex-congressman Alan Grayson is talking about the Taliban again. The first time -- when he not-so-subtly compared his opponent in the 2010 election to the Taliban -- didn't work so well. See, previous paragraph (i.e., ex). But Grayson is back, preparing to run for Congress after losing to Republican Dan Webster. In an e-mail to supporters (subject line: "Iraq: I Did My Part") on Sept. 1, 2011, Grayson wrote about the Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan, which released its final report on prevalent waste and fraud among taxpayer-paid contractors in those countries. The bipartisan commission determined the U.S. government lost between $31 billion and $60 billion to waste and fraud as a result of ineffective oversight of contract spending. Grayson elaborated in his e-mail: "In fact, $360 million of our tax dollars went straight to ... the Taliban. Wow. Who could have imagined that? Well ... me." The rest of Grayson's note details how he revitalized a Civil War-era law that allows people to file lawsuits in the name of the federal government, a move that attracted attention from the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN and Wall Street Journal (he included links). He wrote that he voted against the wars, was a vocal opponent of them while in office and provided breakdowns of the war's toll on taxpayers. His point? He did something against the wars. But did he also make a false claim? Of all his figures, his statement that the United States sent $360 million "straight to the Taliban" was the most striking. It didn't take long to turn up what he was talking about. Grayson was referencing an Aug. 16, 2011, story by the Associated Press that preceded the commission's in-depth report. The AP reported that an investigation by a military task force found that $360 million in taxpayer money meant to strengthen Afghanistan's economy ended up going to "the Taliban, criminals and power brokers with ties to both." It happened through a process called "reverse money laundering." The AP explained it like this: American money starts out clean as it is given to companies hired by the military for transportation, construction, fuel and other projects. But the funds become "tainted" -- landing in the hands of crime groups and the Taliban -- either by direct payments or through the network of subcontractors. The Taliban and insurgent groups only reaped a "small percentage" of this $360 million, an anonymous Kabul-based military official told the AP. Most of the money was lost to profiteering, bribery and extortion by criminals and power brokers. About half of the lost money stemmed from a large transportation contract called Host Nation Trucking, comprised of eight prime companies that hired nearly three dozen subcontractors to transport supplies to U.S. troops in Afghan bases. Those subcontractors then paid off insurgents or warlords who control the roads. The task force found that one of the prime contractors, HEB International Logistics, made direct payments to "malign actors," the designation given to the network of corrupt Afghan government and business officials, criminals and insurgents. The work of the military task force ran "parallel" with the research of the wartime contracting commission, commission spokesman Clark Irwin said. But the military's findings have not been publicly made available (at least as far as we can tell). The wartime contracting commission's report, however, is a publicly available document. That report does not peg a specific dollar figure on moneys lost to the Taliban and other criminal groups. It notes, however, that extortion of U.S. transportation and construction project money is the second-largest source of revenue for insurgent groups, behind the drug trade (pages 73-4). From the report: "In Iraq and Afghanistan, U.S. funds have been diverted to insurgents and warlords as a cost of doing business in the country. In Afghanistan, insurgents, warlords, or other groups control or contest parts of the country. They threaten to destroy projects and harm personnel. The Commission finds it particularly alarming that Afghan subcontractors on U.S.-funded convoys, road construction, and development projects pay insurgent groups for protection." We asked the member of the commission who wrote that excerpt and an expert on the issue, University of Baltimore government contracting professor Charles Tiefer, for his opinion on Grayson's statement. There was no unclassified amount for money diverted to the Taliban until recently, Tiefer said, but the $360 million figure is credible based on information he gained while on a trip to Kandahar in March and the commission's conclusions. "That figure is consistent with it being the insurgent's second-largest funding source," he said, noting that finding a precise number would be nearly impossible. Tiefer went on to compliment Grayson, saying he "was among the first lawyers to discuss publicly the scale of contracting waste in Iraq -- I never talked to him but I read what he had to say -- so, I think he has more right than most congressmen to pronounce on this issue." Grayson, reached by e-mail, said he received further information on the subject from military briefings during his time in Congress, congressional delegation trips and several whistle-blower clients who worked for contractors in Afghanistan, "none of which, unfortunately, I am allowed to share with you, except to say that the figure is corroborated," he wrote. Here's what we know: Grayson correctly quoted a figure from a national story about U.S. money being diverted to "the Taliban, criminals and power brokers with ties to both." A member of the Commission on Wartime Contracting -- and an expert in the field of government contracting -- found this information credible based on extensive research. But Grayson's statement comes with two minor caveats. He said that tax dollars went "straight to ... the Taliban." The process is actually more complicated and involved a type of money laundering. And the money went to bad actors other than the Taliban in some cases. Those are noteworthy clarifications and enough to rate Grayson's statement Mostly True.

pomt-05894	"Since ObamaCare and the stimulus passed, the unemployment rate in the U.S. has increased."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/06/pete-koekstra/debbie-spend-it-now-ad-pete-hoekstra-errs-unemploy/	On Feb. 5, 2012, former Rep. Pete Hoekstra -- a Republican seeking to unseat Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich. -- released an ad titled "Debbie-Spend-It-Now." The ad quickly attracted public attention for its use of a young Asian woman thanking Americans, in broken English, for helping to boost the Chinese economy. The ad directed viewers to a website that provided additional statistical details. One of the claims on the site is that "since ObamaCare and the stimulus passed, the unemployment rate in the U.S. has increased." We decided to see whether that claim was correct. The stimulus was the first of the two bills to be signed into law -- on Feb. 17, 2009. That month, the national unemployment rate stood at 8.3 percent. Meanwhile, the health care law was signed on March 23, 2010. During that month, the national unemployment rate was 9.8 percent. And in the most recent month for which figures are available -- January 2012 -- the unemployment rate stood at 8.3 percent. So, since enactment of the stimulus three years ago, the unemployment rate has -- after a rise and then a decline -- remained at exactly the same rate. And since the health care legislation was passed, it has fallen by 1.5 percentage points. We should note some fine print. The source for the claim on the website is "Bureau of Labor Statistics, Accessed 1/23/2012" -- a time before the latest decline in the unemployment rate. The rate on that date was 8.5 percent, but it dropped to 8.3 percent by the time the ad aired on Super Bowl weekend. Using the December figure makes the comparison for the stimulus correct, though the comparison for the health care law still would have been incorrect. Either way, though, it’s not the current figure. Our ruling Neither time span offered in Hoekstra’s website checks out, based on the unemployment rate on the day the ad first aired. One shows that the unemployment rate is the same now as it was when the stimulus passed (although it went up in the interim). The other shows that the rate has fallen since the health care law passed. We rate the statement False. EDITOR’S NOTE: After we published this story, a reader asked us to evaluate Hoekstra’s claim from the perspective of Michigan, where he’s running for Senate. So we did. In February 2009, when the stimulus was signed, unemployment in Michigan was 12.0 percent. In March 2010, when the health care bill was signed, the rate was 13.3 percent. In December 2011 -- the most recent month available -- the rate was 9.3 percent. So the declines in unemployment over both time spans were actually steeper in Michigan than they were nationally. We are keeping our rating at False.	None	Pete Hoekstra	None	None	None	2012-02-06T14:53:08	2012-02-05	['United_States']
pomt-08422	"Ted Strickland destroyed Ohio jobs when he busted the budget."	false	/ohio/statements/2010/oct/19/john-kasich/kasich-ad-puts-all-states-budget-woes-job-loses-st/	Republicans have made jobs the central theme of the campaign, and "400,000" -- an aptly titled TV ad from GOP gubernatorial candidate John Kasich -- dutifully delivers its refrain: "Under Ted Strickland as governor, Ohio has lost nearly 400,000 jobs." PolitiFact Ohio earlier rated that claim as Half True. We found it did not reflect the larger economic backdrop of a national recession and a steady loss of Ohio jobs since January 2000. We found the claim broke down at the suggestion that the governor, or any one official, is responsible for the job losses. But the pitchman in "400,000," a burly fellow with a white hardhat tucked under his arm, goes a step further. He says: "Ted Strickland destroyed Ohio jobs when he busted the budget and raised our taxes to help pay for his mistakes." That's a mouthful. PolitiFact Ohio bit off a piece of it earlier, when we examined Kasich's charge that Strickland raised taxes on Ohioans, a charge the Democratic governor has vehemently denied. Strickland says he didn’t raise taxes -- he only froze the final year of a five-year, 21-percent income tax cut that started in 2005. That move, narrowly approved by the Republican-controlled Ohio Senate, saved the state approximately $840 million. Strickland insists the only alternative was to cut the money from primary and secondary education. But there are no guarantees that the tax cut will be unfrozen next year. Taxpayers, who had to pay more in income taxes for 2009 than they had expected, may continue to pay at the higher rate. That’s why PolitiFact Ohio rated Kasich’s statement as Mostly True. But what about the first part of the statement, which we take up now. How did the governor destroy Ohio jobs? What does "busted the budget" mean? And what were Strickland's "mistakes"? We asked the Kasich campaign. This was the answer from press secretary Rob Nichols: "He tried to fill the $850 million hole with slot machines and racetracks. And that didn't work. So he reneged on his pledge not to raise taxes, to the tune of $840 million, in a recession, in the worst economy since the Depression." That still didn’t tell us what "busted the budget" means, or how Strickland busted it. Ohio law requires the state budget be balanced, and the governor shares authority and responsibility for it with the General Assembly. A share of the blame for the $850 million shortfall, or hole, can be pinned on Republicans, who were in power in the General Assembly while spending increased seven consecutive budgets while taxes were cut. House Speaker Armond Buddish, a Democrat, recently chided Republicans for not paying for their tax cuts, a claim PolitiFact Ohio found Mostly True. Democrats, he said, "made the cuts that Republicans wouldn’t" slicing almost $2 billion from the current $50.5 billion general revenue fund budget. Strickland did propose installing slot machines at horse racing tracks, a plan he said would have brought the state almost $1 billion. That plan -- which the legislature agreed to put in the budget bill -- was killed by a lawsuit from a group of conservative activists called LetOhioVote. That doesn't make the plan a mistake. It still could be adopted. When lawmakers draft a new two-year budget next year will have to find some source of revenue, or chop programs. They won’t have nearly $5 billion in one-time money that helped balance the current budget. Finally, the claim that Strickland destroyed Ohio jobs amounts to political hyperbole. Ohio and other industrial states all hemorrhaged jobs when the economy hit the skids, and the causes of the recession are much broader than just the state’s budget woes. So where does that leave us? The ad pins all of Ohio’s budget woes on Strickland, when no one person is responsible for the state’s budget. As governor, Strickland must work with the legislature to get a budget approved. The bottom line is that the budget wasn’t busted, it was balanced. The ad labels an effort to fill the budget hole via slot machines at Ohio’s horse tracks as a mistake by Strickland, although the legislature went along with the idea. The ad pins Ohio’s job losses on the governor, claiming they were a result of those state budget woes.

pomt-14808	"More black babies are aborted in NYC than born."	true	/texas/statements/2015/nov/25/cynthia-meyer/cynthia-meyer-says-more-black-babies-are-aborted-n/	During the first Democratic presidential debate in October 2015, Hillary Clinton proclaimed, "We’ve got to be committed to getting every child to live up to his or her God-given potential." Cynthia Meyer, who took up the post of deputy press secretary for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton in early 2015, fired back with a tweet, "Would help if they had the chance to be born." About a month later, in the next Democratic debate Nov. 14, 2015, the episode was repeated. Clinton echoed her earlier comment, again declaring, "Every single one of our children deserves the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential." This time, Meyer responded by tweeting, "More black babies are aborted in NYC than born," followed by the hashtag #blacklivesmatter. NYC meaning the city of New York. The pair of exchanges elicited a strong sense of deja vu, but Meyer’s second tweet raised a more specific question about abortion rates among black women in the Big Apple: Are there more abortions by black women in NYC than births? To our inquiry, over email Meyer said her responses were an effort to highlight the value of human life and call attention to NYC’s "startling" numbers, which come from a 2013 report on pregnancy outcomes compiled by the city’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene’s Bureau of Vital Statistics. The numbers have been widely reported by conservative media outlets, including a National Review article that Meyer emailed to us. "To be clear, that tweet came from my personal Twitter account and I was speaking as a private citizen," Meyer said in an email. "Happy to defend the stats, though." Abortions by black women in NYC outpacing births? Figuring out the answer to this question proved rather simple. The first place we went was that 2013 report, the most recent data available, which provides exhaustive breakdowns of birth statistics in New York City. The agency lists pregnancy outcomes by race and ethnicity, as well as by borough, type of birth (live birth, C-section, premature) and health of the mother. According to the report, in 2013 black women accounted for 29,007 terminated pregnancies, representing almost 42 percent of all abortions in the city. That same year, black women in the city gave birth to 24,108 babies. With abortions surpassing live births by nearly 5,000, African American women in the city clearly terminated pregnancies more often than they carried babies to term. Black women terminated pregnancies at a rate of 67.3 per 1,000 women ages 15 to 49, a rate far higher than any other racial or ethnic group. We checked: the statistics were similar the previous year, when African American women in the city had 24,758 births and underwent 31,328 abortions. The numbers for black women in NYC starkly contrasted with women in other racial and ethnic categories. In 2013, births far surpassed abortions for white, Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander women. Hispanic women accounted for the second-most abortions in the city with 21,555, but they also had 35,581 live births. Asian women had both the fewest abortions and fewest births, while white women accounted for the most births overall and second-fewest abortions. There was less discrepancy between the number of births and terminated pregnancies for black women statewide. In 2013, black women in New York state gave birth to 36,130 babies and underwent 34,960 abortions, according to the state’s health department. During the previous year, the numbers were almost dead even, with black women accounting for 36,905 births and 36,633 abortions across the state. The numbers are far different for the four biggest cities in Texas. The Texas Department of State Health Services reports births by both county and city, but abortions are only reported by county. We examined the numbers in 2013 for Bexar, Dallas, Harris and Travis Counties, which contain the cities of San Antonio, Dallas, Houston and Austin, respectively. In all four counties, black women had more live births than abortions. The same was true for white women in those counties. For Harris County, which includes Houston, the largest city in Texas and fourth-largest city nationwide, black women had 12,569 live births and 5,515 abortions, while white women accounted for 16,247 births and 2,661 abortions. If you’d like to peruse the numbers for all four counties, we input the data into a Google spreadsheet for easier side-by-side comparison. It’s important to note that abortion access across the state of Texas stands in stark contrast to NYC. Texas currently has 19 operating abortion clinics, but that number would drop to 10 if the U.S. Supreme Court allows the state's contested 2013 law to fully take effect. In contrast, New York state has 80 abortion clinics. Attitudes toward abortion also differ greatly between the two states. Nationally in 2009, black women had abortions far more often than white and Hispanic women, according to data compiled in December 2013 by the National Center for Health Statistics. For some perspective, an online search turned up a 2008 Guttmacher Policy Review article by Susan A. Cohen, a vice president for the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that promotes reproductive health and abortion rights. Cohen, saying the national abortion rate for black women is almost five times the rate for white women, suggested this is greatly explained by higher incidences of unintended pregnancy among African American residents. Higher rates, Cohen wrote, "reflect the particular difficulties that many women in minority communities face in accessing high-quality contraceptive services and in using their chosen method of birth control consistently and effectively over long periods of time. Moreover, these realities must be seen in a larger context in which significant racial and ethnic disparities persist for a wide range of health outcomes, from diabetes to heart disease to breast and cervical cancer to sexually transmitted infections (STI), including HIV." In examining the socioeconomic factors behind this phenomena, Cohen disputed the idea that black women are recruited into having more abortions, a sentiment that has been shared by anti-abortion activists and conservative politicians. These issues were also extensively explored last September by Zoe Dutton in a piece for The Atlantic called "Abortion’s Racial Gap." GOP leaders have used these statistics to argue against abortion, positing that it disproportionately affects black communities. In August, Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson articulated this stance in relation to Planned Parenthood, claiming during an appearance on Fox News that the organization has contributed to abortion being "the number one cause of death for black people." The leading causes of death for black Americans are actually heart disease, cancer and stroke, according to the CDC, but Carson’s rhetoric speaks to the GOP’s broader stance against abortion. The debate over abortion has taken on more fervor in recent years as many states have introduced increased abortion restrictions. Texas has led in this area, in 2013 enacting a law requiring abortion clinics to adhere to the standards of surgical centers and employ doctors with admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic. In November 2015, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case challenging the constitutionality of those two provisions as undue burdens on women seeking abortions. Our ruling: A Hillary Clinton declaration that every child should be allowed to live up to his potential prompted a tweet from a spokeswoman for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton that "More black babies are aborted in NYC than born." The tweet from Deputy Press Secretary Cynthia Meyer echoes what has become a talking point among anti-abortion activists, that abortion disproportionately affects the nation’s African American population. Nationally, African American women had a higher rate of abortion than whites, Hispanics or Asians, according to 2013 figures. Even so, black women gave birth more than they terminated pregnancies that year. The same was not true for New York City, where more abortions were recorded for black woman than live births in both 2012 and 2013, the most recent available data. We rate this claim True. TRUE -- The statement is accurate and there's nothing significant missing. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. CLARIFICATION, 4:20 p.m., Dec. 1, 2015: We amended this fact check to clarify that the described 2013 abortion rate for black women related to women aged 15 to 49.

pomt-08617	"Kasich’s trade deals cost Ohio thousands of jobs - 49,000 jobs to Mexico, 91,000 to China."	false	/ohio/statements/2010/sep/21/ted-strickland/gov-ted-strickland-ties-ohios-job-losses-john-kasi/	Gov. Ted Strickland's re-election campaign hasn't wavered from the message that his Republican opponent, John Kasich, cost Ohio jobs when he was a congressman by supporting the North American Free Trade Agreement and overseas trade deals, especially with China. A Strickland TV ad, "Truth," sticks to the theme with claims that have been posted on the campaign's website: "Kasich’s trade deals cost Ohio thousands of jobs - 49,000 jobs to Mexico, 91,000 to China." The ad says voting for NAFTA, which took effect in 1994 and eliminated most trade barriers between Canada, Mexico and the United States, cost the state 49,000 jobs to Mexico. It says 91,000 Ohio jobs were lost to China because of Kasich’s vote in 2000 to normalize trade relations with China. We wondered if the effect of the trade deals on jobs was so clear-cut - and if the numbers can be determined so specifically. Calculating job losses and gains is not a simple matter of counting heads. The ad's estimate of job losses tied to NAFTA comes from a 2006 study by the Economic Policy Institute, a pro-union think tank that has long been critical of NAFTA. The study did not, however, claim to count actual job losses. Extrapolating from employment, census and trade data, it estimated how many jobs might have been supported by production that the study says was "displaced" by growing U.S. trade deficits with Canada and Mexico. There are other complications. The nonpartisan General Accounting Office said that job losses were overestimated, because some NAFTA imports displaced imports from other countries instead of production in the U.S. Both the Congressional Budget Office and the Congressional Research Service concluded that factors other than NAFTA caused the widening trade deficit with Mexico. And the Congressional Research Service, evaluating studies by the Congressional Budget Office, the World Bank, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the U.S. International Trade Commission, found that none attributed changes in employment levels to NAFTA. The estimate of jobs lost to China carries virtually identical problems. The figure also comes from EPI, through a study published this year. It also is based on "displaced production" resulting from trade imbalance, and not on a tally of actual job losses. Further clouding the estimate is the effect that other economic policies and forces - including product dumping, price controls and currency manipulation - have on the trade imbalance. The effect of normalized trade relations cannot be isolated. Kasich did vote for NAFTA in the House of Representatives in 1993 and for normalizing trade relations with China in 2000. Labeling them as "Kasich’s trade deals," as does the ad, is a stretch, though. The Clinton administration supported NAFTA, and 102 Democrats joined Republicans voting for the agreement, which the House approved 234 to 200. Clinton also fought for the Chinese trade bill, which the House passed with 164 Republican and 73 Democratic votes. Strickland, who was also in Congress, voted against both measures. So in the end, here’s what we’re left with: The ad makes claims about jobs lost, but relies on studies that didn’t actually count jobs that were lost. The estimates in those studies of what might have been displaced are affected by factors beyond NAFTA and trade with China, making it virtually impossible to measure the specific impact of either agreement on Ohio. The ad labels NAFTA and the Chinese trade bill as "Kasich’s deals," although he was just one of many members of Congress to vote for them, and both received support from Democrats and Republicans.

pomt-14139	"Seven hundred thousand. That’s how many California jobs will be lost thanks to the politicians raising the minimum wage….Now Florida is adding one million jobs, not losing them."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/may/04/enterprise-florida/florida-agencys-misleading-attack-californias-mini/	Florida Gov. Rick Scott is not on board with the minimum wage increase in the sunny, oceanside state — of California. As Scott toured the West Coast for the second time attempting to attract businesses, Enterprise Florida (the state’s public-private economic development arm) ran radio ads in San Francisco and Los Angeles attacking California’s $15 wage and trumpeting Florida’s superior job prospects. "Seven hundred thousand. That’s how many California jobs will be lost thanks to the politicians raising the minimum wage," the ad says, as the Miami Herald reports. "Ready to leave California? Go to Florida instead — no state income tax, and Gov. Scott has cut regulations. Now Florida is adding 1 million jobs, not losing them." California Gov. Jerry Brown didn’t take this lying down, penning a letter welcoming Scott back to California, "a state that in the last year has added more jobs than Florida and Texas combined," and not-so-subtly suggested Scott worry about more pressing matters back home. "Rick, a fact you’d like to ignore: California is the 7th largest economic power in the world. We’re competing with nations like Brazil and France, not states like Florida," Brown wrote on May 2. "If you’re truly serious about Florida’s economic well-being, it’s time to stop the silly political stunts and start doing something about climate change – two words you won’t even let state officials say. The threat is real and so too will be the devastating impacts." Here, we’ll look at Scott’s claim that California will lose almost as many jobs as Florida will gain. The ad is comparing California's projected employment with Florida's past performance — an apples-to-oranges comparison. It also distorts what the 700,000 jobs-lost figure actually refers to. Even with the wage hike, California is expected to gain more jobs than Florida over the next decade, albeit not as many as without it. Furthermore, all the economists we spoke with cautioned against pinning a figure to the minimum wage hike’s impact on employment in California. All that glitters in Golden State jobs A spokesperson for Scott cited a post by American Action Forum, a self-described center-right policy institute, as the source of the 700,000 lost jobs. But the figure doesn’t refer to a decline in the total number jobs in the state, as the ad suggests. Rather, it’s the difference between the number of jobs that California could have gained without and with the wage hike. California will gradually increase the current $10 hourly minimum wage to $15 by 2022. According to the institute's labor market policy director, Ben Gitis, that will lead to a 3.5 percent decrease in employment growth or about 692,235 jobs by 2026 that could have been added if the wage did not increase. Gitis walked us through his math. He used the California Employment Development Department’s latest 10-year forecast, which projects that the state will add 14.9 percent or 2.3 million more jobs from 2012 to 2022. Gitis then calculated the impact of the minimum wage hike; he concluded that California would see its projected 2026 jobs numbers reduced by 3.5 percent. In other words, California would have added about 3.4 million new jobs from 2012 to 2026 without the hike, but 2.7 million with it. So the state isn’t so much "losing" 700,000 jobs as "forgoing" them, said Jeremy West, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who co-authored the Journal of Human Resources study Gitis used for his calculations. Bright employment outlook in Sunshine State Scott’s office forwarded us a press release that says Florida has added more than a million jobs since 2010, a claim that PolitiFact Florida rated Mostly True. But Scott was talking about future projections for California, so we’ll look instead at the number of jobs Florida will gain in the same time frame as Gitis’ analysis. From 2012 to 2026, Florida is actually projected to add more than a million jobs. The increase, however, will still be less than California’s. (We would be remiss to not mention that California’s cost of living is higher than Florida's and its population size is almost twice as big. But as Enterprise Florida touted raw employment numbers, we’ll follow suit.) Florida added about 552,000 jobs from Dec. 2012 to Dec. 2015. According to the Florida Dept. of Economic Opportunity, the state will gain 1.1 million more jobs from 2015 to 2023. That’s a compounded annual growth rate of 1.5 percent, equal to about 445,000 new jobs from 2023 to 2026. Put it all together, Florida will add 2.1 million jobs from 2012 to 2026. That’s still 600,000 fewer jobs than California will add in the same time frame with the $15 wage. Waging in uncharted waters As we have previously reported, there’s a great amount of debate over the effect that minimum wage hikes have job growth. A spokesperson for Brown forwarded us academic and think-tank studies showing that past increases have had little or no effect on employment. California’s hike, however, is so unprecedented that past research may be less relevant. All the experts we spoke with suspect it will reduce employment. "An increase the size of California’s is outside of the experience of any state over the last four decades," said Jonathan Meer, a Texas A&M University economist and co-author of the study Gitis cited. "A dramatic increase in the minimum wage like California’s will undoubtedly reduce employment. However, I would be very cautious about putting any precise figures on the amount." Two home-state economists — Jeffrey Clemens of the University of California, San Diego and David Neumark of the University of California, Irvine — agreed that the huge wage hike will likely cause job losses, but the magnitude is uncertain. "The recently passed minimum wage increases are sufficiently beyond the range of historical experience that I do not think it is possible to predict their effects on employment with any precision," Clemens said. Neumark added that Scott’s job-poaching mission is nonetheless ill-fated, given that the flow of jobs into or out of California is typically miniscule and the jobs most affected by hike (low-skill jobs in the service and agricultural sectors) are hard to move out of state. "Maybe a few low-wage manufacturers will move. But there's no reason to expect they'd go to Florida more than many other low-wage states or overseas, so I suspect the employment growth in Florida from California’s minimum wage increase would be negligible, and statistically undetectable," Neumark said. "So Gov. Scott is probably wasting his and his Florida taxpayers' time." Our ruling A radio ad by Enterprise Florida said, "Seven hundred thousand. That’s how many California jobs will be lost thanks to the politicians raising the minimum wage….Now Florida is adding 1 million jobs, not losing them." This is misleading. The 700,000 figure refers to the number of jobs California could have added by 2026 if it didn’t increase the minimum wage, not a decline in net employment. Based on projections, California will still gain more jobs with the minimum wage increase than Florida during the same time frame. While experts agreed that a $15 wage will reduce employment in California, they said it’s near impossible to pin a number on the impact given how unprecedented the hike is. We rate the claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/22054202-4acc-431a-9397-5400fc73d984	None	Enterprise Florida	None	None	None	2016-05-04T10:40:08	2016-04-27	['California']
pomt-13481	Says Ron Johnson gave himself a $10 million 'sweetheart corporate payout'	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/sep/09/russ-feingold/did-ron-johnson-approve-10m-bonus-himself/	Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson has touted his private-sector experience in his 2016 re-election bid, just as he did in 2010. But it’s a big final payday his opponent wants you to remember. Russ Feingold invoked the matter in a campaign ad in June. Then again in early July. And again in late July. The central claim in all three is that Johnson gave himself a $10 million payout when he left his Oshkosh manufacturing firm after winning the 2010 election. The ads imply there’s something shady about the payment, particularly one launched June 14, 2016. Black and white images of Johnson, the U.S. Capitol and cash fill the screen as a narrator ominously states: "Before Sen. Johnson left for Washington, he gave himself $10 million, a sweetheart corporate payout." Was such a payment made, and, if so, is there anything questionable about it? Let’s dig in. Johnson’s $10 million At issue is money Johnson received shortly before taking office in 2011. It came to light in a federal Financial Disclosure Report that listed the payment as compensation from Pacur, the company he helped found and bought in 1997. Johnson told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s Dan Bice in 2011 the payment was back pay for serving as CEO the previous 13 years, as he had not taken a paycheck since purchasing the company. Johnson sold most of the company in 2010 and stopped active involvement in its operations, though he retains a 5 percent stake, according to campaign spokesman William Allison. Johnson hasn’t gone into much detail on the nature of the payout, saying at the time, "It's a private business. I've complied with all the disclosure laws, and I don't have to explain it any further to someone like you." The column noted the pay didn’t appear to be part of a pre-determined compensation package. Johnson described the payment in 2011 as an "agreed-upon amount," then acknowledged the person who agreed to it was the owner — himself. Allison said Pacur followed "followed standard business practices to settle the account and independently calculate the back pay (Johnson) was owed as a result." He said the payout was reviewed as part of a routine IRS audit and the IRS "took no issue with it." Allison declined to elaborate on the process by which the $10 million amount was decided and approved. So Johnson received $10 million. Does that make it a "sweetheart corporate payout" as the ad claims? That’s a pretty subjective description, but it implies there was something special or unusual about the amount. When considered as back pay, the $10 million works out to about $770,000 per year. That would be a "fairly typical" compensation package for an owner and CEO of a company the size of Pacur, according to a blog post last year in Plastics News. The trade publication does an annual executive pay study for the plastics industry, though it noted it had to estimate the size of Pacur since the private company does not release sales information. David Walker, a professor and executive compensation expert at Boston University School of Law, said that annual amount "doesn’t seem implausible," for someone in Johnson’s position, since many owners of small businesses take out most of the profits as compensation. But like other experts contacted by PolitiFact Wisconsin, Walker said it’s hard to put the amount in context since Pacur is a private company, so we don’t know key factors like its size, profits and other executive compensation. The timing of Johnson’s payment is also noteworthy, though it’s not directly addressed in any of Feingold’s ads. The original column points out the $10 million payment came on the heels of a campaign where Johnson spent $9 million of his own money. Critics said the payout looked like an attempt to circumvent federal regulations and have the company pay for Johnson’s campaign. Corporations are not allowed to contribute directly to federal or state campaigns, and they can’t give money to a candidate for the express purpose of reimbursing campaign costs. The Federal Election Commission never issued a public finding regarding the payment to Johnson. A group claimed to have submitted a complaint last year, but an FEC spokeswoman said it the agency never received it. Election lawyers told Bice in 2011 that Johnson likely didn’t violate any election laws, and proving otherwise would have required a written agreement or other direct proof of a prior plan to reimburse campaign expenses. Such proof never surfaced. Our rating In a recent TV ad, Feingold claims Johnson gave himself $10 million in a "sweetheart corporate payout." The amount is accurate, and Johnson did essentially give it to himself since he acknowledged he was the one to approve it. But there’s no evidence to show this payment was unusual or out of line, as the tone and use of the "sweetheart" descriptor imply. An industry trade publication said the amount is reasonable given Johnson’s role and longevity. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, our rating is Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/00cdbff3-5150-48b7-bcf4-12e5fdd5fc83	None	Russ Feingold	None	None	None	2016-09-09T10:30:00	2016-06-14	['None']
pomt-01786	Oregon "is the most trade-dependent state in the nation"	false	/oregon/statements/2014/jul/25/john-kitzhaber/oregon-most-trade-dependent-state-nation/	Gov. John Kitzhaber’s first debate with Republican challenger state Rep. Dennis Richardson covered a lot of ground, with both candidates spending considerable time on economic issues. Their exchanges made clear that the economy will continue to be a pivotal issue as the campaign heads toward the November election. The claim: Kitzhaber, a Democrat seeking a historic fourth term in office, touted his job-creation work and said his policies have helped stabilize the state’s budget. Looking ahead, he said, the state has untapped gold in the form of international trade possibilities. Then Kitzhaber added this: "We are the most trade-dependent state in the nation." PolitiFact Oregon decided to check. The analysis: We called Christian Gaston, a policy adviser for the governor’s campaign. He was sitting in the front row at the debate and said the claim caught his ear as well. In a subsequent email, Gaston said, "The governor misspoke. He meant to say that Oregon is one of the most trade-dependent states in the nation." The latter claim is one Kitzhaber has made before, Gaston said. His email included a YouTube link to an interview in December 2013 in which the governor does say "is one of" the most trade-dependent states. For context, we looked at where Oregon ranks. "Determining trade dependence is extremely difficult," said Robert Whelan, an economist with ECONorthwest, a Portland-based company that provides economic analyses and professional consulting services to public and private entities. "It’s one area that cannot be absolutely checked." For instance, Whelan said, Oregon exports about $1.6 billion worth of chemicals a year, much of that in soda ash and potash. "Most people would see that figure and say, ‘Wow,’" Whelan said, "‘where’s the chemical factory?’ Well, there isn’t any. It’s mined elsewhere, brought in by rail and shipped. But it shows up as an export." All of the products made at a Boeing plant near Gresham, on the other hand, are hauled to Seattle, where they are finished and shipped. Those are counted as Washington exports, not Oregon. Still, Whelan said, "there’s no way to say we are the most trade-dependent, but we are certainly one of them." The value of exports from Oregon to foreign countries this year will be about $19 billion, a figure that ranks 23rd among the 50 states, according to International Trade Association statistics. A trade study released in 2010 by the Portland Business Alliance ranked Oregon seventh nationally in the share exports hold -- 12 percent -- of the state’s economy. A more recent study prepared for the same group indicates that nearly 80,000 jobs in Oregon are directly tied to exporting goods and services, with one in four manufacturing jobs in the state being export-related. Those same numbers are far larger in states that dwarf Oregon in terms of population. But according to the Portland Business Alliance’s study, Oregon exports ranked seventh on a per capita basis in 2013. The ruling: Gov. John Kitzhaber, in a debate with Republican challenger Dennis Richardson, claimed that Oregon is "the most trade-dependent state in the nation." A spokesman said Kitzhaber has previously said that Oregon "is one of" the most trade-dependent states in the U.S. If he had said that, we would have reached a different ruling. As it is, we find Kitzhaber’s claim False. Thoughts on this ruling?

pomt-01771	The Obama administration's policies "have reduced minority dropout rate by 25 percent."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/29/joe-biden/joe-biden-says-obama-policies-have-cut-minority-dr/	During a recent address in Las Vegas to the NAACP, Vice President Joe Biden touted the Obama administration’s role in helping students who are members of racial and ethnic minority groups. Calling the right to vote central to so many other human needs, Biden asked, "How else, were it not the right of all those folks to vote, do you think we would have been able to expand Pell grants for 2.5 million more students? How else would we have put in place the educational policies that have reduced minority dropout rate by 25 percent?" We wondered whether minority dropout rates have fallen by one-quarter during President Barack Obama’s tenure and, if so, whether it’s fair for the administration to take credit in a significant way. Before we look at the numbers, we should explain that there is more than one way to measure dropout frequency. One of the most common is the "status dropout rate," which measures, at a specific point in time, what percent of people within a certain age range are dropouts. The other measurement is called the "event dropout rate." This measures what percentage of people in an age range dropped out during the prior year. The different methods can lead to different figures. In addition, we should note that the data is not entirely up to date. The Education Department has released data on the status dropout rate through 2012, and on the event dropout rate for two specific years, 2008 and 2011. We’ll use the most recent data, but it isn’t a perfect fit for studying the entire Obama era. Using the status dropout rate, Biden is right on the numbers. For African-Americans between the ages of 16 and 24, the status dropout rate declined from 9.9 percent in 2008 to 7.5 percent in 2012. That’s a 24 percent decrease -- very close to what Biden said. For Hispanics, the rate declined from 18.3 percent to 12.7 percent over the same period -- a decrease of 31 percent, which is well above what Biden claimed. The data is somewhat more mixed if you look at the event dropout rate for 15-to-24 year-olds. Between 2008 and 2011, the dropout rate for African-Americans fell from 6.1 percent to 3.8 percent, or a decrease of 38 percent. For Hispanics, however, the decrease was smaller than the 25 percent Biden cited -- the rate fell from 4.9 percent to 4.1 percent, or a decline of 16 percent. So on the numbers, Biden isn’t perfect, but he’s pretty close. What about whether the administration deserves credit for the decline? On an Education Department Web page, the administration cites a number of policies it credits for reducing the dropout rate. The list includes competitive funds such as the Race to the Top, Promise Neighborhoods, and Investing in Innovation programs; an initiative that give states more flexibility to target schools most needing improvement; and programs like Ladders of Opportunity and Promise Zones that provide federal assistance to "communities of concentrated poverty." The administration says it has committed $6.2 billion to School Improvement Grants focused on roughly 2,000 persistently low-achieving schools, "which produce a disproportionate number of the more than 500,000 students who drop out of high school each year." Education experts we contacted said such efforts may well have made a difference. But they added that there’s a long list of factors that likely played a role as well. "While the educational policies put in place by the Obama administration have played their role in addressing the dropout crisis, it would be unfair to attribute the recent decreases in minority dropout rates solely to them," said Jennifer DePaoli, education advisor at Civic Enterprises, a research group that studies education. Here’s a rundown of the other factors that likely influenced the decline in dropout rates, according to experts: Policies instituted by George W. Bush President George W. Bush spearheaded and signed the No Child Left Behind Act, and there’s evidence that it has had an impact on dropout rates. While the decline in dropout rates has accelerated under Obama, the decline actually began under Bush. Between 2000 and 2008, status dropout rates fell by 24 percent for African-Americans and by 34 percent for Hispanics -- significant decreases on their own, even before Obama took office. Changes in policy "can take a while to trickle down, and we might be seeing a delayed and ongoing effect of policies from several years earlier," said Christopher Swanson, vice president of Editorial Projects in Education, which publishes Education Week. "If you look at the overall trend, things have been moving in the right direction for a while." State policies matter, too -- not just federal policies Not only can states pass their own education laws, but they often have some discretion in shaping how federal education policies take effect within their borders. "If Biden is right that national policies are driving things, you wouldn’t get a lot of state-level differences in dropout trends," said David Bills, a professor at the University of Iowa College of Education. "But in fact there are differences." Indeed, a study by Civic Enterprises, America’s Promise Alliance, the Alliance for Excellent Education and the Everyone Graduates Center at John Hopkins University found quite a bit of variation. Twenty states recorded annual gains of at least one percentage point in graduation rates between 2006 and 2010, the report found, while nine states saw flat or declining graduation rates over the same period. In fact, one problem with trusting the statistics too much is that the state numbers may be subject to bureaucratic hijinks, said Julian Vasquez Heilig, a University of Texas professor of educational policy and planning. In Texas, for instance, there’s been skepticism about the validity of statistics showing large shifts in the number of students going from in-school to home-school status. Home-schooled students, as it happens, don’t count in dropout calculations. "Only politicians believe that the dropout rate has gone down," Heilig said. "Ask any educator in an urban schools and they will tell you otherwise. Essentially, we find ways to define away students." A poor economy can keep more kids in school One of the perverse impacts of a weak economy is that it may lead to lower dropout rates. During a strong economic period, slack labor markets may lure teens away from school through job offers and higher wages. But during weaker economic periods, someone who drops out of school would face few employment options. That might be enough to keep a lid on the dropout rate. "Kids are more likely to stay in school when there are no job opportunities," Bills said. "I think economics generally trumps policy." Broader demographic factors can drive dropout trends, too Richard Murnane, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, cites several trends beyond the Great Recession that may have helped lower the dropout rate over the last decade or so. One is a decline in the teenage birthrate, which means that fewer high-school girls are dropping out to take care of a newborn. Another is a decline in arrests of teenagers for violent crimes, reducing another reason for dropping out. And a third is an increase in the number of children attending preschool -- a predictor of future academic success, especially for low-income boys, Murnane said. "There’s no causal evidence that can tell you the relative importance of these factors in explaining the trends" in dropout rates, Murnane said. In all, then, these experts don’t doubt that there’s been some impact from Obama administration policies, but they add that there are many bigger forces that can claim a share of the credit for lowering dropout rates. "It would be nearly impossible to point to any specific federal policies put in place by the Obama administration -- or the Bush administration, for that matter -- that have been directly responsible for the decrease in dropout rates and the increase in graduation rates for minority students," DePaoli said. Our ruling Biden said Obama administration policies "have reduced minority dropout rate by 25 percent." He’s very close on the numbers, and the administration can take some credit for the decline. But a lot of other factors likely played a role, from Bush-era policies to state-level action to larger forces such as the weak economy, falling teen birth rates and rising preschool enrollment. On balance, we rate Biden’s claim Half True.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2014-07-29T12:20:06	2014-07-23	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-11331	There are "paid protesters" involved in the Stephon Clark demonstrations.	false	/california/statements/2018/apr/10/scott-jones/protesters-hire-sacramento-sheriff-provides-no-evi/	Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones claimed "paid protesters" fueled the conflict with law enforcement after a recent vigil and demonstration for Stephon Clark, a 22-year-old shot and killed by police. Responding to a call of a man breaking car windows, Sacramento police fired 20 times at Clark, who they said was advancing toward them with a gun in his grandparents’ backyard on March 18, 2018. Later, it was revealed, he was carrying a cellphone. Ever since, demonstrators have filled Sacramento’s streets, as well as city council meetings, calling for police reform. Jones made his statement about paid protesters during a news conference in early April. The sheriff showed video from March 31, 2018 of a deputy’s SUV striking a demonstrator who walked in front of the vehicle. A crowd of marchers had blocked two sheriff’s SUVs after a vigil for Clark in south Sacramento. Deputies had asked the crowd to step away before the collision took place. Jones described some of the people in the streets as "professional protesters and professional instigators." "We do know because of our intelligence, because of the same folks that we see at protests completely out of the area and because of our history with some of these folks that there are paid protesters," the sheriff added. "And paid people to instigate just as there are paid folks to monitor protests and video camera for their own purposes." When asked for evidence by a reporter at the conference, Jones said: "We do have evidence of it and we've seen it previously," though he was not specific. For this fact-check, we decided to zero in on Jones’ claim that some "paid protesters" took part in the Stephon Clark demonstrations, either on the evening of the vigil or before. Protest organizers have described the sheriff’s statement as baseless and inflammatory, saying the demonstrators are volunteers and not for-hire protesters. Stephon Clark, 22, was shot and killed by Sacramento police on March 18, 2018. Courtesy photo Response from sheriff’s department In a phone interview, Sgt. Shaun Hampton, a spokesman for the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department, declined to provide evidence supporting the sheriff’s statement. "I don’t think we’re going to disclose that at this time," Hampton said, adding that he did not foresee the department disclosing evidence in the future. He also declined to say why Jones made the claim without providing any supporting material. "It’s based on our information," he said. Jones appears to be the only top law enforcement official to make such a claim. A spokesman for the Sacramento Police Department told us he did "not have any specific information" about paid protesters. Asked about paid protesters on Capital Public Radio's Insight program, Sacramento Police Chief Daniel Hahn said he believes Jones was referring only to the March 31, 2018 demonstration outside city limits. "I don't know. We weren't there," Hahn said of any payments. A spokeswoman for the California Department of Highway Patrol, which has also provided law enforcement at the demonstrations, said in an email the "CHP does not have evidence of paid protesters." Hundreds gather at the Sacramento District Attorney’s office on April 4, 2018 demanding justice for Stephon Clark. Vanessa S. Nelson / Capital Public Radio Response from protest organizers Most of the Sacramento demonstrations after Clark’s death have been well organized and peaceful. There have been isolated cases of vandalism, including breaking car windows, the disruption of a city council meeting, a brief closure of a freeway and the closure of a basketball arena. Jamier Sale is an organizer with the ANSWER Coalition’s Sacramento chapter. It helped lead the March 31, 2018 vigil and protest. ANSWER stands for Act Now to Stop War and End Racism. The national organization helped organize the U.S. antiwar movement opposing the 2003 invasion of Iraq, according to its website. Sale challenged Jones to release evidence to support his claim. "We’re an all volunteer-based organization and we’re run all from donations," Sale told PolitiFact California. "And we print our signs and we put them on sticks with our own hands. Nobody pays us to do anything. We’re organized and we’re effective. And if we come off as professional, that’s because we take what we do very seriously." Claire White is an attorney representing Wanda Cleveland, the woman struck by the deputy’s SUV. She is also vice president of the National Lawyers Guild Foundation, a volunteer organization which monitors police activity at protests, including at the recent Sacramento events. "This allegation that these people are paid, or that they’re outside agitators, has no basis in reality," White told Capital Public Radio. "The longer that Sheriff Scott Jones tries to sell that snake oil to the public, the more it’s going to tarnish his own credibility." Tanya Faison is with the Sacramento chapter of Black Lives Matter, which has also organized recent protests. "We are not paid," Faison said. "We work for free. Some of us are mothers, students and interns. We do this on the side." She said Jones’ comments are "irresponsible" and could give his supporters in the community "permission to be more aggressive" with protesters. David Meyer is a sociology and political science professor at UC Irvine who wrote the book The Politics of Protest: Social Movements in America. He said politicians frequently make claims about paid protesters, without evidence, to marginalize people who represent opposing points of view. He said Democrats made those allegations about Tea Party activists in 2009 and Republicans made them about liberal activists who packed congressional town hall meetings in 2017. Meyer said it’s not realistic to think groups paid for protesters in the Stephon Clark case. He added that the sheriff’s "assertion without evidence is unconscionable." Other claims without proof This isn’t the first time PolitiFact has examined a provocative claim from a politician who didn’t support it with evidence. President Trump has repeatedly stated there was "serious voter fraud" in California in the 2016 election — without providing any proof. PolitiFact California investigated that allegation and rated it Pants On Fire. In February 2017, PolitiFact National probed a claim by GOP Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas that political activists were "being paid" to protest members of Congress. It concluded "It’s possible some protesters somewhere may be paid, but there’s zero evidence of a wide-ranging conspiracy to bring in paid activists to disrupt meetings." It rated that claim False. Our ruling Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones claimed "paid protesters" inflamed recent demonstrations over the death of Stephon Clark. Protest organizers say Sacramento’s streets have been filled with volunteers, not for-hire demonstrators. They’ve called the sheriff’s claim baseless. Jones appears to be the only top law enforcement official to make this assertion and has said he has evidence to back it up. His spokesman, however, declined to provide any information to support it and said it’s unlikely they ever will. When we evaluate statements at PolitiFact, the burden of proof is on the person making the claim. We’ll assess any information that might be released in the future. In the meantime, we rate Jones’ claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-01976	"The typical Wisconsin worker makes $5,000 less each year than our neighbors in Minnesota" under Gov. Scott Walker’s policies.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jun/18/mary-burke/minnesota-tops-wisconsin-average-wages-5000-year-m/	Democrats ripping jobs gains under Republican Gov. Scott Walker often point to the post-recession progress in Minnesota, where the jobs recovery has outpaced that of Wisconsin. Walker, meanwhile, prefers comparisons to Illinois and its budget problems and big tax hikes. In September 2013, we rated Half True a Minnesota lawmaker’s claim that the Gopher State is "kicking butt relative to Wisconsin" on employment, school test scores, workforce education and other rankings. But we haven’t, until now, tested claims of an income gap. Gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke proclaimed such a gap in June 6, 2014 remarks to delegates gathered in Lake Delton for the state Democratic Party’s annual convention. "As you know," Burke said, "our current governor has made quite a name for himself. His divisive brand of politics may have made national headlines, but those policies have hurt middle-class families right here in Wisconsin." She added: "But the people of Wisconsin, we know Scott Walker. He promised us 250,000 new jobs. But what did we get? We’re 9th out of 10 midwestern states in job growth -- ninth out of 10! And the typical Wisconsin worker makes $5,000 less each year than our neighbors in Minnesota." Let’s see if Burke’s statement about a Minnesota advantage in the Walker era holds up. What the numbers show Burke’s campaign cited one source for numbers on earnings. We looked at it and two others. All show Minnesota on top. -- The annual average wage of Minnesota workers was $47,370 as of May 2013 -- $5,060 higher than the $42,310 figure for Wisconsin, according to survey-based estimates published by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The 2013 data is the most recent available. -- Average earnings per job in 2012 were $53,928 in Minnesota, $4,931 more than Wisconsin’s $48,997, according to the most recent U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data. That figure takes in a larger group -- not only workers’ wages and salaries but "proprietor’s income" from self-employment. -- The same data, stripped down to exclude proprietor’s income to focus more on regular salaries and wages, shows a gap of $5,757 in Minnesota’s favor, according to research by Dale Knapp at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. So Burke’s figures are solid. More about the numbers In her convention speech, Burke argued in a general way that Walker’s policies are linked to the wage gap. Given all the factors that influence a state’s economy, experts agree the actions of a governor have a limited effect. Nevertheless, Burke’s claim misses the mark by pinning the gap solely on Walker. The Minnesota-Wisconsin wage gap dates to at least the 1960s, and gradually has grown despite ups and downs. When we asked Burke campaign spokesman Joe Zepecki about that, he argued that Walker's economic policies -- which Walker touts as turning the state around -- haven't improved it or closed that gap. As examples, he cited Walker’s refusal to accept the federal expansion of Medicaid and his opposition to a minimum wage increase. By any of our three measures, the gap did not narrow in Walker’s first two years. It grew significantly based on the average earnings per job data. It held steady if you use the other two methods. The average earnings data shows the Minnesota wage advantage averaged 7.4 percent during the second four-year term of Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, who preceded Walker. So far under Walker the average is 8.8 percent. The gap of 9.1 percent in 2012, Walker’s second year, is the highest since 2000, when Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson was in charge. It’s not that Wisconsin’s average wage has fallen during the Walker era. It’s up 5.5 percent in two years, right around the national average increase. But Minnesota has fared somewhat better, which creates the increase in the gap. In combing through the annual average wage data for the two states, there are some interesting disparities between specific jobs. Minnesota ran up part of its lead on these: Occupation Minnesota average wage Wisconsin average wage Registered nurse $71,160 $64,460 Management, all positions $107,130 $97,920 Dentist $193,100 $177,430 Police and sheriff patrol officer $58,220 $54,140 Social worker (child/family/school) $59,830 $49,720 School bus driver $32,500 $29,190 Computer systems analyst $81,560 $75,170 Lawyer $126,520 $105,080 Wisconsin holds the upper hand in other categories, including: Occupation Minnesota average wage Wisconsin average wage Farm, fishing, forestry $30,910 $31,260 Retail Salesperson $23,730 $24,420 Mortician, undertaker, funeral director $58,340 $65,720 Chiropractor $72,810 $90,170 Pediatrician $185,550 $200,480 According to a bankrate.com calcuator, the Minneapolis area’s cost of living is 8.5% higher than that of the Milwaukee metro area. Our rating Burke told delegates at the state Democratic convention that "the typical Wisconsin worker makes $5,000 less each year than our neighbors in Minnesota" under Walker’s policies. The gap is real and Burke hit the mark with her description of it. The gap has grown or held steady in Walker’s time depending on the measuring stick used. Burke didn’t say Walker created the gap, but the disparity is a longstanding one, and one that existed and grew under governors of both political stripes. We rate her claim Mostly True.

pomt-11588	"Apple has just announced it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America, and hire another 20,000 workers."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/31/donald-trump/donald-trump-inflates-apple-investment/	In his State of the Union address, President Donald Trump led off with the economy, and he drew particular attention to the recently passed tax law. "Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses," Trump said. "And it’s getting more every month, every week. Apple has just announced it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America, and hire another 20,000 workers." A number of readers asked us to take a closer look at his claim about Apple, so we did. Apple’s press release We can see where Trump got his number. Under the headline "Apple accelerates US investment and job creation," Apple announced on Jan. 17 a series of initiatives to bolster its position in the United States. "Combining new investments and Apple’s current pace of spending with domestic suppliers and manufacturers — an estimated $55 billion for 2018 — Apple’s direct contribution to the U.S. economy will be more than $350 billion over the next five years," the statement said. Notice that Apple did not say it plans to invest $350 billion. It described its "direct contribution to the U.S. economy." Charles Lee, accounting professor at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business, told us the distinction is huge. "Apple certainly did not just announce it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America," Lee said. "This is a statement about its importance to the U.S. economy, not a statement about its new investments due to the tax law change." So what did Apple’s press release actually say? It said its purchases from other companies will be large -- about $55 billion in 2018. Lee said if that number didn’t grow, Apple would spend about $275 billion over five years. But that’s "pre-planned," Lee said. It’s the cost of doing business and doesn’t represent new investment. If it isn’t an investment in expansion, such as building new facilities, buildings and data centers, that brings the investment total down to $75 billion. But even that figure is too high. Apple wrote the $75 billion includes expected "repatriation tax payments of approximately $38 billion." The new tax law offers a lower tax rate for companies that move profits off the books of their overseas subsidiaries and put them on their domestic balance sheets. Not only is paying Uncle Sam not an investment, Lee cautioned that it doesn’t even mean that Apple is doing anything with those overseas profits immediately. "It simply means they are pre-paying the taxes on that cash right now to take advantage of the lower rates," Lee said. "This ensures Apple will not need to pay any more taxes when, if ever, they decide to bring the cash back." After subtracting the taxes, Lee said "My best estimate of the change in Apple's U.S. investments attributable to the new laws is at most $37 billion." It could be a few billion less. In a section called "Growing Apple's U.S. operations," the company wrote that it "expects to invest over $30 billion in capital expenditures in the U.S. over the next five years and create over 20,000 new jobs through hiring at existing campuses and opening a new one." In addition, it will add $4 billion to an Advanced Manufacturing Fund, an Apple program that helps finance American and foreign companies to expand in America. That adds up to $34 billion over five years. Our ruling Trump said that Apple said it will invest $350 billion in America and hire another 20,000 workers. Trump got the new hires figure right, but Apple’s own announcement doesn’t back him up on the investment dollars. After deducting the costs of paying suppliers and paying taxes, an accounting professor estimated the investment at no more than $37 billion. And based on the press release, it could be $34 billion. That’s still a lot of money, but it’s less than 10 percent of what Trump said. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-00898	"There are at least three sectors of the border, one in particular, that are just completely insecure."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/05/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-least-three-sectors-border-are-complet/	Sen. Marco Rubio said he’s learned some lessons from his first failed foray into the immigration policy game. "What I’ve learned, is you can’t even have a conversation about that until people believe and know — not just believe, but it’s proven to them — that future illegal immigration will controlled," Rubio said. "That is the single biggest lesson of the last two years." A big piece of that, Rubio said, is border security, and he gave this stat: "There are at least three sectors of the border, one in particular, that are just completely insecure." The southwest border spans from San Diego to the southern tip of Texas, and it is broken into nine sectors. Are at least three of those sectors "completely insecure"? We decided to check. What is ‘secure’? Border patrol agents have many duties, of which stopping illegal migration is one. They also have to prevent drugs and weapons trafficking across the border, thwart potential terrorist plots, stop money laundering, among other tasks. As it is, there’s no set definition for what constitutes a "secure" border, experts told us. If you think one failure to apprehend a border crosser means a sector is insecure, then the whole border lacks security. That’s unreasonable. But where do you draw the line for what constitutes "secure." Additionally, we don’t know exactly what percentage of people successfully cross the border, nor how many successful drug running missions there are each year, etc. We can measure how many are caught in the act, but that’s only one part of the equation. So when Rubio says the border is "completely insecure," that’s not really grounded in any set metric. We asked Rubio’s office to explain what he meant by "completely insecure" and which three border sectors he was referring to. Spokeswoman Brooke Sammon did not respond to our multiple emails and calls. Measuring sector security A Government Accountability Office report from 2011 on border control measures broke down how much of each sector in 2010 was under "operational control." That means agents had the ability to apprehend violators upon or immediately after entry. Here’s what they found. Four sectors obviously stick out for their lack of operational control: Marfa (now called Big Bend), Del Rio, Laredo and Rio Grande Valley. All four achieved operational control for less than 40 percent of their respective sector. Again, this data is from 2010, so it’s unclear how those sectors of the border have fared since. At the time, operational control of the border had been increasing by 126 miles annually dating back to 2005 and more resources have been put toward the border since. Additionally, these are based on qualitative assessments. Also, the Department of Homeland Security scrapped them because they don’t provide much useful information for determining the effectiveness of border security in a particular sector. It hasn’t replaced it with anything more useful yet, said Theresa Brown, director of immigration policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center. The Bipartisan Policy Center tracks an effectiveness rate for each sector based on the number of apprehensions and turnbacks versus "got aways," meaning border patrol agents found evidence (security footage, tracks, etc.) that someone made it through. Here are the center’s most recent calculations for Fiscal Year 2013. Sector Apprehensions Turnbacks Got aways Effectiveness Big Bend 3,493 160 1,757 67.52 percent Del Rio 20,904 4,287 5,157 83.01 percent El Centro 15,725 3,688 2,779 87.48 percent El Paso 10,214 12,054 1,599 93.30 percent Laredo 45,971 16,032 15,603 79.89 percent Rio Grande 128,426 69,815 102,763 65.88 percent San Diego 26,428 7,518 3,861 89.79 percent Tucson 110,264 40,946 37,098 80.30 percent Yuma 5,734 1,993 434 94.64 percent By this rating, there are two sectors that are well below the rest in effectiveness rating: Big Bend and Rio Grande. It’s worth pointing out that Big Bend, in west Texas, sees a smaller level of activity than most other sectors and experts generally don’t consider it a problem zone. "You wouldn’t invest a lot of resources into a sector like Big Bend with very little traffic," said Christopher Wilson, a senior associate at the Wilson Center’s Mexico Institute. The Rio Grande Experts we spoke with easily identified the one border sector Rubio singled out when he said "one in particular" faced security issues: the Rio Grande sector. The number of apprehensions at the Rio Grande sector doubled to 256,000 in 2014 as a wave of unaccompanied minors and migrants from Central America attempted to enter the United States through the southernmost part of Texas. This has posed new challenges for the sector, which also saw a 7 percentage point drop in its effectiveness rate from 2012 to 2013. "I’m not sure what the senator means when he says ‘completely insecure,’ but it is true that there has been a big surge in border crossers at that point over the last few years," said Alex Nowrasteh, immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. As for the other two sectors that are "completely insecure," experts studying immigration at four different think tanks of varying political stripe couldn’t guess which two Rubio was referring to. The border sector with the most activity other than the Rio Grande is Tucson, which for a long time was the preferred route for Mexican immigration. However, apprehensions are down there from over 600,000 in 2000 to less than 90,000 in 2014. Rubio’s statement in general misses the broader trends across most of the border: Illegal migration through the border is down considerably from the record highs of the previous decade. In 2007, there were 1.6 million apprehensions, turn backs or gotaways at the border, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. That dropped to 741,881 in 2013. That gels with other data that shows the overall population of native Mexicans living in the United States is leveling, Wilson said. Additionally, eight sectors, including the troubled Rio Grande, had higher effectiveness ratings in 2013 than they did in 2006. "The number of people trying to come across the southwest border is substantially lower than it was in the late 1990s and early 2000s," Brown said. "It's starting to increase again, but the absolute levels are way, way down, the lowest since the 1970s." Our ruling Rubio said, "There are at least three sectors of the border, one in particular, that are just completely insecure." We don’t know how Rubio came up with three sectors, and neither did experts we spoke with. There certainly is one sector of late with a troubling amount of activity, the Rio Grande in south Texas, that also is less effective at apprehending border crossers than other sectors. However, the number of people attempting to cross the border is down considerably everywhere else, and the effectiveness rating is up in eight of nine sectors since 2006, including the areas with the most significant activity. We rate Rubio’s statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2e370df5-2b7f-4bc1-86fe-266ef5ab8886	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2015-03-05T10:50:55	2015-02-27	['None']
pomt-15209	Says Bernie Sanders chose "to spend his honeymoon in the Soviet Union in 1988."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/12/george-will/george-will-reminds-readers-about-bernie-sanders-u/	For most couples, the ideal honeymoon getaway might entail a week of unwinding at a beach resort or a stay in a secluded mountainside cabin. Not Bernie Sanders. He chose a colder route. Sanders and his wife, Jane Sanders, spent their first days as newlyweds in the Soviet Union, claims George Will in a recent Washington Post column. Will’s Aug. 7 column focused mostly on the legacy of Robert Conquest, who died Aug. 3 at age 98, and whose writings on Soviet prisons documented the atrocities of the Stalin regime. A reader asked us to look into the accuracy of the final paragraph of Will’s column, which invoked Sanders’ "honeymoon." It reads: "Conquest lived to see a current U.S. presidential candidate, a senator, who had chosen, surely as an ideological gesture, to spend his honeymoon in the Soviet Union in 1988. Gulags still functioned, probably including some of the ‘cold Auschwitzes’ in Siberia, described in Conquest’s ‘Kolyma.’ The honeymooner did not mind that in 1988 political prisoners were — as may still be the case — being tortured in psychiatric ‘hospitals.’ Thanks to the unblinking honesty of people like Conquest, the Soviet Union now is such a receding memory that Bernie Sanders’s moral obtuseness — the obverse of Conquest’s character — is considered an amusing eccentricity." We wanted to see if Sanders actually honeymooned on the turf of the United States’ former adversary during the final years of the Cold War. Sister cities The trip took place while Sanders was mayor of Burlington, Vt., from 1981 to 1989. Toward the end of his mayoral tenure, the small city on Lake Champlain launched a sister-city program with Yaroslavl, located 160 miles northeast of Moscow. The program, which is still operating today, has facilitated exchanges between the two cities involving "mayors, business people, firefighters, jazz musicians, youth orchestras, mural painters, high school students, medical students, nurses, librarians and the (Yaroslavl) ice-hockey team," according to its website. Along with sister-city relationships with Bethlehem in the West Bank and Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua, the Yaroslavl program was part of Sanders’ unorthodox attempt to take on international issues from a small city in New England. Sanders also actively pursued his agenda outside of the country, writing letters to world leaders and even traveling to Cuba to meet with the mayor of Havana. "Burlington had a foreign policy," he wrote in his 1997 book Outsider in the House, "because, as progressives, we understood that we all live in one world." The bond between Burlington and Yaroslavl solidified when Sanders and his wife, as members of a 12-person delegation from Burlington, paid their Soviet counterparts a visit in 1988. The timing of the trip was unusual. Bernie and Jane were married May 28, 1988. The delegation left Burlington the next day. "Trust me," Sanders writes in the book. "It was a very strange honeymoon." When reached for comment, Sanders’ campaign said that the dates for the trip had already been set, and the couple "set their wedding date to coincide with that trip because they didn't want to take more time off." In a 2007 interview, Jane Sanders also recalled the peculiar timing: "The day after we got married, we marched in a Memorial Day parade, and then we took off in a plane to start the sister city project with Yaroslavl with 10 other people on my honeymoon." Bernie Sanders also refers to the trip sarcastically as "quiet and romantic" in his book. The "honeymoon" was dotted with meetings, interviews and diplomatic functions. A June 2015 profile in The Guardian described the former mayor’s meeting with Yaroslavl city officials: "After receiving a rundown of central planning, Soviet-style, from Yaroslavl’s mayor, Alexander Riabkov, Sanders notes how the quality of both housing and health care in America appeared to be ‘significantly better’ than in the communist state. ‘However,’ he added, ‘the cost of both services is much, much, higher in the United States.’ " An education in central planning probably wasn’t the only item on Sanders’ itinerary. Yaroslavl is home to historic churches and buildings, and the Sanderses would have been in for some good sightseeing, said Ariel Cohen, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. Will made it sound as if Sanders was visiting to condone Soviet torture practices, but the Burlington trip was more of a dialogue-building exchange program. The Vermont weekly newspaper Seven Days reported in 2009 that the sister-city relationship "helped local residents who sought to ease tensions between the United States and Soviet Union by initiating citizen-to-citizen exchanges with a Russian city." Also, the Soviet Union was barely intact at the time of the trip. Negotiations had opened up between President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev a few years earlier. "It was at the beginning of perestroika," said Michael Briggs, a spokesman for the Sanders campaign, referring to the restructuring policy Gorbachev instituted in the mid 1980s. Gulags still existed and political prisoners were still held in 1988, said Ariel Cohen, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. But a watershed moment came when Gorbachev allowed physicist Andrei Sakharov to return from internal exile two years earlier. "The power of the Communist Party was being questioned and the confrontation with the West was winding down through negotiations," Cohen said. In 1987, Reagan and Gorbachev signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, and in 1988, Reagan himself spoke in Moscow’s Red Square. One year later brought the fall of the Berlin Wall. Three years later, the Soviet Union collapsed. Participation in the Burlington-Yaroslavl program has waned over the years, though it was viewed as a "glamorous endeavor" by many in Burlington at the time, program leader Howard Seaver said in 2009. Will could not be reached for comment through his researcher. Our ruling Will wrote that Sanders chose "to spend his honeymoon in the Soviet Union in 1988." Sanders and his wife did travel to Yaroslavl, a city in the Soviet Union, after their wedding in 1988. In the sense that the trip came after the couple were married, the trip was a honeymoon. The two have also referred to the trip that way, albeit sarcastically at times. But it was an unusual honeymoon, to say the least. The trip’s primary purpose was diplomacy, not leisure, and included about 10 extra guests. Will’s claim is accurate but is missing context about the trip’s underlying purpose. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	George Will	None	None	None	2015-08-12T10:56:28	2015-08-07	['Soviet_Union', 'Bernie_Sanders']
pomt-09979	In the 1970s, "the swine flu broke out . . . under another Democrat, President Jimmy Carter."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/apr/30/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-wrong-70s-swine-flu-broke-our-/	Michele Bachmann, a Republican member of Congress from Minnesota, is known for her controversial remarks. During the fall of 2008, she nearly lost her re-election campaign because she said Barack Obama "may have anti-American views." In a 2009 radio interview, she said incorrectly that six Muslim clerics who were removed from a US Airways flight in 2006 were attending a "victory celebration" for Keith Ellison, a Muslim who was elected to Congress. So we weren't exactly surprised when we heard her suggest a link between Democratic presidents and the swine flu. Here's her comment, from an interview with Pajamas Media: "I find it interesting that it was back in the 1970s that the swine flu broke out then under another Democrat president, Jimmy Carter. And I'm not blaming this on President Obama, I just think it's an interesting coincidence." Well, at least she's right about the decade. Yes, the last big swine flu scare occurred in the 1970s. But other than that, her statement is utterly false. The scare began in February 1976 when recruits at Fort Dix, N.J., came down with flu symptoms, and one died. This led to fears of a pandemic. The president in 1976 was Gerald Ford — a Republican. Ford, following the advice of public health officials, called for a nationwide vaccination program. In just 10 days, 40 million Americans were vaccinated. But three senior citizens died shortly after receiving their swine flu shots. A public outcry blamed the deaths on the immunizations even though there was no evidence. As a recent article in Salon notes, "The government had long feared mass panic about swine flu — now they feared mass panic about the swine flu vaccinations." Political analyst Craig Crawford wrote this week that "Gerald Ford's decision to inoculate every person in the country (including himself) resulted in a political debacle that contributed to a reputation for incompetence that scuttled his 1976 election bid." Swine flu also surfaced briefly in 1988, killing a woman in Wisconsin who had visited a swine exhibit at a county fair. The president at the time was Ronald Reagan — a Republican. So Bachmann is wrong about a Democrat being in charge during the 1976 outbreak and she fails to note the swine flu death in 1988. Hmmm. Two swine flu incidents during Republican administrations. By Bachmann's logic, we should find that "interesting." But we don't. It's ridiculous for her to suggest a partisan link with a deadly disease. That's not just a mistake, that's absurdly false. So we'll get out the lighter (after we wash our hands!) and set the Truth-O-Meter ablaze. This one's a Pants on Fire.

pomt-14828	"@Jorge_Elorza still think your plan is safe? Rescue Captain Kenyon just worked 96 hours straight. 96 hours."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2015/nov/22/paul-doughty/union-mayor-rescue-captain-worked-96-hours-straigh/	In early November, a Providence fire captain, Zachariah Kenyon, clocked 96 hours in a row — the equivalent of two 48-hour work weeks. The 45-year-old’s marathon tour of duty follows much argument over the restructuring of the firefighters’ shift schedule, ordered in August by Mayor Jorge O. Elorza. Instead of working 42 hours per week in four shifts firefighters are now working in three shifts of 48 hours every six days, or an average of 56 hours per week. One vocal critic of the change, Paul A. Doughty, president of the firefighters’ union, went on Twitter to address the mayor: "...still think your plan is safe? Rescue Captain Kenyon just worked 96 hours straight. 96 hours. Your plan is a disaster!!!" So a firefighter worked 96 hours straight? We wondered if that really happened. And if so, how? We reached out to Public Safety Commissioner Steven M. Pare, Doughty and Kenyon, who also has a leadership position in the union, serving on its board and representing about 80 fire employees in special services divisions. Of course, we were interested in Kenyon’s story, but initially we just wanted to see the records. Kenyon gave us a personnel record that shows he reported to duty on the morning of Friday, Nov. 6, around 8 a.m. and he remained on duty for a 96-hour period that ended Tuesday, Nov. 10, around 8 a.m. The personnel record also shows that Kenyon had originally been scheduled to work two 10-hour shifts, one on Friday and another on Saturday followed by two 14-hour overnight shifts on Sunday into Monday and Monday into Tuesday. This adds up to 48 hours on duty over 5 days. Kenyon ended up on duty for each of the four scheduled shifts plus all hours in between, according to the record. The captain accepted one overtime shift and he was ordered to stand duty for the other three shifts. This is how he explained how he came to be on duty for 96 hours and Pare confirmed it. Ninety-six hours seems like a very long time for someone with public safety responsibilities to be on the clock. For Doughty and other firefighters, "working" and being on duty are the same thing. However, Providence firefighters, unlike police officers, can often climb into bed between emergencies during their shifts. So Kenyon was not on his feet like a construction worker or an emergency room nurse for 96 straight hours. It’s also clear that he got paid for 96 hours of work. Without knowing how much Kenyon slept, it seemed reasonable for Doughty to ask the mayor if this was safe. Pare asserts that the captain had ample opportunity to get the rest necessary to perform effectively in emergency situations and Kenyon could have asked to go home if he felt he hadn’t had enough sleep to operate safely. Kenyon, who doesn’t remember how much sleep he had during the 96 hours, says he was able to operate safely. "I feel I’m pretty capable," he says. Doughty disagrees, suggesting that sleep deprivation erodes a person’s ability to make good judgments about his or her capabilities. It’s against department policy for firefighters to sleep past 7 a.m., he says, and the noise at fire headquarters, with alarms sounding, is another issue. "It’s not good sleep," Doughty says. "It’s not rehabilitative sleep." We looked at public safety records, including dispatch logs, and found that Kenyon and those who also worked on Rescue 4 handled 67 emergency calls over the course of 96 hours. The crew transported 43 patients to hospitals and 15 calls were cancelled en route, according to the records we reviewed, which are not clear on what happened with the other nine calls. Kenyon, who says he doesn’t need as much sleep as others, recalls sleeping the last seven hours of his 96-hours on duty, but he says he doesn’t remember when he slept during the first 89 hours. Records that Pare provided to PolitiFact indicate there were several other periods within that 89-hour span when Kenyon was not busy with calls and had some opportunity for sleep. The records show three periods of about four hours during the morning hours of Saturday, Nov. 7, Sunday Nov. 8, and Monday Nov. 9. Our ruling No one disputes that Kenyon was on duty for 96 straight hours, Kenyon had some opportunity for sleep and it’s likely he did. But he doesn’t remember when that was, or for how long. He only recalls sleeping during the last 7 of the 96 hours The question that Doughty Tweeted: "@Jorge_Elorza still think your plan is safe?" was fair to ask, even if the public was not at risk as both Pare and the captain assert. (Further, Pare disputes Doughty’s charge that the plan is a "disaster!!!") But without clarification, Doughty’s suggestion that Kenyon "worked 96 hours straight" could leave the impression that Kenyon never slept. He did sleep. To be more accurate, Doughty could have said that Kenyon had been "on duty" for 96 hours. The job, by its nature, involves a mixture of sleep and work. For this reason, we rate Doughty’s claim Mostly True.	None	Paul Doughty	None	None	None	2015-11-22T00:00:00	2015-11-10	['None']
pomt-09497	"As bank president, Alex Sink eliminated thousands of Florida jobs while taking over $8 million in salary and bonuses."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/feb/24/republican-governors-association/republican-governors-association-blasts-sinks-reco/	On Feb. 23, 2010, the Republican Governors Association -- the gubernatorial campaign arm of the national GOP -- fired a shot at Alex Sink, the Democratic candidate for governor of Florida. The RGA, which is backing Republican Bill McCollum, took aim at Sink's career as a top executive at Bank of America and its predecessor in Florida, NationsBank. Here's the entire text of the 15-second advertisement, to be aired on broadcast and cable television outlets: "As bank president, Alex Sink eliminated thousands of Florida jobs while taking over $8 million in salary and bonuses. Alex Sink. Not one of us. One of them." In a fundraising e-mail sent several hours after the ad was launched, the Sink campaign attacked it as "full of dodges and distortions" and said it "misleads Floridians about Alex Sink's record as a business leader." We see three questions to probe here. One is whether her banks eliminated "thousands of Florida jobs" on Sink's watch. The second is whether the ad correctly describes Sink's compensation. And the third is whether it's fair to lay the blame for the job losses on Sink. We'll take these questions individually. Job losses We were unable to track down any official NationsBank documents addressing the issue of job losses from the Charlotte, N.C.-based bank's August 1997 acquisition of Jacksonville-based Barnett Bank. But news coverage at the time is consistent in reporting that the company planned to eliminate 6,000 jobs as a result of the merger. A Jan. 1, 1998, Miami Herald article quotes Rusty Rainey, who led the NationsBank-Barnett transition, saying that the merger would cut more than 6,000 jobs. Before the merger, the Herald reported, Barnett employed about 22,000 people and NationsBank had between 8,500 and 9,000 employees in Florida. It's worth noting that the 6,000 figure involves a bit of uncertainty. It's a prediction, rather than an after-the-fact accounting, so the final number may have been higher or lower. (In other reports, the Herald noted that new jobs might be created in back-office processing facilities in Jacksonville and with the expected addition of 60 to 80 supermarket branches.) In addition, Rainey said in the Herald article that the 6,000 target would be met largely by attrition rather than layoffs -- not an implausible goal, given the high rates of employee turnover in the banking industry and the relatively low unemployment levels at the time. Also, the subsequent merger of NationsBank with Bank of America in 1998 created an expected 8,000 job cuts. But that was a national number; the number of jobs lost in Florida specifically was not reported. Ultimately, none of these caveats matter much because the RGA ad was carefully worded. It speaks of "thousands of Florida jobs," rather than citing a specific number of job losses, and it refrains from describing the eliminated jobs as "layoffs." So we find this description accurate. Compensation Here too, we were unable to obtain original tax forms from the Sink campaign, but their contents were widely and consistently reported in 2002, when the gubernatorial campaign of Sink's husband, Democrat Bill McBride, released them to the public. The McBride campaign released Sink's tax returns for 2000 and 2001, which had been filed independently of her husband. Earlier, the campaign had released the couple's jointly filed return from 1999. When her income from these three years is combined, Sink earned in excess of $8 million. According to various news reports at the time, which were based directly on the tax returns released to the media, Sink earned $2.6 million in 1999, $3.4 million in 2000 and $2.8 million in 2001. (She took early retirement in a management shakeup in 2000.) That equals $8.8 million over three years. While that amount squares with the dollar figure cited in the ad, it's worth noting two caveats. One is that this income was earned between two and four years after the merger was announced. However, Sink held the same position at the time -- president of Florida operations for the bank -- and was presiding over the merged entity. So that doesn't strike us as being a major flaw. The other caveat concerns the ad's use of the term "salary and bonuses." In 2002, the Associated Press reported that Sink's 2000 income included "stock-options and lump-sum pension payments" and that her 2001 income included "stock options, deferred compensation and pension" payments. None of the coverage mentions "bonus" payments, and the campaign was not able to clarify whether she received any bonuses or not for those years. The RGA stands behind its characterization. "To most normal people, any compensation that is over and above your typical salary would be called a bonus," said spokesman Tim Murtaugh. "Very often, these bonuses take the form of some combination of stocks and other compensation." But we think the distinction is worth mentioning because in today's post-Wall Street crash environment, saying that a financial-services employee received a lucrative "bonus" at the same time the company was cutting jobs is a pretty loaded accusation. Absent any hard evidence that she received what experts would consider a "bonus," we'll downgrade the accuracy of this part of the ad slightly. Who's to blame? So our analysis suggests that the core facts in the ad are pretty accurate. But what about the larger context? Two banking experts noted that Sink did nothing unusual compared to other bank executives during that period of aggressive mergers. Stanley D. Smith, a finance professor at the University of Central Florida, said that the elimination of those jobs in the merger "would have and should have occurred no matter who the Florida CEO was. That merger was what is called an intramarket merger, where the two banks’ branches and operations overlapped. The premium that NationsBank paid was based on the savings that would occur from the elimination of overlapping branches and operations. Any competent banker would have done the same thing, and those unfortunate job losses are just a normal part of that type of merger." James McNulty, a finance professor at Florida Atlantic University, agreed. "Bank mergers very often involve job losses," he said. "The major reason that banks merge is to improve efficiency, and that involves eliminating positions that are redundant in the combined organization. In many cases jobs are reduced by attrition rather than by firing people -- those who leave are not replaced, and good people that the bank wants to retain are moved to new positions. This happens in most large bank mergers. Blaming it on Alex Sink is preposterous." There's one other issue worth considering: Was Sink as personally responsible for slashing jobs as the ad claims? Last May, Sink told reporters in the St. Petersburg Times-Miami Herald Tallahassee bureau that the decision to merge with Barnett was made by corporate executives at NationsBank headquarters in Charlotte, N.C. "I got a call one day just like the people at Barnett did that said an agreement has been reached," she said. Murtaugh of the RGA responds that "Sink was the president of the bank. Of course she was responsible for decisions made. If she says she wasn’t responsible and was only following orders, what does that say about her ability to tout her business experience? She can’t claim that she wasn’t in charge of decisionmaking and then also claim that she has business decisionmaking experience." On that point, we agree. Even if she were not the architect of the deal, she helped implement the merger over the next few years, and received a generous compensation package at the same time. With the exception of the term "bonus," which we think is a bit of a stretch, the RGA ad strikes us as generally accurate. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-11503	"So many of these people that commit the mass murders end up being Democrats."	pants on fire!	/new-york/statements/2018/feb/23/claudia-tenney/do-many-mass-shooters-end-being-democrats-rep-tenn/	An upstate New York member of Congress made national headlines when she suggested many mass shooters were Democrats. Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-Utica, was speaking with a radio host from Albany, N.Y., about how to prevent future mass shootings when she made the claim. "It's interesting that so many of these people that commit the mass murders end up being Democrats, but the media doesn't talk about that either," Tenney said on Feb. 21, 2018. The host of the radio show did not ask Tenney to back up her claim, but several reporters on Twitter did. Her office sent out a statement from Tenney that evening: "I am fed up with the media and liberals attempting to politicize tragedies and demonize law-abiding gun owners and conservative Americans every time there is a horrible tragedy," Tenney said in the statement. "While we know the perpetrators of these atrocities have a wide variety of political views, my comments are in response to a question about the failure to prosecute illegal gun crime. I will continue to stand up for law-abiding citizens who are smeared by anti-gun liberal elitists." Tenney did not answer questions about her claim at a press event the next day. Her office has not provided any support for the claim. (A lawmaker in North Carolina made a similar claim this week as well. Read more about that here.) We wondered if there was any truth to Tenney’s claim. Do many mass shooters turn out to be Democrats? Mass shooters since Columbine There is no universal definition for mass shootings. We looked at 19 shootings that have received significant national media coverage since the Columbine High School shooting in 1999. More than eight people were killed in each of the shootings. We found very few cases in which the political affiliation of the shooter could be verified. Omar Mateen, the shooter who killed 49 people at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in 2016, was registered as a Democrat in 2006. He voted in the Florida primary in 2016, according to reporting from Politico. A dating profile for Chris Harper Mercer, who killed nine people at a community college in Oregon in 2015, said he was a Republican, according to reporting from CBS News. There was no evidence of his political affiliation beyond the profile. A friend of Aaron Alexis, who killed 12 people at the Washington Navy Yard in 2013, said in a CNN interview that the shooter was "more of a liberal type." There were no other reports of his political affiliation. Politicians were the victims of a couple of recent shooting rampages that weren’t on our list of 19 mass shootings. In 2017, 66-year-old James Thomas Hodgkinson shot and injured six people at a congressional baseball game in Virginia — nearly killing House Majority Whip Steve Scalise. Hodgkinson volunteered for the presidential campaign of Democrat Bernie Sanders and apparently targeted the Republican team. In 2011, 22-year-old Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in Tucson at an event hosted by Rep. Gabby Giffords, an Arizona Democrat. Loughner killed six and injured 13 others, including Giffords. Authorities reported that he was obsessed with Giffords. Inaccurate reporting There was speculation about the political leanings of some of the other shooters. ABC News falsely reported that James Holmes, who killed 12 people in Colorado in 2012, was a member of the conservative tea party. ABC apologized for the error. Breitbart News reported that Holmes may have been a registered Democrat, but also walked back that claim. Holmes’ political affiliation was never verified. Fake news websites claimed Devin Patrick Kelley, who killed 26 people in a Texas church last year, was linked to anti-fascist groups. PolitiFact debunked that claim. Websites made the same claim about Las Vegas shooter Stephen Craig Paddock. We debunked that, too. Paddock wasn’t registered to vote and his family said he didn’t have strong political views, according to a report from Fox News. There were also claims that Adam Lanza, who killed 20 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, was a Democrat. He was not registered to vote, according to the Washington Post. Most recently, our friends at Snopes debunked the claim that Nikolas Cruz, who allegedly killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, was a Democrat. A search of Florida’s voter database yielded no results for Cruz’s party affiliation. There was no reporting on the political leanings of the other 11 shooters. Is it relevant? Mass shooters are rarely motivated by a political agenda, experts told us. Mass shootings are often perpetrated by young men who are socially isolated or have a mental illness, experience a trauma or conflict that sends them reeling emotionally, and have easy access to guns, said Alan Lipman, professor at George Washington University Medical Center and founder of the Center for the Study of Violence. "Their motives are almost always, without exception, nonpolitical. And they don’t describe themselves as having a particular political motivation," Lipman said. Some — like Dylann Roof, who killed nine people at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015 — might channel their rage at a specific group of people, said James Alan Fox, criminologist at Northeastern University and author of "Extreme Killing: Understanding Serial and Mass Murder." But that doesn’t mean they’re acting on a Republican or Democratic mission, he said. "Very few are motivated by any sort of political agenda in terms in parties. They might be anti-gay or anti-black or anti-white. You could argue those are political, I guess," he said. Even then, those beliefs are often born out of personal vendettas — not political propaganda, said Katherine Ramsland, professor of psychology at DeSales University. "Look at Stephen Paddock. We don't know his motive," Ramsland said of the Las Vegas shooter. "Devin Kelly — his political affiliation is secondary to his family disputes and need for payback. I just think it's overly simplistic to align a mass shooter's influence with a political ideology unless it's clear from the shooter that this was his (or her) driving issue." Other experts reacted similarly to the assertion that shooters tend to have common political beliefs. "Most of the school shooters are children who wouldn’t know a conservative from a communist," said Jack Levin, Northeastern professor and co-director of the Brudnick Center on Violence and Conflict. "The idea of associating politics with these mass murders is absurd. It has absolutely nothing to do with it." Lipman agreed: "There is absolutely no evidence to show that mass killings are motivated by political ideologies of any type. All of the mass killings we’ve seen have been motivated by a lethal combination of a small subgroup of mental illnesses, and easy accessibility to weapons of mass killing during the peak symptomatology of those illnesses." Our ruling Tenney said, "Many of these people that commit the mass murders end up being Democrats." There’s no proof to support that claim. The political affiliation of most of the mass shooters we looked at was either unreported or never verified. Experts said these events are rarely motivated by politics to begin with.

pomt-00908	Education funding of $7,176 per student is a "historic level."	half-true	/florida/statements/2015/mar/03/rick-scott/scott-calls-proposed-pupil-spending-historic/	Gov. Rick Scott used his annual opening address to the 2015 Legislature to talk about some of his favorite subjects -- taxes, business and his newfound penchant for spending more on education. SEE RICK SCOTT'S STATE OF THE STATE SPEECH ANNOTATED. "If we are going to out-compete the world, we must invest in K-12 education," he said. "This year, we are recommending an increase in K-12 funding to $50 above the historic level to $7,176 per student." That’s a change from Scott’s first year in office, when he recommended the Legislature slash $3.3 billion out of the education budget as Florida’s budget floundered during the recession. (They eventually cut $1.3 billion.) He has since reversed course, recommending additional funding each year as tax revenues and the state's economy rebounded. Let’s check the numbers to see if Scott’s per-pupil spending really is a historic high. Accounting for education K-12 education gets most of its money through the Florida Education Finance Program, a combination of state and local funding. School districts contribute property tax dollars, called the "required local effort," at a rate set by the state. Florida received federal stimulus dollars a couple of recent years, too. Total education spending became a flashpoint during the 2014 campaign when challenger and former Gov. Charlie Crist attacked Scott’s education spending. Scott responded by saying he now oversaw the highest education budget in state spending. But that was only true in total dollars, not per-pupil spending. After Crist said he held the record for spending per student, which many education advocates have said is a better method for measuring, Scott said he would raise the 2015-16 number to $50 higher than Crist’s record. That led to this year’s budget recommendation, which asks the Legislature for a $19.75 billion K-12 budget, working out to $7,176 per student. To keep track of it, let’s look at this table: Fiscal year K-12 budget (total) Per pupil spending 2007-08 (Crist) $18.7 billion $7,126 2008-09 (Crist) $17.9 billion $6,846 2009-10 (Crist)* $18 billion $6,846 2010-11 (Crist)* $18.2 billion $6,897 2011-12 (Scott) $16.6 billion $6,217 2012-13 (Scott) $17.2 billion $6,376 2013-14 (Scott) $18.3 billion $6,769 2014-15 (Scott) $18.9 billion $6,915 2015-16 (Scott -- recommended) $19.75 billion $7,176 The two years marked with an asterisk were years when Florida raked in about $900 million each in federal stimulus money to keep the budget afloat. Also note that for 2015-16, Scott’s proposal is a recommendation only; the Legislature ultimately will decide school funding levels. We should note some other caveats about Scott’s increased spending: First of all, remember that Florida schools have more students now than they did when Crist was in office. A current student total won’t be available until enrollments for next year are finished and added up, but in 2014-15 there were somewhere around 100,000 more students than in 2007. Overall spending would have to go up just to keep pace. Secondly, even though proposed spending could be increased $50, that hardly keeps up with the inflation realized in the eight-year span since Crist was in office. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index inflation calculator (an imperfect measure, to be sure, but a good benchmark), Scott would have to increase spending by an additional $850 or so to even match what per-pupil spending was in 2007. When we account for inflation, 2007’s $7,126 per-student funding comes out to $8,032 today. Our ruling Scott said his recommendation of education funding of $7,176 per student is a "historic level." That’s accurate only if you don’t account for inflation, which has ticked up each year since the previous per-student spending high in 2007-08. The claim is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.

The rating of Ohio's investment fund has NOT improved."	false	/ohio/statements/2012/sep/26/sherrod-brown/sherrod-brown-campaign-ad-targets-josh-mandel-trut/	Truthfulness has become a persistent issue in the U.S. Senate campaign between Sherrod Brown, the Democratic incumbent, and Josh Mandel, Ohio's Republican treasurer. The Brown campaign raised the issue explicitly this month in a 30-second TV ad titled "Pants on Fire." The ad accuses Mandel of being "the candidate of the big lie," and displays a newspaper column as the source for the line. "Now Josh is lying about his own record," the ad says. "The rating of Ohio's investment fund has NOT improved." The capital letters for emphasis are in the on-screen text of the words. The claim sounded familiar to PolitiFact Ohio, and with reason. When we asked the Brown campaign for supporting sources, they cited a fact-check by us and another by our friends at FactCheck.org. When we looked further, we found a third related fact-check by PolitiFact Ohio. The first item, from October 2011, reviewed the claim in a Mandel campaign email about the STAR (State Treasury Asset Reserve) Ohio fund, an investment pool with assets of more than $4.1 billion through which the state treasurer invests money for local governments. The campaign email said the STAR Ohio fund "just received the highest possible credit rating one of these funds can receive." The source for the claim was the credit rating agency Standard & Poor's, which sent the state a letter in August 2011 affirming a AAAm rating for the STAR Ohio fund. While that is the highest possible rating, STAR Ohio has received a AAAm rating since 1995, the first year S&P rated the fund. Public finance experts told us the treasurer deserved credit for maintaining the bond rating but did not "achieve" it. We found then that a reader could reasonably assume from his email that the rating had gone up. Because the rating already had been in place for 16 years and did not improve under Mandel, we said his email overstated the case. We rated the statement Half True. FactCheck.org, in May 2012, looked at a Mandel ad that said he "earned the highest possible credit ratings as state treasurer." That statement "could give viewers the impression that Mandel improved the state’s credit ratings, but that is not the case," FactCheck.org concluded. "Under Mandel, the state’s STAR Ohio investment fund has maintained its 'AAA' rating from Standard & Poor’s. But even the state treasurer’s office acknowledges that the fund has had that same rating since 1995." We also looked at that same ad statement last May, and found it more carefully worded than the claim in the email we examined earlier. Unlike the email, the statement did not imply that the credit rating had "just" improved. Because the statement was accurate but needed for clarification the additional information that the rating had been AAAm for 16 years, we rated it Mostly True. That brings us back to the Brown campaign’s TV ad. First, it is important to know that the fund already had achieved the highest possible rating. There was not room for improvement in the rating, as could be reasonably inferred from the TV ad. More importantly, though, the ad targets Mandel’s character, questioning his truthfulness, and makes the claim that he "is lying about his own record. The rating of Ohio's investment fund has NOT improved." Ohio's investment fund has not improved under Mandel. And a natural reading of that claim is that Mandel at some point claimed it had improved. Except in the materials the Brown campaign cited in support of the ad, Mandel doesn’t actually say the rating went up. But that’s the clear implication the ad makes when it says he is now lying about his record. And PolitiFact Ohio has never heard him make that claim. PolitiFact Ohio previously rated as Mostly True the claim by Mandel's campaign that he "earned the highest possible credit ratings" for investment funds managed by the treasurer's office. We found that the claim needed additional information for clarification, but that it was accurate. When we rated Mandel’s claim in his email Half True for overstatement, that was for his use of the words ""just received," which we said could give the impression that the rating was new. He did not say in that email that the rating for the STAR Ohio fund had gone up. While the claims put the best possible spin on Mandel's performance, they do not qualify as "lying about his record." In that regard, the suggestion from the ad that he said the rating increased is just deceptive and incorrect. On the Truth-O-Meter, the Brown campaign ad’s claim rates False.

pomt-00286	West Virginia University’s incoming freshman class has the "highest-ever GPA"	mostly true	/west-virginia/statements/2018/sep/28/e-gordon-gee/does-west-virginia-universitys-incoming-freshman-c/	Is West Virginia University’s freshman class this year the smartest ever? The question came up as part of an ongoing dispute between West Virginia University and fraternities over student safety. In February, WVU President Gordon Gee released a statement charting a course for future relations between the university and Greek organizations. "Fraternities and sororities are acquiring an increasingly toxic reputation among parents, employers and members of the public," Gee wrote in the Feb. 15, 2018 letter. "At West Virginia University, we are not waiting for the next tragic death, arrest or headline-grabbing incident to prompt our action. When it comes to student misconduct in our fraternities and sororities, the time to act is now." Later in his letter, Gee wrote that following a student death in 2014, "we have had great success in changing our overall student culture to emphasize working smart and playing smart. The result has been a rise in student academic qualifications. Last fall, for example, on our Morgantown campus we welcomed our biggest class of Honors College freshmen ever, as well as our largest overall freshman class, with the highest-ever GPA." Friction between the university and fraternities has continued: Several fraternities threatened to bolt from university oversight, and during the first week of the semester in August, Gee sent a letter to parents asking them to "discourage" students from rushing unaffiliated fraternities. In this article, we aren’t going to fact-check the fraternity controversy, but one portion of Gee’s earlier letter caught our eye. Is it true that WVU’s current freshman class has the "highest-ever GPA" in the university’s history, as Gee wrote? On the university’s website, it says that "the average student enrolled in WVU’s Fall 2018 freshman class had a 3.55 high school GPA, an ACT score of 24 and a combined Math and Critical Reading SAT score of 1133. Stephen Lee, WVU’s associate vice president of enrollment management and executive director of admissions and recruitment, provided PolitiFact with a partial run of older data. The data Lee provided shows that average GPAs for the previous three years were 3.47 for the freshmen of 2017, 3.46 for the freshmen of 2016, and 3.45 for the freshmen of 2015. Here’s a chart summarizing the data from Lee: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The data shows a steady increase in the freshman GPA, but the data goes back only to 1995. So we can’t independently confirm that this fall’s freshmen have the highest GPAs "ever." Meanwhile, the data also showed a post-1995 high for SAT and ACT standardized test scores for incoming freshmen in 2018. Our ruling Gee wrote that WVU’s incoming freshman class for 2018 has the "highest-ever GPA" in the university’s history. The incoming freshman GPA is the highest since 1995, according to data provided by the university, and given the steady rise since 1995, it’s plausible that the current class’ GPA is the highest in the university’s history. But we do not have data that independently confirms that. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	E.

pomt-11835	"Supreme Court issues its first bench warrant ever."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/nov/09/freedomjunkshuncom/fake-news-story-says-supreme-court-issues-bogus-wa/	A fake news story spread by a liberal troll website said the U.S. Supreme Court issued a bench warrant for the arrest in a fictional case against the Treasury Department. "Supreme Court issues its first bench warrant ever," read the headline on a Nov. 6, 2017, post on FreeInfoMedia.com. We saw the same article on the same day posted to FreedomJunkshun.com, the fake news site where it originated. Facebook users reported both posts as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to curb fake news. We also saw the same story on other sites. The fake story said that Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas had issued the warrant to compel a man named Donald M. Allard to testify "on a case involving the Treasury Department’s mishandling of funds during the Obama administration." A bench warrant is a written order by a judge authorizing the police to find someone and bring them to court. The story said Allard, described as "a close friend and college activist friend of Barack Obama," had previously been found in contempt in two fictional courts. The Supreme Court wanted him to answer whether he was "ordered by the chief executive to transfer funds from the trust fund to the general fund without the approval of Congress," the story said. There is no warrant, of course, just as there is no such case before the Supreme Court. The story is completely bogus. FreedomJunkshun.com is a member of a series of fake websites associated with Christopher Blair, who lives in Maine. Blair is a self-described liberal troll who creates fictional stories to try to fool conservative readers. The website uses a similar layout and style as other Blair-affiliated sites and carries a disclaimer that reads, "All people, places, names and images should be considered fictitious or fictitious representations." Just to be sure the assertions in the story were fake, we asked a couple of legal experts whether there was any sort of case like the one described, or if the court had issued any bench warrants. Tom Goldstein, who runs SCOTUSblog.com with his wife Amy Howe, told us that "every possible aspect of that is fiction." Ilya Shapiro, senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he was unaware of any bench warrant ever being issued by the Supreme Court. "Bench warrants are issued to cause the arrest of someone who violated a court rule or showed contempt for the court, so in theory the Supreme Court could indeed issue one. But I’ve never heard of it," Shapiro said. "Even in the handful of recent protest cases, the Supreme Court marshals or Capitol Police simply arrest the people on their pre-existent authority to do so." As a final note, we have to point out the tomfoolery surrounding the name of the supposed witness, Donald M. Allard. The letters of the name elide into Donald Mallard, which appears to be an allusion to Donald Duck. This is another fake story full of preposterous details cooked up by a network of trolls to fool people. We rate it Pants on Fire!

pomt-01557	Says President Obama "has never made a statement ... that he wanted a residual force left (in Iraq)."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/12/john-mccain/mccain-obama-never-said-he-wanted-leave-troops-ira/	Questions about what President Barack Obama should do in Iraq now have lately been overshadowed by another question: Should Obama have left troops in Iraq after the war ended? Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has advocated for keeping residual forces in the country since he visited its capital, Baghdad, in late 2008 -- right after losing the presidential election to Obama. And he continues to argue that Obama made the wrong decision to remove all American troops from Iraq by the end of 2011. McCain repeated this point on Sept. 10, appearing on several news shows after Obama announced his strategy to combat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria -- the militant Islamic group that has taken control of several cities in Iraq and has beheaded two American journalists. On CNN, he sparred with former White House Press Secretary Jay Carney. Carney said the decision to withdraw had been "the right approach" and said the Iraqi government had played a role in that decision. "You know, Mr. Carney, you are again saying facts that are patently false," McCain said. "The fact is, because (Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.) and I, and (former Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn.) were in Baghdad. (The Iraqis) wanted a residual force. The president has never made a statement, during that or after, that he wanted a residual force left behind." It’s impossible to know for certain what the Iraqi government wanted, and we have limited information about conversations that happened behind closed doors in the White House. But we can check what Obama said publicly about leaving troops behind. As far as we can tell, McCain’s right. Throughout the first few years of his presidency, Obama did not make a public statement in which he clearly expressed that he wanted to keep troops in Iraq after the agreed upon withdrawal date. Promises, promises First, some background. Ending the war in Iraq was one of Obama’s principal campaign promises, and he kept that promise by removing combat troops by the end of 2010 and all other troops by the end of 2011. Obama announced his own draw-down plans a month after taking office. "Let me say this as plainly as I can: By Aug. 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end," he said Feb. 27, 2009. He also said he would keep between 35,000 to 50,000 military personnel there through the end of 2011 to train and advise Iraqi military and for counterterrorism purposes. The 2011 deadline was spelled out in a 2008 Status of Forces Agreement between the George W. Bush administration and that of then-Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki (who recently stepped down). What matters for this fact-check is what happened to American troops in Iraq after Jan. 1, 2012. There was public debate among leaders on that issue throughout 2011. Military commanders in Washington and in Baghdad pushed for a residual force of between 16,000 and 24,000 to conduct counterrorism work and train Iraqi security forces. The White House, reports show, was not open to a force that size, though they considered leaving up to 10,000 troops -- a controversial pitch that would have required approval from Iraq’s divided government to change the 2008 agreement. However, the New York Times detailed how the one-time goal of a 10,000-person force shrank before negotiations failed altogether. According to the New York Times, "the new goal would be a continuous presence of about 3,500 troops, a rotating force of up to 1,500 and half a dozen F-16’s." But this was all behind closed doors and only came out later, so let’s look at what Obama said publicly. Talking points Although some White House officials spoke to the media anonymously about the potential to keep residual forces in Iraq, we found no circumstance in which Obama himself talked about this as a possibility. And if he had, it would have clashed with his usual talking points. We read quite a few of Obama’s speeches and remarks from 2009, 2010 and 2011, and he repeatedly touted the complete removal of combat troops and the upcoming withdrawal of all remaining forces. Here’s a sampling: In a speech at Cairo University in 2009, Obama said, "Iraq's sovereignty is its own. And that's why I ordered the removal of our combat brigades by next August. That is why we will honor our agreement with Iraq's democratically elected government to remove combat troops from Iraqi cities by July, and to remove all of our troops from Iraq by 2012." In August 2010, he announced the removal of all combat troops from his Oval Office desk. Then he said, "Consistent with our agreement with the Iraqi government, all U.S. troops will leave by the end of next year." Almost exactly a year later, in August 2011, at the American Legion Conference, he said, "Having ended our combat mission in Iraq and removed more than 100,000 troops so far, we’ll remove the rest of our troops by the end of this year, and we will end that war." And on Oct. 21, 2011, following the final negotiations with Maliki, Obama said, "Last year, I announced the end to our combat mission in Iraq. And to date, we’ve removed more than 100,000 troops. … So today, I can report that, as promised, the rest of our troops in Iraq will come home by the end of the year. After nearly nine years, America’s war in Iraq will be over." A spokeswoman with the National Security Council did, though, point us to Obama’s president-elect platform from 2008, which said, "a residual force will remain in Iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter-terrorism missions against al Qaeda in Iraq and protect American diplomatic and civilian personnel." However, it’s possible that this was referring to the transitional forces that would stay between the end of the combat mission in 2010 and the complete withdrawal in 2011. Obama also said in a June 19, 2014, press conference, "We offered a modest residual force to help continue to train and advise Iraqi security forces." But as far as we can tell, if this is the case, he did not talk about this to the public during the negotiations. In fact, Carney, who was Obama’s press secretary then, said something of the opposite to the press. Throughout the summer of 2011, Carney told reporters that they would consider leaving forces in Iraq if, and only if, the Iraqi government requested it. But otherwise, they would go ahead with the agreed upon plan and leave by the end of 2011. "We continue to work under the status of forces agreement that we have with the Iraqi government, that will result in full withdrawal of U.S. troops by the end of this year," Carney said in August 2011, in response to a question of whether or not the withdrawal was slowing down. "We have said in the past that we will listen to -- consider any request that the Iraqi government might have to further our engagement with Iraq militarily, just in terms of what we might do there. But that has not been forthcoming, and we are on track to withdraw by the end of the year." Our ruling McCain said Obama "has never made a statement ... that he wanted a residual force left (in Iraq)." Obama’s president-elect platform made a vague comment about leaving residual forces, and it seems that the White House -- behind closed doors -- considered it extensively. But we found no public statements of Obama saying he wanted to leave troops in Iraq past the agreed upon withdrawal date in the months leading up the war’s end. He repeatedly asserted that troops would be out of Iraq by the end of 2011. McCain’s claim is accurate but requires additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-03737	In South Carolina, women earn 76 cents on the dollar to men’s earnings.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/apr/12/elizabeth-colbert-busch/gender-wage-gap-claim-needs-more-context/	Next month, South Carolina voters head to the polls for a special election to select a new representative for the U.S. House in the state’s 1st Congressional District. The race between former Gov. Mark Sanford, a Republican candidate known for his infamous antics, and Elizabeth Colbert Busch, a Democratic candidate known for her talk-show host brother’s antics, has garnered national attention for Georgia’s next-door neighbor. This week, Colbert Busch tried to capitalize on Sanford’s poor reputation with women, while pushing for equity in employee pay. The Colbert Busch campaign did not return a call and an email for comment. "In South Carolina, women earn 76 cents on the dollar to men’s earnings," the candidate said in a news release. She went on to say that "I am committed to making sure that women earn the same pay for the same work." PolitiFact has heard and examined similar wage gap claims before. We decided to revisit the claim and check any new material available on the subject to see whether Colbert Busch’s claim was correct. Colbert Busch made her comments about the wage gap on Equal Pay Day. That day symbolizes how many months after one year a woman must work, on average, to earn as much as a man earned that same one year. In conjunction with Equal Pay Day, the National Partnership for Women and Families released a report examining the pay gap in the states and 50 largest metropolitan areas. For South Carolina, the group found that women in general are paid 76 cents for every dollar paid to men. The report is based on census data of full-time, year-round workers. The NPWF used the study to push for passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act to prevent pay discrimination. Colbert Busch’s figure is correct, and based on numerous studies that have controlled for factors like education level and time on the job and they still cannot explain the gender wage gap, said Drucilla Barker, a professor of women’s and gender studies at the University of South Carolina. "Women and men do different kinds of work and in general women’s work pays less than men’s work," she said. "The question then becomes ‘why?’" Last year, a National Women’s Law Center report provided a state-by-state ranking comparing median earnings for both genders for full-time, year-round workers, regardless of occupation, based on census data. The report found that in 2011 in South Carolina, women earned 75.6 cents for every dollar earned by a man. The state gaps follow the often-repeated national data that shows women earning 77 cents to every dollar a man earns.The 77-cent figure is derived from a 2010 census report comparing female-to-male earnings ratio of full-time, year-round workers. But that report compares all workers, regardless of occupation and other factors such as education level and time on the job. It has been used widely to support eliminating gender discrimination. Last June, in a campaign ad, President Barack Obama claimed that women are "paid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men." Obama neglected to include employee factors such as education level, occupation and time on the job in his analysis, and received a Mostly False rating for oversimplifying his statement. A few months later, Colorado legislator Diana DeGette received a Mostly True rating for her claim that women "receive only 77 cents for every dollar a man earns" because she did not use the "same work as men" qualifier. The 23-cent gap has been challenged by economists and policy groups who say the gap is much smaller when factors such as education, type of job and experience level are considered. This week, the Independent Women’s Forum, a conservative nonprofit group, posted a video about the gap, calling it inaccurate, and saying that proposed laws to close the perceived gap will lead to undue government regulation. In October, a study by the American Association of University Women, which advocates for equity for women and girls, analyzed men’s and women’s earnings one year after graduation. Study authors maintain that a wage gap for almost all occupations still exists. When taking qualifiers such as education, training, age and parental status into account, women in 2009 still earned 6.6 percent less than men, the study concluded. This unexplained gap could be attributed to gender discrimination and women’s ability to negotiate salaries, the report found. An AAUW researcher noted that the wage gap can grow as careers progress. How much of a pay gap between women and men is due to discrimination against women is unclear, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. "But a fair-minded person should certainly take account of hours worked per week before calculating the earnings penalty of being a women. It is less clear how much of the occupational difference, the job tenure difference and the work experience difference between women and men we should take into account." Our conclusion: Colbert Busch said that in South Carolina, women earn 76 cents on the dollar to men’s earnings. PolitiFact has examined similar wage gap claims several times over the past couple of years. During that time, the data used to make the claims has been reviewed extensively. Each time, we have noted that some studies reporting the larger gaps do not take into account several variables impacting pay, including types of occupations, age of employee, education and training, hours worked and duration on the job. That is the case with the claim made by Colbert Busch. Making such a blanket statement without the context of the qualifiers is disingenuous. There is a wage gap between men and women. She is right about that. But most studies indicate it tends to diminish when other factors are considered. Colbert Busch’s claim is accurate, but it leaves out substantial context that would give the reader a different impression. We rated Colbert Busch’s claim Half True.

pomt-12114	"(For) white working-class America, death rates among white men are up 20 percent."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/20/alex-castellanos/death-rates-white-men-20-percent-gop-strategist-sa/	President Donald Trump’s supporters continue to back him because they felt so besieged by the political landscape and life in general that it’s literally killing them, a GOP strategist said on ABC’s This Week. Alex Castellanos, who has worked as a consultant for George W. Bush and Mitt Romney, said during an Aug. 20, 2017, discussion on the show that Trump’s backers have stuck with him through controversies because they didn’t see an alternative option. Democrats attacking Trump’s response to violence in Charlottesville, Va., just fed into growing bitterness among his base over their dire socioeconomic situation, he said. "What I think a lot of Trump supporters heard this week was, the Democrats are just painting us, Trump supporters, with a Nazi brush. We're all white supremacists. That's their excuse for why they lost the election," Castellanos said. "No. White working-class America, death rates among white men are up 20 percent. They're unemployed. Gwen Ifill said, ‘no wonder they're resentful.’" We wondered about his statistic that working-class white men are dying at a higher rate than before. It turns out that researchers have identified increasing mortality among the white working class, but it’s not as high for men as the 20 percent number Castellanos cited. Increased mortality rates In response to our questions, Castellanos sent us two articles from the New York Times and the Guardian about a 2015 paper by husband-and-wife Princeton economists Angus Deaton and Anne Case. Their research showed that death rates for middle-aged, white Americans had been going up, while they had been going down for every other age, race and ethnic group. Those rates also had been falling in other countries. This was a reversal of a years-long trend in which mortality rates had been steadily decreasing, meaning that Americans across many groups were living longer. From 1978 to 1998, white Americans were seeing mortality rates fall about 2 percent each year. So the fact that Case and Deaton found an increase was considered significant. But Deaton told us the 20 percent number Castellanos cited for men was too high. (That’s a number the Guardian reported, but it cites the increase as being for "the death rate for white Americans aged 45 to 54.") "In our 2015 PNAS paper, we say that for all white non-Hispanics (men and women together), mortality rates for those aged 45 to 54 rose at half of one percent per year, which from 1998 to 2013 is 7.8 percent, not 20 percent, and certainly not 20 percent for men only," Deaton wrote via email. Case added that that was for all levels of education, not just people who didn’t have a college degree. Deaton and Case’s study showed that mortality rates were climbing for white, non-Hispanic Americans aged 45 to 54 with a high school education or less. The research further showed that deaths were up from drug and alcohol poisonings, suicides, chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis. Mortality rates rose for all education groups, but "those with less education saw the most marked increases," the paper read. It’s important to note that overall mortality rates for African-Americans were still higher than whites. But African-Americans still recorded an overall drop in the same time period, not an increase. Researchers were surprised by the Case and Deaton study in 2015. Dartmouth economists Ellen Meara and Jonathan Skinner said in an analysis that while most Americans’ life expectancies had gone up in the face of the Great Recession and rising income inequality, the study’s findings "dashed even this cautiously optimistic view of the past several decades." "These trends are indeed concentrated among the least educated Americans who never attended college," Meara told PolitiFact. "Of note, the trends do not apply to current retirees, nor youth, both groups that have experienced mortality improvements in recent decades." Others questioned the paper’s results. Columbia University statistics professor Andrew Gelman argued that the situation wasn’t as dire as it first appeared. He said that some statistical adjustments showed that middle-aged white women largely made up the difference in mortality rates, and the figures evened out when you combined men and women. Deaton and Case addressed some of these doubts in a 2017 follow-up to their paper. While the 2015 data didn’t focus on differences between men and women, their latest work did, along with adjusting their age groups. "For non-Hispanic white men aged 30 to 59 without a four-year college degree, age-adjusted all-cause mortality rose by 7 percent from 1998 to 2015," Deaton said of the latest data. Again they found that a lack of education was a major factor for increasing mortality rates, among other issues. (Gelman and Jonathan Auerbach, a Columbia doctoral student, again disputed their findings.) "We propose a preliminary but plausible story in which cumulative disadvantage from one birth cohort to the next, in the labor market, in marriage and child outcomes, and in health, is triggered by progressively worsening labor market opportunities at the time of entry for whites with low levels of education," the 2017 paper read. There’s evidence that whites with less education on the lower end of the income spectrum didn’t make up the bulk of Trump’s voters. The Washington Post reported that his base is largely affluent Republicans, whether they have a college education or not. Deaton said Castellanos was speaking too broadly, and the spirit of his comment misses what the research really says. "To be fair, that mortality rates are going up at all is a big deal, and is a measure of the fact that bad things are happening to these people," he said. Our ruling Castellanos said that for the white working class, "death rates among white men are up 20 percent." Research has shown that death rates are up for white men, which is a cause for concern because death rates have historically declined. But that research is not without controversy. Also, the researchers who documented the increase in death rates say it’s not as alarmingly high as 20 percent just for white men. A more accurate estimate would be around 7 percent. Castellanos has a point about increased death rates among whites, but he incorrectly cited figures from the study. We rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-06459	"A Cornell University research study concludes that ethanol generates a 29 percent energy loss, meaning it takes more than a gallon of gasoline to produce a gallon of ethanol."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/oct/19/matt-gaetz/rep-matt-gaetz-says-ethanol-study-shows-its-not-wo/	Florida's ethanol mandate has been in place less than a year, and a Panhandle Republican plans to push for its repeal. Rep. Matt Gaetz, who lives in the coastal community of Fort Walton Beach, argues corn-based fuel takes more energy to make than it generates. "A Cornell University research study concludes that ethanol generates a 29 percent energy loss, meaning it takes more than a gallon of gasoline to produce a gallon of ethanol," he wrote in a recent Pensacola News Journal op-ed. A PolitiFact Florida reader sent a link our way. We were curious: Has an Ivy League researcher found ethanol to be an energy loser? We were especially curious because the U.S. Department of Energy says the majority of such studies about ethanol's "net energy balance," especially more recent ones, show the opposite. So, of course, does the renewable fuels industry. First, a little background. The Florida law, passed in 2008, has required since Dec. 31, 2010, that most gasoline include 9 percent to 10 percent "agriculturally derived" fuel. Lawmakers said they wanted to boost renewable energy that would cut greenhouse gas emissions and reduce reliance on foreign oil. But boaters in Gaetz's district were ready to "get out the pitchforks," he said. The law doesn't apply to gas sold for small engines or boats. Still, some boaters who used the mix, known as E10, found it would rot out fuel lines and gunk up carburetors. Gaetz, propelled by angry constituents, did some research — and now has a file in his Tallahassee office to support legislation to turn back the mandate. He sent us a news release from Cornell News Service, "Cornell ecologist's study finds that producing ethanol and biodiesel from corn and other crops is not worth the energy." That appears to give Gaetz's claim strong roots. So does the study itself, which said "to produce a liter of (corn) ethanol requires 29 percent more fossil energy than is produced as ethanol." Researchers included all kinds of "energy inputs" required to produce fuel from corn — more than a dozen just to grow the corn in the first place, from production of pesticides and nitrogen fertilizer to construction of farm equipment to food for farmworkers. (The authors argue that government and industry studies don't take enough "energy inputs" into account, which is why they get a different result.) All the fossil energy, from natural gas to liquid fuel to coal, got totaled up and explained as "gasoline equivalents." That's a little more nuanced than Gaetz's claim that a study said it takes "gasoline" to produce ethanol. But it's close. Still, the study was from 2005. Did Gaetz quote an outdated statistic to make his point? We chatted with one of the researchers, David Pimentel, an emeritus professor in agriculture and life sciences at Cornell. We read him Gaetz's claim. "Yeah, that's correct," Pimentel said. "We have more up-to-date data, though. ... "It would be 1.5 gallons of gasoline equivalents to produce 1 gallon of ethanol. So this is even worse." In other words, Gaetz cited an old number. But more recent work from the same researchers would have even better demonstrated his point. That's scarcely statistical malfeasance. What about the fact that Pimentel's research flies in the face of government and industry studies? We would have preferred Gaetz note that in his op-ed, but Pimentel's a widely cited biofuel skeptic whose work is addressed by USDA researchers and weighed by other Ivy League energy experts. That makes Pimentel's work the subject of legitimate discussion. This fact-check doesn't attempt to evaluate the science itself, but whether Gaetz accurately characterized a scientific study when he wrote, "a Cornell University research study concludes that ethanol generates a 29 percent energy loss, meaning it takes more than a gallon of gasoline to produce a gallon of ethanol." We found the study and talked with the Cornell researcher, who said Gaetz accurately cited him. Still, we're concerned readers might think it literally takes gasoline — rather than gasoline "equivalents" — to produce ethanol. Meanwhile, with the Ivy League appeal of Gaetz's statistic, it might appear to represent settled scientific consensus. In fact, researchers battle from paper to paper — and Pimentel's in the minority. So, the op-ed claim was accurate, but needs some clarification. That's our definition of Mostly True.

pomt-01943	"For the cost of the Iraq War we could’ve ended world hunger for 30 years."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/24/facebook-posts/facebook-meme-iraq-war-dollars-could-have-ended-wo/	As sectarian fighting in Iraq spreads, there’s a Facebook meme that captures the public’s frustration with the relative costs and benefits of America’s military intervention in that country. The image makes a simple claim. "For the cost of the Iraq War we could’ve ended world hunger for 30 years," it says. Lee Camp, a stand-up comedian and host of the RT show Redacted Tonight, posted it on his Facebook page. Camp said he didn’t come up with the message, but it made sense to him. "I looked up (the) numbers and found that the Iraq War has cost us $2 trillion since 2003," Camp said. "The UN estimates ending world hunger each year would cost $30 billion. So ending world hunger since 2003 would have cost $330 billion." There are a few problems with the numbers, however. First, pinpointing the cost of the war in Iraq isn’t so black-and-white. The $2 trillion figure, for instance, includes future health care and disability costs for veterans. Second, many experts find the claim that $30 billion a year can end world hunger dubious, including one of the world’s leading hunger advocacy groups. Make no mistake, the money would help. But would it end world hunger? We’ll dig into the numbers. Cost of the Iraq War The big debate in tallying the cost of the Iraq War centers on whether the total should include the projected expense of caring for veterans. Adding future health costs boosts the total by anywhere from well over $300 billion to $1 trillion. The direct military, and security, costs are easier to identify. Here are the numbers we found: Congressional Budget Office: $774 billion for direct military spending through 2014. Congressional Research Service: $806 billion, direct military spending and including Veterans Administration spending to date, through 2011. Brown University - Cost of War Project: $770 billion for direct military spending; $40 billion current health costs; $490 billion future health care costs. The total of all costs, including interest on debt and homeland security and more, is $2.2 trillion. Joseph E. Stiglitz and Linda J. Bilmes, co-authors of co-authors of The Three Trillion Dollar War: The True Cost of the Iraq Conflict: At least $3 trillion, including all current and future costs. New York Times: $872 billion for direct military spending and $26 for billion current health care costs through September 2011; $340 billion for future health care costs. The total for these categories is $1.2 trillion. Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments: $900 billion for direct military spending and current health care costs. "The future cost of veterans’ benefits and services due to Iraq veterans could well exceed the direct cost of the war itself -- a trillion dollars or more," said Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the center. The tallies show a wide range. The lowest, $774 billion, comes from the CBO but includes no veterans health care costs. The higher estimates, in the neighborhood of $3 trillion, include a long list of costs that span from 2001 to decades in the future. Cost to end world hunger If we took the highest cost estimates for the war, that would provide about $70 billion annually over 30 years. No one questions that those funds could do a lot of good. But beyond that, the data support little more. The estimate that $30 billion could end world hunger for a year comes from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. In 2008, Senegalese diplomat and director-general Jacques Diouf made an appeal to help the millions of people who are hungry across the globe. "How can we explain to people of good sense and good faith that it was not possible to find $30 billion a year to enable 862 million hungry people to enjoy the most fundamental of human rights: the right to food and thus the right to life?" Diouf asked. Multiply $30 billion by 30 years and you have $900 billion. That’s less than several but not all of the estimated costs of the Iraq War -- without factoring in inflation. But a host of experts we talked to agreed that the $30 billion a year figure is impossible to verify and likely incorrect. (The UN Food and Agriculture Organization did not respond to our request for more information about where their estimate comes from.) Part of the problem is counting how many people are in a state of hunger. The UN World Food Programme says the figure is 842 million. The UN Millennium Development Goals project puts the number at 1.02 billion. Part of the problem is trying to estimate what it would take to lift everyone out of hunger. "I don't believe in the UN claim," said William Easterly, a development economist and co-director of New York University’s Development Research Institute. "The numbers on the extent of world hunger are notoriously unreliable. There is only fragmentary data on stunting and wasting in children, the only direct measure of hunger." Oxfam America, the national chapter of one of the leading global organizations in the fight against hunger and poverty, is also skeptical. "We at Oxfam do not have a figure for the price tag to end hunger and we are not aware of any credible recent figures," said Laura Rusu, an Oxfam spokeswoman. Liz Young researches world hunger at Staffordshire University in England and is the author of the book Food and Development. Young said the claim is "impossible to substantiate." "Such assertions are normally made by activists to make a point, often a very reasonable point, but such assertions stretch the science a little," Young said. Harold Alderman is a senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute, a Washington group focused on practical solutions to hunger and poverty. Like Young, Alderman doubts the claim but supports the general thrust behind it. "I am not sure that, counting administration and leakage, that that would quite work to completely end hunger for each person in each year," Alderman said. "But I am fairly confident that it would go a long way towards this goal, especially if over time the number of those in need declines." Alderman added that there are 10 relatively low-cost approaches that have a proven track record in reducing malnutrition in children and he is very confident that the Iraq War could have paid for those with money to spare. One of the analytic hurdles in this claim lies in its choice of words. If the Facebook post had said the Iraq War could have ended hunger 30 times over, it would have been on slightly firmer ground. As it is, it makes a claim based on the state of global hunger over the next 30 years. Our experts noted that a lot could happen in 30 years to change the dynamics -- from regional armed conflicts, to the effects on food production from climate change. Our ruling The Facebook post said the money spent on the Iraq War would have ended world hunger for 30 years. While a back-of-envelope calculation gives the claim a superficial appearance of accuracy, below the surface it lacks substance. We found no advocacy group or expert who expressed confidence in the estimates of the total number of people who suffer from hunger or in any estimate of what it would cost to end it. A majority felt that the dollars spent on war would have helped a good deal, but the funds would still fall short of the goal. The claim uses the appearance of mathematical accuracy to support a bold vision of the future, but that does not make it more sound. We rate the claim Half True. Correction: An earlier version of this fact-check misspelled the name of Oxfam spokeswoman Laura Rusu.	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2014-06-24T12:00:02	2014-06-16	['None']
pomt-10388	"John McCain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming ... five years ago."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/17/john-mccain/mccain-spoke-up-early/	A new TV ad from the McCain campaign portrays the Arizona senator as a leader in the fight against global warming. The ad begins with fast-paced music and horns honking. It shows black-and-white scenes of crowded freeways, smokestacks belching and a glacier collapsing. "John McCain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming . . . five years ago," the narrator says. The stark black-and-white scenes are replaced by more pleasant color footage of a wind turbine against a bright blue sky and water flowing through a dam. "Today, he has a realistic plan that will curb greenhouse gas emissions. A plan that will help grow our economy and protect our environment." With images such as a newspaper headline that says "McCain climate views clash with GOP," the ad portrays McCain as an independent voice on climate change. Indeed, the Congressional Record shows that McCain spoke up about global warming in January 2003. And as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, he held hearings on the issue several years before that. On Jan. 9, 2003, McCain and Sen. Joe Liberman introduced the Lieberman-McCain Climate Stewardship Act, which sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by capping them and allowing companies and utilities to sell or trade their emission rights. When he introduced the bill, McCain called it "the first comprehensive piece of legislation" in capping emissions. "The U.S. is responsible for 25 percent of the worldwide greenhouse gas emissions," he said. "It is time for the U.S. government to do its part to address this global problem, and legislation on mandatory reductions is the form of leadership that is required to address this global problem." By contrast, the Bush administration has opposed cap-and-trade programs and preferred voluntary efforts on climate change. Manik Roy, director of congressional affairs for the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said McCain had actually been working on the climate change bill in 2001, but it got delayed after the 9/11 attacks. The Lieberman-McCain bill ultimately failed in October 2003 by a 43-55 vote, but Roy said it was a key step in "educating the Senate" about how government could respond to global warming. "It is absolutely correct that McCain stood up on this issue, forced the Senate to focus on this issue when nobody else thought it made sense and did it with strong opposition from the White House," Roy said. He called McCain "a huge leader on this issue in the Senate." And so we find McCain's statement to be True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-06-17T00:00:00	2008-06-17	['None']
pomt-06817	"Two elections in a row (Waukesha County Clerk Kathy Nickolaus) has screwed up counting the vote"	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2011/aug/11/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/democratic-party-wisconsin-chairman-mike-tate-says/	On the brink of falling one victory short of taking back the state Senate, state Democratic Party Chairman Mike Tate blamed a familiar punching bag late on election night. Tate lashed out at Waukesha County Clerk Kathy Nickolaus, whose April 2011 failure to include an entire municipality’s unofficial vote count in the Supreme Court contest for more than a day led Democrats to falsely believe their preferred candidate, JoAnne Kloppenburg, had won. This time around, there was no such delay, but partial election-night returns from one community in the county were among the last reported. Those figures from Menomonee Falls, a GOP stronghold, would ultimately reverse the early "lead" in unofficial returns that recall challenger state Rep. Sandy Pasch (D-Whitefish Bay) had over state Sen. Alberta Darling (R-River Hills). While the Menomonee Falls totals were still out, Tate told a WISN-TV interviewer on Aug. 9, 2011 that "this is an election that Sandy Pasch has won" and that Nickolaus "at worst is conducting criminal voter fraud" amid some "very questionable activities." He didn’t stop there. "Look, this should be a concern shared by everybody who lives in Waukesha County," Tate said. "Two elections in a row she has screwed up counting the vote. Regardless if you are a Republican or a Democrat you should know that your vote is going to count." Those are, to say the least, pretty strong statements. But they weren’t just off-the-cuff remarks in the midst of a live interview. The party immediately issued a news release (Headline: "Waukesha County Tampering") charging that Nickolaus "is once more tampering with the results of a consequential election and in the next hours we will determine our next course of action. For now, Wisconsin should know that a dark cloud hangs over these important results." Let’s pause this tape and look at the process. Given the party’s continued criticism, we thought it was important to see if Nickolaus, as Tate claimed, "screwed up counting the vote" for the second time in a row. We asked Tate what evidence he had to back his claim of tampering with the election. He said suspicions were raised because the Waukesha vote totals were among the last to come in statewide on a night with six Senate recall elections. (Democrats unseated two GOP incumbents, falling one shy of regaining control of the Senate). The most important word in his claim is the "counting" part. County clerks such as Nickolaus don’t count any ballots on election night. That’s up to the municipal clerks who supervise polls in their community. County clerks receive reports from municipalities, which send in their unofficial returns on election night. They are double-checked later later when they are certified by the county’s Board of Canvassers. (In the April election, Nickolaus posted one final number for the county, not municipality-by-municipality numbers, which helped conceal the missing community for days. A recount confirmed Justice David Prosser won by about 7,000 votes. Since then, Nickolaus has been posting community-by-community numbers as they come in, as she did during the Aug. 9 election) Two Waukesha County communities are in the 8th Senate District: Butler and Menomonee Falls. Butler sent in totals within 35 minutes of close of polls at 8 p.m., and those were posted early in the evening. But Menomonee Falls Clerk Janice Moyer told us that heavy turnout there prevented tabulation of absentee ballots in some cases until after polls closed. "It takes time, and we want them to do it correctly," Moyer said of poll workers. Nickolaus did not get most of the Menomonee Falls count until 10:36 p.m., according to Moyer. Nickolaus said results were posted on the county’s web site by 10:47 p.m. The last batch came in an hour later, and Nickolaus said she posted them within six minutes. So the gap in reporting Waukesha County results was not due to Nickolaus, who posts and tallies the totals but does not count the votes. What’s more, a staggered flow of returns is common on election nights, as each community finishes its count. Other communities were still out when Tate made his statement, including on turf that Pasch won in Brown Deer in Milwaukee County. And even in the races Democrats won, all precincts had not yet reported when victory was declared. What about Tate’s contention of a "second time" Nickolaus messed up a vote count? Nickolaus admitted a mistake in the Supreme Court race, but investigators found no vote-tampering. She failed to include Brookfield in the total she released that night, but that error was not related to counting the votes -- just reporting the totals she received from locals. It looked suspicious, and caused a firestorm. But it involved the unofficial count only and did not affect the official vote count released days after that election. In the state Senate race, as the realization settled in early Wednesday morning that Darling would win with 54 percent of the vote, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin issued a retraction of sorts that it "would not pursue questions of irregularities." But it threw fuel on the fire about the results, contending -- erroneously -- that the race was a "virtual tie." And in a day-after media conference call, Tate again criticized Nickolaus, saying she had arguably been "sitting on these results." In that call, Tate responded to a questioner who asked if he felt he had defamed Nickolaus. Tate responded that he has said a lot of things in his two years as party chairman. He added: "If that’s what’s going to be called defamatory, I guess I’m willing to stand by that." So, we’ll return to the original remarks as well. In claiming Nickolaus "screwed up counting the vote" for the second election in a row, Tate offered no proof that the numbers that eventually came in were off. Nor did he offer proof she was "sitting on" votes -- much less "tampering" or "conducting criminal voter fraud" on election night. This claim is inaccurate and, in the "heat of the moment" as he put it, Tate made a ridiculous claim. In this case, where there’s heat, there’s fire: Pants on Fire.

pomt-02004	"We came out of the White House not only dead broke, but in debt."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/10/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-she-and-bill-were-dead-broke/	Hillary Clinton is walking the line between being remarkably successful and yet still in touch with the lives of ordinary people. The former secretary of state and potential 2016 presidential candidate has found herself trying to limit blowback to her claim that she and husband Bill were "dead broke" when they left the White House. She made the comment during an interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer. Sawyer pressed Clinton on a reported haul of $5 million in speaking fees. "You have no reason to remember, but we came out of the White House not only dead broke, but in debt," Clinton said. "We had no money when we got there, and we struggled to piece together the resources for mortgages for houses, for Chelsea's education. It was not easy. Bill has worked really hard. And it's been amazing to me. He's worked very hard." Republicans called the claim laughable and the next day Clinton clarified, again on ABC, that she and Bill had done very well over the past 14 years. "We have a life experience that is clearly different in very dramatic ways from many Americans," Clinton said. "But we also have gone through some of the same challenges many people have." We wanted to take a closer look at Clinton’s claim of being "dead broke" when their time in the White House ended after December 2000. The Clintons’ balance sheet Clinton’s 2000 Senate financial disclosure form, via the Open Secrets website, provides a rough view of the balance between the couple’s assets and liabilities. These forms only show amounts in broad ranges -- from $15,001 to $50,000, from $50,001 to $100,000 and so forth -- but under any set of assumptions, the Clintons were in the red, a problem driven by Bill Clinton’s enormous legal bills. Their highest possible assets totaled about $1.8 million, while their lowest possible debts were nearly $2.3 million. The most optimistic scenario left them in a hole of about $500,000. But the federal disclosure form does not include homes used for personal use and the Clintons owned two. In 1999, they bought a five-bedroom home in Chappaqua, N.Y., for $1.7 million. In December 2000, just as they were leaving the White House, they bought a seven-bedroom house near Embassy Row in Washington, D.C. The price was $2.85 million. While those homes had mortgages, which would increase the amount of the Clintons' debt, the family also had equity in them. The New York Times reported that the Clintons put $855,000 down on the Washington house, for instance. That equity would have covered the low-end debt estimate of about $500,000. Point being: Clinton’s 2000 disclosure doesn’t prove the Clintons’ liabilities exceeded their assets when they left the White House. We reached out to Hillary Clinton’s office for more details and did not hear back. Were they dead broke? All this begs the question of whether someone who can afford to buy a $2.85 million house is "dead broke." We reached two accounting professors at Ohio State University’s Fisher College of Business, one of the top-ranked schools in the country. Assistant Professor Jeffrey Hoopes said to call the Clintons dead broke would be a stretch for how the term is commonly understood. "Almost any president leaving office can expect tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars of future earnings as a result of their having been president," Hoopes said. "Speaking, consulting, board positions, and so on, are all very lucrative." Professor Brian Mittendorf said a balance sheet of assets and liabilities simply doesn’t paint a complete picture. Mittendorf compared the Clintons to a medical school graduate saddled with huge debts but with the prospect of a very hefty income down the line. "While one can claim to be technically broke, creditors wouldn't take it as such as long as future income streams could cover the liabilities," Mittendorf said. In December 2000, at least one large bank saw the Clintons through that lens. Whatever their balance sheet might have been, Citibank lent them $1.995 million to buy that house in Washington, D.C. This was a safe loan. By Feb. 5, 2001, Bill Clinton was commanding regular speaking fees of $125,000 or more. Hillary Clinton herself did quite well in 2001. The book publisher Simon and Schuster paid her $2.84 million in royalties. By 2004, the Clintons had erased their debts and Hillary Clinton was ranked the 10th-wealthiest member of the Senate, with a net worth between $10 million and $50 million. Our ruling Hillary Clinton said she and Bill were in debt and dead broke when they left the White House. The public record shows that they possibly had more liabilities than assets, but it doesn’t show that conclusively. More important, a balance sheet does not tell the full story and the experts we reached said the Clintons’ earning potential had a real economic value that the financial sector traditionally acknowledges and is willing to bank on. A few weeks before they left the White House, the Clintons were able to muster a cash down payment of $855,000 and secure a $1.995 million mortgage. This hardly fits the common meaning of "dead broke." We rate the claim Mostly False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2014-06-10T18:18:14	2014-06-09	['White_House']
pomt-02282	Gov. McAuliffe's budget would "raid school, other $$ 4 Obamacare in VA."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2014/apr/06/republican-party-virginia/virginia-gop-says-mcauliffe-budget-would-raid-scho/	The Republican Party of Virginia says Gov. Terry McAuliffe is planning to help fund Medicaid expansion in Virginia by taking money from education and other state services. A March 26 tweet on the RPV website said, "@TerryMcAuliffe Not only did the GOP read your budget, we found the part where you were going to raid school, other $$ 4 Obamacare in VA.," We wondered whether the governor’s Medicaid plan really calls for such a diversion of funds. McAuliffe, a Democrat, has been urging the General Assembly to expand eligibility in the state’s Medicaid program to an additional 400,000 low-income and disabled Virginians. Under provisions of the Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare, the federal government would pay the entire expansion cost for the next three years and 90 percent of it down the road. The Republican-led House of Delegates has twice refused to broaden the program, saying the federal government can’t be trusted to pay its promised share. A stalemate between the House and the Democratic-controlled Senate is delaying passage of a two-year state budget. We asked Garren Shipley, the state GOP’s communications director, for evidence that McAuliffe plans to "raid" education and other services to pay for Obamacare. Shipley referred us to a paragraph in the thick budget plan released by the governor last month. On Page 516, it says, "The Director of the Department of Planning and Budget is hereby authorized to transfer appropriations among agencies and programs as needed so as to implement coverage for newly eligible individuals pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1396d(y)(1)[2010] of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act." That sequence of numbers, letters and parentheses in the paragraph refer to the section of U.S. law that spells out Uncle Sam’s obligations for paying most of long-term costs for Medicaid expansion. Shipley said the paragraph allows the administration to move money from any agency or department to fund Medicaid expansion. Shipley said if McAuliffe "intended" to do otherwise, the language would not be in his budget plan. But Brian Coy, a spokesman for McAuliffe, called the claim "an absurd allegation on its face." "That language is there for a very discrete purpose," he said. "It will allow the Department of Planning and Budget to distribute money that would come into the Commonwealth for closing the coverage gap for Medicaid expansion." If Virginia broadens eligibility, the new federal funds would flow into the Department of Medical Assistance Services, which runs the state’s Medicaid program. But to fully benefit from the expansion, DMAS would need to transfer some of the money to other state departments -- something is not empowered to do. Under expansion, for example, Medicaid would cover the treatment of inmates that needed to stay in non-prison hospitals for more than 24 hours. Funds would need to be shifted from DMAS to the Department of Correctional Services. The conduit for that transfer would be the Department of Planning and Budget. Expansion also would broaden Medicaid services for mental health and substance abuse. That would require money to be shifted from DMAS to the Department of Behavioral Health. Again, the Department of Planning and Budget would be the pipeline. Secretary of Finance Ric Brown said that because the transfer language sits in a section of the budget dealing with Medicaid expansion, the administration believes it applies only to those limited uses. But Brown added that wording of the provision could be improved. "The language could be tightened down," he said. "It could be tweaked to make sure it’s specific." We sought an opinion on the provision from retired state Sen. John Chichester, a former chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Chichester, a Republican who crossed party lines last fall and endorsed McAuliffe for governor, said the amendment would give the administration power to take money from other areas of the budget for Medicaid. But he questioned whether such a policy would be wise. Coy said such an effort would be unwise. He noted that the governor’s budget uses $225 million in expected savings from Medicaid expansion to fund pay raises for state employees and teachers, boost the Virginia Retirement System and increase benefits to workers who face hazardous duty. "The budget is taking the savings from Medicaid money and puts it into programs," Coy said. "We’re not going to then pull money from those programs into Medicaid." Our ruling The state Republican Party tweeted that within McAuliffe’s budget, "we found the part where you were going to raid school, other $$ 4 Obamacare in VA." McAuliffe invited some concern by submitting a budget amendment that can be interpreted as giving him authority to transfer money in and out of Medicaid from other state programs. The governor disputes that the provision gives him such power. In any case, "can" does not mean "will." The GOP goes overboard in saying McAuliffe is "going to raid" schools and other state programs to help pay for Medicaid expansion -- an endeavor that almost entirely would be supported by federal funds. The Republicans offer no proof that this is McAuliffe’s plan. In making the sensational claim, the GOP ignores that the governor has proposed using savings from Medicaid expansion to bolster other state programs, including education. So the GOP tweet has a grain of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give people a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-01602	"If black America were a country, it’d be the 15th wealthiest nation in the world."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/02/larry-elder/larry-elder-if-black-america-were-country-itd-be-1/	Conservative commentator Larry Elder and liberal CNN contributor Marc Lamont Hill got into a heated argument recently after while discussing the situation in Ferguson, Mo. Elder accused the media of exaggerating American racism for political ends. "As long as black people believe that race and racism are the major problem in America, you’ve got that 95 percent monolithic black vote without which the Democratic party cannot survive," Elder said. Elder used his father’s rise from janitor to small business owner as an example of what he called the "thriving black middle class." "This is what happens in America," Elder said. "If black America were a country, it would be the 15th wealthiest country in the world. For crying out loud, this is not our grandfather’s America, and we ought not act like it is." Fifteenth wealthiest, out of 196 countries, sounds impressive and worth checking out. Buying power of African-Americans Elder referred us to an annual report by Target Market News called "The Buying Power of Black America," which publishes the only estimate we could find of the total earned income of African-Americans. In 2011, the report he provided us, Target Market News put the income spent by African-Americans at $836 billion. Elder got his talking point by comparing that figure to the World Bank’s list of each country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which is the monetary value of all the finished goods and services produced. In 2011, "black America's" $836 billion would have put it in 16th, above Indonesia and below South Korea. (The Target Market News report is behind a paywall, so we can’t see precisely how they reached their figure. We asked if Target Market News would provide us a copy, but we didn't hear back.) Target Market News hasn’t published another estimate on African-American’s earned income since 2011, but a 2013 report by the Selig Center for Economic Growth pegs their contribution to the market at $1 trillion. That would also rank 16th -- above Indonesia and below Mexico. Case closed? Not really. Experts told us that there are two major problems with Elder’s methodology. Earned income vs. GDP First, earned income and GDP aren't quite the same thing. Comparing them isn’t fair, said NYU economics professor Gian Luca Clementi, "because GDP is a concept that applies to a jurisdiction, not a group of people living in a jurisdiction." GDP is "a measure of the total income produced in a country," Clementi said, and factors like government expenditure and private investment mean that buying power and GDP aren't comparable. Second, Clementi said, "a country's total GDP only gives a measure of the total income produced in the country. Anyone having the ambition of using GDP as a measure of average economic well-being, should start dividing by the number of residents." Clementi used China as an example to better explain. While China has the world's second-highest GDP, "its inhabitants are still a lot poorer than any Western country’s residents." We took Clementi's suggestion and divided the most recent estimate of black earned income, $1 trillion, by the Census Bureau estimate of 44.5 million African-Americans. That would create a per capita buying power of around $23,000 a year, which would translate to around 34th around the world on the International Monetary Fund’s list of countries by GDP per capita (between the Bahamas and Malta). But $23,000 doesn’t go as far in the United States as, say, in Lithuania. Economists multiply GDP per capita by a conversion factor called purchasing power parity to account for the different values of goods and services in different countries. If you apply these factors, the African-American population’s $23,000 a year ranks 44th (between Portugal and Lithuania). The United States as a whole, for comparison, ranks seventh. Our ruling Arguing that racism is "not a major problem," Elder said that "if black America were a country, it would be the 15th wealthiest in the world." Elder took an estimate of African-Americans' total earned income ($836 billion in 2011) and looked at how it compared to national GDPs (it was actually 16th). But comparing earned income for a group of people to national GDPs isn’t a sound methodology, experts told us. The comparison falls more off the rails when you look at things on a per capita basis. In that scenario, black America’s buying power would rank around 44th when compared to countries’ per capita GDPs. We rate his claim False. Correction: Elder said racism was not a "major" problem. An earlier version of this fact-check omitted the word major.	None	Larry Elder	None	None	None	2014-09-02T14:03:08	2014-08-20	['United_States']
pomt-15225	"A majority of the candidates on this stage have supported amnesty ... I have never supported amnesty."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/07/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-most-gop-candidates-have-supported-amnest/	Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has a more aggressive stance on illegal immigration than the majority of his 2016 primary competitors, Cruz said at a primetime Republican debate Aug. 6. "A majority of the candidates on this stage have supported amnesty," he said. "I have never supported amnesty, and I led the fight against Chuck Schumer’s gang of eight amnesty legislation in the Senate." (Schumer is U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.) Of the 10 candidates on the stage, how many of them have supported "amnesty" for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants currently in the United States? The tough part about this fact-check is that "amnesty" is a vague term; some consider amnesty to be anything less than deporting all illegal immigrants, while others think of amnesty as letting immigrants stay with no punishment or additional requirements. We asked Cruz’s campaign staff how he would define "amnesty," but they didn’t answer that question. Cruz himself has been adamantly opposed to a pathway to citizenship, but he’s been quiet on whether he would support some other legal status for illegal immigrants. We’ve previously found that in modern politics, the standard for amnesty is the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, supported and signed by President Ronald Reagan. The law allowed illegal immigrants to become legal permanent residents if they met certain standards, such as proving they had been in the country for several years and paying back taxes and a fine. After meeting other requirements, the legal permanent residents could apply for a green card and eventually make their way toward citizenship. The law was widely described as an amnesty program. We do know Cruz considered the 2013 bipartisan Senate immigration proposal to be a form of amnesty and opposed the bill. The failed bill was similar to the Reagan law in that immigrants had to meet certain requirements before gaining legal status that put them on a path to citizenship, though the requirements are more stringent than the previous law. So we’ll use that bill as a rough standard for evaluating the positions of those who shared the debate stage with Cruz. Three debaters have expressed outright support for the Gang of Eight bill, so called after the bipartisan group of eight senators who proposed it in 2013. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., by Cruz’s standards, has been a clear supporter of amnesty, as he was a member of the Gang of Eight. At the time, he said the bill was "not amnesty," and we rated that claim Half True because of the vague nature of the term "amnesty." Since then, Rubio has softened his support for a path to citizenship and emphasized border security, but he still supports passing immigration legislation. Fellow Floridian Jeb Bush, the former governor, said in March 2015 that he would put his support behind a Gang of Eight-style immigration bill that included a path to citizenship. Like Rubio, though, Bush insisted at the debate that his position is not amnesty, because his ideal plan requires illegal immigrants to meet certain requirements before gaining legal status. Recently, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee has avoided saying whether or not he would support a path to citizenship, though he has suggested he would not blanket deport all illegal immigrants. But in 2013, asked by Fox if he would side with Cruz or the Gang of Eight, Huckabee said he would choose the latter -- though he emphasized an eventual immigration bill had to emphasize border security. He has also previously endorsed a path to citizenship. We could find only one of the candidates at the Aug. 6 debate (other than Cruz) who said he did not support this bill specifically. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., did not support the Gang of Eight bill because he said it did not include strong enough provisions for ensuring less illegal immigration in the future. But in a March 2015 speech, Paul walked a fine line -- supporting a path to some sort of normative legal status, but he did not use the word "citizenship." For the remaining four candidates, we could not find their opinions on the Gang of Eight bill specifically, but all four have at some point supported a path to citizenship or legal status, even if their position has since changed. While Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker no longer supports a path to citizenship, he said in 2013 that "it makes sense" people could not only stay in the United States but get citizenship after overcoming penalties, waiting periods and other requirements. Neurosurgeon Ben Carson has declined to comment on the Gang of Eight bill. He has said that the solution for illegal immigrants currently in the United States is for them to go back to their home country, where they can apply for a visa and return legally. In Carson’s 2012 book, America the Beautiful, he said a path to citizenship is a moral choice. In 2010, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said he supported a "commonsense path to citizenship." But this year, he said he’s changed his mind and no longer supports such a path. Ohio Gov. John Kasich said in 2014 and 2015 that he isn’t keen on a path to citizenship, but he’s open to the possibility -- especially because you can’t deport everyone who is already here, and it would help get lawmakers to a point of compromise on immigration legislation. Despite his fiery rhetoric regarding Mexican immigrants, real estate mogul Donald Trump hasn’t said many specifics about what he’d do regarding the illegal immigrants already here. He has said this year that he would support a "merit-based" system for some illegal immigrants earning their right to stay, echoing comments he made in 2011. Many of these candidates have changed their position on what to do about the illegal immigrants already in the United States. But as far as we can tell, Cruz is the only one who has never plainly supported something like a path to citizenship or some other form of legal status. Six have expressed outright support for a path to citizenship at some point in their recent political careers. It is worth noting again, however, that the definition of "amnesty" isn’t hard and fast, so what Cruz may consider amnesty might not be what any of these candidates considers to be amnesty. Our ruling Cruz said at a Republican debate, "A majority of the candidates on this stage have supported amnesty," adding, "I have never supported amnesty." All of the candidates at the debate, with Cruz as the exception, have at some point in their recent political careers expressed support for a pathway to citizenship or other legal status for illegal immigrants currently in the United States, somewhat like was proposed in the Gang of Eight bill. Because there is no hard and fast definition for "amnesty," some would argue that this does not necessarily count. However, it is reminiscent of 1986 legislation that was widely considered amnesty. By Cruz’s standards, any path to citizenship is amnesty. We rate Cruz’s claim Mostly True.	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2015-08-07T17:10:35	2015-08-06	['None']
pomt-08835	McCain opposed the border fence.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/11/jd-hayworth/hayworth-claims-mccain-opposed-border-fence/	As the U.S. Senate race in Arizona heats up, the TV ads are getting more and more brutal. In its latest ad, J.D. Hayworth's campaign attacks Sen. John McCain for alleged opposition to constructing a fence on the U.S.-Mexico border. The ad begins with a narrator announcing that "McCain lies...again." Then, over the course of several slides, it says that "McCain wrote the Amnesty Bill ... opposed the border fence," and supported "Social Security and Medicare benefits for illegals." In this item, we'll be checking the claim that McCain opposed the border fence. The ad cites McCain's vote on an amendment to the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2007. Introduced by Sen. Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican, it would have provided an additional $1.8 billion to "construct double-layered fencing and vehicle barriers along the southwest border." It also called for offsetting increased funding for the fence "by reducing all other discretionary amounts on a prorata basis." We checked Senate voting records and found that McCain voted against the amendment. He was joined by several other Republican lawmakers, and the amendment was rejected. Still, it is a gross exaggeration to make the leap that voting "nay" on a single amendment translates into opposing the construction of a fence on the border. McCain voted for the final version of the bill signed into law by President George W. Bush on Oct. 4, 2006. "The bill I sign helps us address one of the central issues facing all states, but particularly a state like Arizona, and that's illegal immigration. I understand full well that illegal immigration puts pressure on the public schools and hospitals. It strains state and local budgets. In some communities, it increases crime. The administration and Congress have been taking decisive steps to address this issue," Bush said before signing the bill. According to the president's remarks, the legislation appropriated $1.2 billion for strengthening the border. More specifically, it provided funding for more border fencing, vehicle barriers, and "cutting-edge technology" such as ground-based radar, infrared cameras and advanced sensors. Even more telling, however, is what happened three weeks later. On Oct. 26, 2006, President Bush signed The Secure Fence Act of of 2006. This separate legislation, which had solid Republican support, authorized the construction of a 700-mile, double-layered fence on the U.S.-Mexico border. McCain not only voted for the bill, but the New York Times referred to him as one of the "Republican architects" of the legislation. That's hard to square with the anti-border enforcement candidate that Hayworth's ad describes. (We first learned about the New York Times article, along with a few other sources which we double-checked, from our friends over at FactCheck.org) Why did so many Republicans, including McCain, vote against an amendment to increase funding for the fence construction? According to Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., who also voted "nay" on the amendment, the extra funding would have been offset with cuts elsewhere in the bill, which would have meant not being able to hire 750 new border-patrol agents. Hayworth's ad claims that McCain opposed the border fence. As "proof," Hayworth cited McCain's vote on an amendment that would have provided increased funding for the construction of a double-layered fence on the U.S.-Mexico border. What the ad conveniently left out, however, is that McCain voted for the final bill, which provided $1.2 billion for strengthening the border. It also ignored McCain's key role in securing the passage of The Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized construction of a 700-mile fence on the border. Finally, it neglected to mention that the defeated amendment would have been paid for with cuts from other parts of the 2007 Homeland Security appropriations bill. Republican leaders -- who voted with McCain -- say that adopting the amendment would have resulted in cutbacks in hiring new border patrol agents. The ad is technically right that McCain voted against additional funding at one point. Still, we found that the claim is a gross exaggeration, so we rate it False.	None	J.D.

pomt-00400	Says he was sued by the NRA and the gun lobby "all because in my city we refused to repeal an ordinance which said you couldn’t shoot guns in city parks."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2018/sep/05/andrew-gillum/fact-checking-andrew-gillums-claim-he-was-sued-nra/	Speaking about recent mass shootings in Florida, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum called for the enforcement of "common sense gun laws" and touted his own fight against the National Rifle Association. "I was literally sued, drug through court for two years by the NRA and the gun lobby, all because in my city we refused to repeal an ordinance which said you couldn’t shoot guns in city parks," Gillum, Tallahassee’s mayor, said in an Aug. 29 interview on MSNBC’s The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell. Gillum is competing against Ron DeSantis, a pro-Trump Republican congressman, in the race to become Florida’s next governor. The election is Nov. 6. Gillum is right — he and other Tallahassee elected officials were sued because they did not repeal an ordinance prohibiting the discharge of firearms in public parks. But he left out some context. The NRA supported the lawsuit filed by gun rights advocates, but it was not a party to it. Courts allowed the ordinance to remain on the books, since a 1987 state law effectively declared it "null and void" and the ordinance wasn’t being enforced. Background on Tallahassee ordinances, lawsuit Two groups advocating for gun rights, Florida Carry, Inc. and the Second Amendment Foundation, filed a lawsuit in May 2014 against the city of Tallahassee, then-Mayor John Marks and several city commissioners, including Gillum, who served on the commission at the time. (He was sworn in as mayor November 2014.) The NRA did not sue. But it filed an amicus brief supporting Florida Carry and the Second Amendment Foundation. "Mayor Gillum knows the NRA is not suing him, but he also knows he wouldn’t get much attention by crying out that a small Florida group and another from Bellevue, Washington, have taken him to court," Marion P. Hammer, former NRA president wrote in an opinion piece published by the Tallahassee Democrat in January 2017. Second Amendment Foundation and Florida Carry said they were suing Tallahassee and its elected officials for "refusing to repeal ordinances restricting the use of firearms in defiance of Florida’s firearms preemption law." The lawsuit claimed that the ordinances (one from 1957 and another from 1984, amended in 1988) had been reprinted without being amended, and infringed on the Florida Legislature’s intent to provide uniform firearm laws across the state. A 1987 Florida law gave the state the exclusive power to regulate firearms and ammunition, and deemed "null and void" related local ordinances and regulations. The legislature in 2011 doubled down on the law by allowing penalties against local officials who enacted or enforced firearm regulations. The 1957 provision said, "No person shall discharge any firearms except in areas five acres or larger zoned for agricultural uses." The ordinance amended in 1988 made it "unlawful for any person to discharge a firearm in a park or recreational facility owned, managed, maintained, or controlled by the city," the lawsuit said. It added that Gillum and other commissioners in February 2014 voted in favor of indefinitely tabling a repeal discussion. The city of Tallahassee, in a filing to dismiss the lawsuit, argued that Florida Carry and the Second Amendment Foundation had "no clear legal right to compel" city commissioners to repeal the ordinances and that since the legislature had rendered the ordinances invalid, "nothing else is required." Nonetheless, the case moved forward. A circuit court judge, George S. Reynolds, III, ultimately sided with the city, saying that the city’s actions did not enact or cause the ordinances to be enforced. "While cleaning up the city code so that old city ordinances which are no longer legal, relevant, or enforced are removed may be good public policy, it remains the city’s prerogative – not the plaintiffs, nor this court’s," Reynolds wrote in his November 2015 opinion. The groups appealed to the Florida 1st District Court of Appeal. But the appeals court in February 2017 also ruled in favor of the city. While the ordinances "may still be ‘on the books,’ they are unenforceable and invalid," the court’s opinion said. Our ruling Gillum said that he was sued by the NRA and the gun lobby "all because in my city we refused to repeal an ordinance which said you couldn’t shoot guns in city parks." Gillum was among Tallahassee elected officials sued by two gun rights groups for not repealing a decades-old ordinance restricting the use of firearms in city parks. The local ordinance had been deemed null and void by a state law and not been enforced. The NRA supported the groups and filed an amicus brief, but it was not a formal party in the litigation. Other gun rights groups were the plaintiffs. Gillum’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-15215	Scott Walker "had a 2.3 GPA when he was asked to leave Marquette University for cheating."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/aug/11/facebook-posts/scott-walker-was-asked-leave-marquette-university-/	A reader asked us the other day to check a meme attack on Gov. Scott Walker that keeps making the rounds. She saw it on Facebook. The image in the meme, which apparently began circulating in early 2012, puts a dunce cap on Walker's head. It makes a reference to what would be the failed effort, later that year, to recall the Wisconsin Republican from office. Perhaps because Walker is now running for president, the meme has surfaced again. It said: "Walker had a 2.3 GPA when he was asked to leave Marquette University for cheating. Is it any wonder he’s attacking teachers now?" There is no indication on the meme itself of who produced it. Walker has denied being forced out of school. When we asked about the meme, his campaign responded by referring us to a brief comment he made Aug. 8, 2015 at the conservative RedState Gathering in Atlanta. Asked about lacking a college degree, Walker said: "It's simple. My senior year of college, I got a job offer from the American Red Cross. A lot of my friends who were a year or two older had degrees and no job. I had a job offer, no degree. I'm pretty smart. I took the job." As we'll see, Walker was a senior when he left for the Red Cross. And although Walker has refused requests to release his college transcripts, there isn't evidence to back the claims in the attack. College days examined Here's what we know about the governor's college days from a widely noted piece we published in December 2013: In February 1988, as a sophomore at Marquette, a Catholic university in Milwaukee, Walker entered a campaign for student government president. The day before the election, the student-produced Marquette Tribune endorsed Walker's opponent, liberal John Quigley, but said Walker was qualified. A controversy ensued. Students told the Quigley campaign they’d seen Walker workers and/or College Republicans emptying editions of the Tribune from racks in high-traffic buildings on campus. The newspaper responded with an election-day editorial headlined, "Walker unfit." It decried his "mudslinging" and said another factor in its reversal on Walker being qualified was the alleged theft of papers, which Walker’s camp denied. Quigley won handily. Administrators investigated. But we found no paper trail, and could not learn from interviews, what came of that investigation, if anything. For our December 2013 article and at Walker's request, Marquette issued a statement saying Walker "was a student at Marquette from fall of 1986 until spring 1990 and was a senior in good standing when he voluntarily withdrew." That meant that no conduct issues, academic or otherwise, blocked Walker from continuing in school at the time of his departure. The university also said Walker was in good standing each term while he was enrolled at Marquette as well as when he left, and that he "was not expelled or suspended from the university at any time." In February 1990, shortly before dropping out, Walker took a job in marketing and fundraising with the local chapter of the American Red Cross. It's also possible he was lured from school by politics. In fall 1990, while still living in the campus area, Walker ran against then-state Rep. Gwen Moore, a Democrat now in Congress, and lost. Two final notes: 1. In a separate item, also published in December 2013, we rated False a claim by the Wisconsin Democratic Party that Walker dropped out or was kicked out of college "not long after" he was "kicked out of student elections" at Marquette. After the original article was published, the Democratic Party removed the accusation from its website. 2. As for his grade point average, Walker’s gubernatorial campaign said in 2010 that he had a 2.59 (on a 4.0 scale), about three-tenths of one point higher than the meme claims. But we don't know for sure, because he has refused to release his transcripts. Indeed, when Walker said in February 2015 at the Conservative Political Action Conference that he had "unsealed" his college records, we rated his claim False. He had authorized Marquette to issue the statements we noted, but he has not released his transcripts. Our rating An Internet meme says Walker "had a 2.3 GPA when he was asked to leave Marquette University for cheating." Walker left school as a senior for a job with the Red Cross, but has not released his transcripts, which has left some to question the move. There is no evidence, however, to prove the grade point average, "was asked to leave" or the cheating parts of the claim. We rate it False.

pomt-04077	Says a recent study shows Florida students are second in the world in fourth grade reading, behind Singapore.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/jan/21/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-florida-fourth-graders-are-worlds-/	Florida Gov. Rick Scott wants to operate every facet of state government like a business. Monitor spending. Measure performance outcomes. Compare results to competitors. His vision for the state’s education system isn’t all that different. "I like measurement," Scott said during a Jan. 15, 2013, discussion with black lawmakers. "One positive, as you know: In the fourth grade reading, we're second to Singapore in the world, Florida students were. In math, we're above the international average. So there's some good things happening." His claim that Florida fourth graders are oh-so-close to being the world’s best readers piqued our interest. Right away, we found his source: results from the latest Progress in International Reading Literacy Study. The study is coordinated by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement and completed every five years since 2001. It examines reading achievement and habits of American fourth graders and their peers across the world. In 2011, fourth graders from 53 countries and subnational entities participated. That year, Florida used federal grant money to be evaluated independently of the United States -- the only U.S. "benchmarking" state for the PIRLS exam. Florida paid $1.9 million from a federal Race to the Top grant for this assessment and two other international studies, including the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) of fourth and eighth graders. The PIRLS results, released December 2012, surprised state officials. The average score of Florida fourth graders ranked No. 2, above the average for the United States. "Second in the world. To be able to use those words is ... wow," Mary Jane Tappen, a deputy chancellor at the Florida Department of Education, told the Orlando Sentinel. The gaps between reading scores for the highest achieving countries were not statistically significant. Florida’s score was just two points short of No. 1 Hong Kong -- not Singapore, as Scott said. Florida edged out Russia and Finland by one point, and Singapore by two points. Northern Ireland, the U.S., Croatia and Chinese Taipei were in the second highest tier of readers, followed by Ireland and England. That’s not the only way to look at the data. Florida did finish second behind Singapore in terms of the percentage of fourth-grade students scoring in the advanced reading level (24 percent vs. 22 percent). One measure isn’t exactly better than the other, said Martin West, associate professor at Harvard’s Graduate School of Education."These are just slightly different ways of cutting the data and the distribution of achievement in a given system," West said. The results vouch for Florida’s success in improving reading achievement in elementary grades, West said. In 1998, Florida fourth graders were well below the national reading average, but they were performing well above the national average by the late 2000s, he said. "They made considerable progress over the course of that decade," West said. "They’ve sort of held their level over the past couple of years." How important is the ranking? Chad Minnich, an editor at the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center at Boston College, warns against considering results based on rank. A more useful takeaway, he said, is to look at the increased number of countries who scored above the test’s high international benchmark, and that Florida did very well among those. Still, we wondered what would have been had other states been evaluated on their own. Florida’s education system has been getting a lot of accolades lately, but it’s still not in the upper echelon of states like Massachusetts, Maryland, Connecticut and New Jersey. Most people consider the annual National Assessment of Education Progress, dubbed "the nation’s report card," to be the best state-by-state measure of state education systems. The exam is given to a sample of fourth, eighth and 12th grade students every two years in reading and math. Florida students typically perform above average on the NAEP. States including Massachusetts, New Jersey, Connecticut and Maryland -- states with vaunted education systems -- are usually top dogs. "It’s certainly the case that based on this data from NAEP, we know that there are at least a handful of states that were they to participate, they would be likely to perform at higher levels than Florida," West said. Our ruling Scott said Florida students are second in the world in fourth grade reading, behind Singapore, and offers a study as evidence. The study backs his claim up, to a point. Florida students finished second in overall reading to Hong Kong, not Singapore. In the percentage of advanced readers, Florida ranked second behind Singapore. But it’s important to note these rankings do not account for every country in the world. Or every state in the United States. In fact, Florida was the only state included in the ranking Scott cited because Florida paid to be included. Scott would have been correct to say Florida finished second in the study, but he stretched the truth a bit when he said Florida ranked second in the world. It would have been more accurate to say Florida ranked second among 53 education systems that were included. We rate Scott’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-05551	Says under the Affordable Care Act, New Jersey’s "new (Medicaid) enrollees won’t qualify for the matching federal funds simply because we added them onto the rolls before 2014."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/apr/08/amy-handlin/affordable-care-act-withholds-federal-matching-fun/	Before being required by the national health care reform, New Jersey expanded Medicaid coverage to certain low-income parents, but according to one assemblywoman, the state is not getting any federal matching funds in return. Assemblywoman Amy Handlin (R-Monmouth) made that claim in an April 4 opinion piece published in the Times of Trenton, criticizing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act enacted in 2010. "The federal government is supposed to match what states spend on new enrollees," Handlin wrote. "I have serious concerns about Washington’s ability to keep a promise, especially because it has already indicated New Jersey’s new enrollees aren’t entitled to federal funds." Handlin later continued: "These new enrollees won’t qualify for the matching federal funds simply because we added them onto the rolls before 2014." The assemblywoman’s claim is largely inaccurate, because the state is still receiving federal matching funds for these parents. But when the reform’s expanded Medicaid eligibility takes effect in January 2014, New Jersey is slated to receive half of the matching rate awarded to some other states. In response to our findings, Handlin said in a statement: "The point is that we are taking a significant hit just for doing the right thing ahead of the federal mandate. The taxpayers in states that waited will get double the federal benefit." Here’s what PolitiFact New Jersey found: On a voluntary basis, New Jersey began providing Medicaid coverage for certain low-income parents in 2000 through its NJ FamilyCare program. Under health care reform, covering that population will be a requirement for all states. Starting in January 2014, states must provide coverage to adults under 65 years old with incomes below 133 percent of the federal poverty level. For instance, an individual with no children would qualify for Medicaid if the person earns less than $14,000 a year. New Jersey currently receives a federal matching rate of 65 percent for that parent population, but since the state began covering this population before enactment of the reform law, the federal match will drop to 50 percent in January 2014, according to state officials. States that did not previously cover parents will be eligible for a 100 percent match to support the expanded coverage -- double what New Jersey would be receiving, officials said. "New Jersey has been in the forefront on expansion of parent coverage and we believe states that were early adopters are being penalized by the Affordable Care Act (ACA)," according to an application submitted by the state in September to the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Jennifer Velez, commissioner of the state Department of Human Services, told the Assembly Budget Committee last week that federal officials had denied the state’s request to immediately increase the match to 75 percent, and to 85 percent in 2014. New Jersey officials are now awaiting an answer to their request for a 100 percent match starting in 2014, Velez said. "Once they said no to the 75-85, right, our ask again was, ‘Will you consider our current parents -- at 65 percent match -- will you consider them ‘newly eligible’ in 2014,’ which would be matched at 100 percent, which is what other states will get who haven’t covered their parents," Velez told the committee members. Federal officials said last month a final rule on matching funds "will follow as technical work with States on (Federal Medical Assistance Percentage) methodologies and income conversion continues." Our ruling In an opinion piece in the Times of Trenton, Handlin claimed that federal officials "already indicated New Jersey’s new enrollees aren’t entitled to federal funds" and that "new enrollees won’t qualify for the matching federal funds simply because we added them onto the rolls before 2014." But the issue is not over whether matching funds will be granted, but how much. New Jersey currently receives a 65 percent match for certain low-income parents covered by the NJ FamilyCare program. That match is slated to drop to 50 percent, representing half of the rate to go to some other states. We rate the statement Mostly False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-06561	Wisconsin's new state budget includes "a 15 percent increase for road construction and yet we’ve got local towns tearing up" paved roads and replacing them with gravel.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/oct/02/mike-mccabe/campaign-money-critic-mike-mccabe-says-cash-strapp/	Folks aren’t afraid to speak their mind at Fighting Bob Fest, an annual political gathering in Madison, Wis. The event is named for Robert LaFollette, a fighter of corporate power and political corruption who served as governor, congressman and U.S. senator from Wisconsin in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Among those who spoke at the festival on Sept. 17, 2011, was Mike McCabe, executive director of the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, which tracks money in state politics and advocates for campaign finance reform. The nonprofit Madison group is affiliated with left-leaning organizations such as public employee unions. During one portion of McCabe’s fiery, 22-minute speech, it wasn’t a question of whether he made a statement worth fact checking, but which one to look at. In rapid-fire approach, he likened campaign contributions to legalized bribery; called the state’s new voter photo ID law a "poll tax"; and branded as "protection money" campaign contributions from David Koch to the Republican Governors Association and from the RGA to GOP Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. McCabe also made a factual claim that was, if less explosive, still intriguing. The state’s 2011-2013 budget, he said, includes a "15 percent increase for road construction and yet we’ve got local towns tearing up pavement and putting down gravel because the money is steered to private contractors instead, not to the local road crews that work for the townships and for the county." Towns tearing up paved roads and turning them into gravel? McCabe’s statement -- which was picked up by the liberal Daily Kos, a national website that does political analysis -- includes two pieces, the increase and the shift to gravel roads: 15 percent highway increase McCabe cited a document produced by Walker’s office on his 2011-2013 budget proposal. It shows that Walker proposed increasing spending on state highways by $410.5 million, or 14.7 percent, "over base amounts." And he pointed out that state money spent on highways goes to private contractors as opposed to local governments. That figure, however, shows just one piece of a much larger pie. The full pie includes not only general tax money -- the "base amounts" -- but also cash the state borrows for highway improvements. Department of Transportation budget director Paul Hammer cited a different DOT document that was also provided to us by Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie. It shows the 2011-2013 budget spends $3.23 billion on highways. That is actually less than what was spent in the previous budget, under Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, which was $3.27 billion -- although that figure included $91 million in one-time federal stimulus funds. So, McCabe cited a figure that the Walker administration used to suggest it was increasing spending on highways. But the total highway spending isn’t a 15 percent increase, but actually a decrease, so McCabe’s first claim is wrong. Converting paved roads to gravel In telling his audience "we’ve got towns tearing up pavement and putting down gravel," McCabe waved a copy of the Sept. 8, 2011, edition of Isthmus, a weekly Madison newspaper. It carried an article about state budget cuts to villages in the Madison-area. McCabe cited a portion of the article about Rick Stadelman, executive director of the Wisconsin Towns Association, which said: "Stadelman says he knows of several townships with blacktop roads in need of repair that have opted to dig out the blacktop and go back to gravel." We asked Stadelman which towns were converting paved roads to gravel. Noting that 40 percent of Wisconsin’s 62,000 miles of town roads already are gravel, he said he has heard towns talking about doing such conversions, but could recall only one that had: Mukwa in Waupaca County in east-central Wisconsin. You can probably see where this road is leading. Jim Curns, Mukwa’s town chairman, told us the town did convert a quarter-mile section of one little-used road from blacktop to gravel. But not as a result of Walker’s budget. He said it was done three to five years ago -- while Doyle was governor -- because the town couldn’t afford to repave it. To see whether other communities are converting paved roads to gravel, we checked with Dan Thompson, executive director of the League of Wisconsin Municipalities, and John Reinemann, the Wisconsin Counties Association’s legislative director. Both said they heard of isolated cases in recent years in which towns converted small sections of roads to gravel, but saw no evidence of a trend and nothing related to the 2011-2013 state budget. We looked some more and found that the Town of Saukville in suburban Milwaukee and the Town of Verona in suburban Madison are considering converting paved roads to gravel. But they haven’t done any yet. On that score, Wisconsin appears different than some of its neighbors. The Wall Street Journal reported in July 2010 that paved roads were being torn up across rural America and "replaced with gravel or other rough surfaces as counties struggle with tight budgets and dwindling state and federal revenue." And in March 2011, the Minneapolis Star Tribune described how financial issues led Michigan to change more than 100 miles of paved road to gravel and that an estimated 120 miles of pavement have been ground up or left to crumble back to gravel in North Dakota. Larry Galehouse, director of Michigan State University’s National Center for Pavement Preservation, which advocates for maintaining highways in order to reduce the need for reconstruction, told us: "This trend has been happening in many states, but primarily on very low volume roads and streets." He had no examples of roads being converted to gravel in Wisconsin. Our conclusion McCabe claimed the state budget includes a "15 percent increase for road construction and yet we’ve got local towns tearing up pavement and putting down gravel because the money is steered to private contractors instead." McCabe relied on a budget proposal document that didn’t spell out the full amounts spent on highways. State spending on highways in the new budget is actually down slightly from the previous one. McCabe also relied on a statement by a towns association official who could cite only one example of a paved road being converted to gravel -- and that occurred years before Walker was elected governor. The other experts we consulted said there is no trend in communities tearing up pavement and putting gravel in its place. We rate McCabe’s statement False.

pomt-07525	A government shutdown "could disrupt ... veterans' benefits."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/06/debbie-stabenow/debbie-stabenow-says-government-shutdown-could-dis/	With a possible government shutdown looming, Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., is backing legislation that would make sure the paychecks for members of Congress stop along with everything else. Although similar measures have been proposed, so far congressional paychecks are still intact. We addressed this proposal more generally in a separate item. But for this item, we were more interested in checking one of the arguments Stabenow made as she argued for the bill’s passage. "Lawmakers need to be held accountable and should feel the impact of a government shutdown just like many other Americans will," Stabenow said in a March 1, 2011, news release. "A shutdown could disrupt Social Security checks, veterans' benefits, hold up exports and cost private sector jobs and will stop paychecks for hundreds of thousands of people. It's only fair that members of Congress' paychecks be stopped too." You can read our analysis of whether a shutdown would endanger Social Security checks in our rating of a statement by President Barack Obama here. In this item, we’ll look what could happen to veterans’ benefits. First, some background about the laws that govern shutdowns, from a recent briefing paper by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The Constitution (Article I, Sec. 9) says, "No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law." This is reinforced by the Antideficiency Act, which stems from an 1870 law and which has been revised significantly over the years. That act prohibits federal officials from spending money before an appropriations measure has been enacted, though exceptions exist for "emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property." The biggest risk for veterans benefit checks comes from the fact that employees of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs are paid through appropriated funds. So a shutdown could prevent those employees -- just like employees of the Social Security Administration -- from going to work. How many VA employees would be considered "essential" -- and thus would stay on the job during a shutdown -- and how many would not remains to be seen. Many VA employees are doctors and nurses at VA hospitals and are unlikely to be furloughed. This situation for benefits employees is not yet clear. As a practical matter, the department has a bit of a cushion. Veterans’ benefit checks go out at the beginning of every month, so if a shutdown starts April 8 -- as would happen if lawmakers cannot agree on a deal -- there wouldn’t be widespread problems for existing beneficiaries for a few weeks. However, if a new month dawned with the government still on hiatus, a new round of checks could indeed be delayed, depending on which employees are deemed "essential." "If it goes beyond the first of the next month, you may see disruptions there," said David Autry, a spokesman for Disabled American Veterans. Checks for veterans from the Defense Department would be subject to the same types of uncertainties as those sent by the VA. In the meantime, two other benefits-related activities could be curtailed by a shutdown, depending on staff availability. Answers to routine inquiries from veterans could be slowed or stopped entirely. And there might be no employees to handle new claims for benefits. During the last government shutdown in 1995, "more than 400,000 veterans saw their disability benefits and pension claims delayed," Senate Veterans Affairs Chairwoman Patty Murray, D-Wash., said, according to the Army Times. "Money that they were counting on didn’t come to them. Payment of GI Bill education checks were delayed for hundreds of thousands of our veterans. Telephone calls from our veterans to veterans’ benefits offices went unanswered. Mail from veterans to our VA offices wasn’t opened. It wasn’t answered." So where does this leave us? By saying that a government shutdown "could disrupt ... veterans' benefits," Stabenow phrased her statement cautiously, and, for the most part, accurately. A shutdown is not destined to disrupt checks to veterans, but it could -- either for new claims, or, if the shutdown drags on long enough, for existing beneficiaries. Stabenow could have added that a shorter shutdown in line with the duration of those in 1995, or a generous allocation of "essential" employees, could minimize or even eliminate the impact on veterans checks this year. But we think that’s a minor omission, given how carefully she couched her statement. On balance, we rate her comment True.	None	Debbie Stabenow	None	None	None	2011-04-06T17:26:56	2011-03-01	['None']
pomt-12196	Cher "is moving to Canada because of President Trump."	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/26/blog-posting/did-cher-move-canada-because-donald-trump/	Cher’s prolific use of Twitter to criticize President Donald Trump has prompted an obscure website to claim the singer is moving to Canada because of his policies. "BREAKING: A Hollywood Star Is Moving To Canada Because Of President Trump," said a headline for a story published July 14, 2017 on conservativearmy88.com. "Many Hollywood celebrities announced that they will move in another country if Donald Trump won the elections. Well, the elections were held 7 months ago and he won, but no celebrity kept the promise," the post said. (The presidential election was held more than seven months ago, Nov. 8, 2016). The article speculated on Cher’s relocation, even though the headline presented a more affirmative claim. "However, singer Cher may be the first to move to Canada because of the President. As Trump announced he wants to change the Obamacare, she took it to Twitter to express her anger," the post said. Several celebrities did say they would leave the United States, including to Canada, if Trump was elected. On her part, Cher joked she would move to another planet, Jupiter. In reply to a Twitter user, Cher wrote on June 16, 2015, the day Trump announced his candidacy: "IF HE WERE TO BE ELECTED,IM MOVING TO JUPITER 😖" We reached out to the singer via social media for comment but did not get a response. Cher’s website lists a series of upcoming performances in Las Vegas and Washington for the rest of the year. And while her Twitter feed features a series of tweets criticizing Trump and his policies, a search of the word "Canada" in her tweets did not yield any message saying she had moved up north. Cher also attended the Women’s March on Washington on Jan. 21. "I want to let people know that I'm here for them and I believe in this movement," Cher told the Los Angeles Times. It’s also worth noting that conservativearmy88.com’s website does not have any information identifying who runs it, its mission, where it’s based or other information that credible news organizations publish on their website. Its post don’t have author names and are all posted by a site administrator, "admin." Conservativearmy88.com’s Facebook page lists a Hotmail email address. We reached out but did not get a response. While several celebrities claimed they would move to Canada if Trump won the presidency, Cher joked she would to Jupiter. Cher’s still on planet Earth, but there’s no indication she’s in Canada.

pomt-04753	Says "taxes were raised 115 times in the eight years before I became governor" and those increases were part of a "path that led to wealth and jobs and people leaving our state."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/aug/28/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-keynote-address-taxes-new-je/	In the biggest speech of his political career, Gov. Chris Christie took a moment to repeat one of the favorite lines of New Jersey Republicans: The state raised taxes 115 times in the eight years before he took office, contributing to a loss of jobs, wealth and residents, the governor said Tuesday night during his keynote address at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla. "When I came into office, I could continue on the same path that led to wealth and jobs and people leaving our state or I could do the job people elected me to do – to do the big things," Christie said. The governor went on to say: "But we were on a path we could no longer afford to follow. Now they said it was impossible -- this is what they told me -- to cut taxes in a state where taxes were raised 115 times in the eight years before I became governor." Christie’s number is about right, but the governor should have said that figure includes increases in taxes, fees and other tax policy changes. Also, as we previously found, there are many factors behind losing jobs, wealth and residents. PolitiFact New Jersey found the same problems in October when we fact-checked a similar claim by State Senate Minority Leader Tom Kean Jr., who said Democrats chased away jobs by "raising taxes over 115 times" in the past 10 years. We confirmed that from 2002 to 2009, state officials approved roughly 115 increases in taxes and fees or other tax policy changes. Those tax hikes included increases in the cigarette tax, the sales tax and the gross income tax. Among the fee increases was a bill passed in 2008 to increase the maximum fees for permits to manufacture, store, sell or use explosives. But Christie also described those "taxes" as part of a "path that led to wealth and jobs and people leaving our state." As we determined for previous fact-checks, there are many factors leading to a loss of jobs, wealth and residents. For instance, experts have pointed to the general downturn in the economy as one of the contributing factors. Our ruling During his keynote address, Christie claimed "taxes were raised 115 times in the eight years before I became governor" and those increases were part of a "path that led to wealth and jobs and people leaving our state." But the governor shouldn’t have described all of those 115 increases as "taxes." In the eight years before he took office, state officials approved roughly 115 increases in taxes and fees or other tax policy changes. Also, there are multiple factors behind losing jobs, wealth and residents, such as the general downturn in the economy. We rate the statement Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-14461	In head-to-head polls for the general election, "I beat Hillary Clinton by more than anybody, by 11 points."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/03/john-kasich/john-kasich-correct-he-polls-best-against-among-go/	Early in the Republican presidential debate in Detroit, the candidates mixed it up over polling data. First, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said that "of all the people on this stage, (Donald Trump) performs the worst against Hillary Clinton" in head-to-head matchups for the general election. Ohio Gov. John Kasich later added that he’s the candidate best positioned to take on Clinton, the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. "I beat Hillary Clinton by more than anybody, by 11 points," Kasich said. He was referring to the four Republicans on the debate stage -- himself, Rubio, Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. Was Kasich correct? We turned to the polling averages at RealClearPolitics.com, a popular aggregator of comprehensive polling data. We’ll start by noting that polling experts typically urge caution when comparing head-to-head matchups for the general election this early in the campaign cycle. That said, we looked at the polling results a couple of different ways. One was the RealClearPolitics poll average, which averages the most recent polls. The other was the range of results since Feb. 1. Here’s a table summarizing the results: Democratic nominee, RCP average Republican nominee, RCP average Head-to-head leader and margin Strongest poll for Republican since Feb. 1 Weakest poll for Republican since Feb. 1 Hillary Clinton 40.3 percent John Kasich 47.7 percent Kasich +7.4 Kasich +11 Kasich +3 Hillary Clinton 43.5 percent Marco Rubio 48.5 percent Rubio +5.0 Rubio +7 Rubio +2 Hillary Clinton 45.0 percent Ted Cruz 46.5 percent Cruz +1.5 Cruz +3 Clinton +2 Hillary Clinton 45.4 percent Donald Trump 42.0 percent Clinton +3.4 Trump +2 Clinton +8 What does this tell us? First, it confirms Kasich’s assertion that he beats Clinton "by more than anybody" still in the race. The average of recent polls shows that Kasich’s edge over Clinton is 7.4 points, which is larger than the leads over Clinton being posted by Rubio, Cruz or Trump. (In fact, on average, Trump actually loses to Clinton by 3.4 points.) The one element of Kasich’s statement that isn’t entirely supported by the data is that he beats Clinton by 11 points. It’s true that in his strongest recent poll, Kasich defeated Clinton by 11 points -- it was a USA Today-Suffolk poll taken between Feb. 11 and Feb. 15. But emphasizing that one poll is a bit of cherry picking. It also tells us that Rubio was correct that Trump does the worst against Clinton, as he loses to her by an average 3.4 percentage points in recent polls. Our ruling Kasich said that in head-to-head polls for the general election, "I beat Hillary Clinton by more than anybody, by 11 points." The RealClearPolitics average of recent polls shows Kasich faring better against Clinton than Rubio, Cruz or Trump. But focusing on the 11-point margin in his best poll is a bit of cherry picking. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-06971	Says a quote at the top of the redesigned website for the Department of Justice comes from a socialist who wanted to impose global common law.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/14/chain-email/chain-e-mail-claims-quote-top-redesigned-departmen/	The latest socialist/communist plot to take over the world is insidiously (if innocuously) placed at the top of the Department of Justice's newly designed website. At least, that's what a writer for the American Spectator and a number of chain e-mails would have you believe. "What's black and white and 'red' all over? The Department of Justice's newly designed website. Gone are the standard red, white, and blue motifs, replaced by an all-black backdrop. And prominently placed on virtually every page of the site is a quote credited to a man who facilitated a greater role for socialists and communists at the U.N. and the global 'workers rights movement,' according to a July 16, 2010 column in the American Spectator, written by someone who goes under the pen name, the Washington Prowler. "...Most jarring is the quote that appears on virtually every page of the website. 'The common law is the will of mankind issuing from the life of the people,' which, some DOJ staff say, is tied to a man who ushered in the socialist and communist theories that now permeate the United Nations." The quote is lifted from an inscription on the side of the Department of Justice Building. According to the Spectator: Some attorneys believed the quote is pulled or adapted from the writing of Sir William Blackstone, the 18th Century British jurist, who wrote the Commentaries on the Laws of England, which influenced not only British law, but also the American constitutional and legal system. But other Department of Justice employees say the quote originates from British lawyer, C. Wilfred Jenks, who back in the late 1930s and after World War II was a leading figure in the 'international law' movement, which sought to impose a global, common law, and advocated for global workers rights. Jenks was a long-time member of the United Nation's International Labor Organization, and author of a number of globalist tracts, including a set of essays published back in 1958, entitled The Common Law of Mankind. Most telling: Jenks, as director of the ILO is credited with putting in place the first Soviet senior member of the UN organization, and also with creating an environment that allowed the ILO to give "observer status" to the Palestinian Liberation Organization, and to issue anti-Israeli statements, which precipitated efforts by the U.S. Congress to withdraw U.S. membership from the ILO. The U.S. actually did withdraw in the mid-1970s due to the organization's leftist leanings. "It was Jenks's efforts that helped make the ILO a tool of the socialist and communist movement," says one of the DOJ lawyers. So already we're dealing with speculation from some unnamed attorneys in the Department of Justice. But even with this flimsy evidence, the story grew wings among conservative bloggers on the web, and various versions of the claim circulated widely by chain e-mail. One of the chain e-mails we received repeats the quote now on the DOJ website, and then gets sarcastic: Catchy, huh? Just one tiny little (too small to be relevant obviously) point -- the quote is from C. Wilfred Jenks, who in the 1930's was a leading proponent of the "international law" movement, which had as its goal to impose a global common law and which backed 'global workers' rights.' Call it Marxism, call it Progressivism, call it Socialism -- under any of those names, it definitely makes the DOJ look corrupt in their new website with Marxist accessories to match. How very interesting that 'they' couldn't find a nice quote from one of our Founders. People, we have lost our Republic. This is an example of the slow, methodical misuse of power our current government is doing as they lead us to socialism, and destroying our republic as we have known it. As with most chain e-mails, it ends, "Please, pass this on to people on your e-mail list. ASAP!" The whole argument, of course, rests on the supposition that the quote came from a socialist leader. We bet you can see where this is headed, but we'll usher you through the unraveling. We first contacted the Department of Justice. Tracy J. Russo, a spokeswoman for the DOJ, confirmed the quote appears on the façade of the main Department of Justice building in Washington, D.C. "The building was completed in 1935, and this inscription is just one of many that circle the building’s exterior," Russo said via e-mail. "It does appear on the eastern side of building, overlooking 9th Street NW. The full quote is: 'The common law derives from the will of mankind, issuing from the life of the people, framed by mutual confidence, and sanctioned by the light of reason.'" The quote was a favorite of former Attorney General Janet Reno, who dropped it into numerous speeches. For example, in a 2001 speech, Reno said, "There is, on the wall of the 9th Street gate, a saying that I have come to rely on again and again. It says, 'The common law derives from the will of mankind, issuing from the life of the people, framed by mutual confidence, and sanctioned by the light of reason.' Unless the law issues from all of the people, some of the people will feel left out. They will come to feel alienated. They will be angry. And this will not be a cohesive democracy. If you don't care about that, they will feel left out, alienated, and they will not have the opportunities that others have to skills, to jobs, to opportunity. That will only hurt America." Russo said the quote was chosen for the website when it was redesigned in October 2009 because the main Justice building was used as inspiration for the website design. "We’ve heard various reports of its origin but have not found any definitive information regarding the source," Russo said. "We don't actually know its origin." So we reached out to the Library of Congress. And three weeks later, they got back to us ... and the socialist conspiracy theory came crashing down. It turns out, the quote did not come from C. Wilfred Jenks. Jennifer Gavin, a spokeswoman at the Library of Congress said she asked two reference librarians to research the issue and here's what they found: The inscription, "The common law is the will of mankind, issuing from the life of the people," is attributable to Hartley Burr Alexander, 1873-1939 - poet, philosopher, scholar, and architectural iconographer. The chief sculptor of the U.S. Department of Justice building (1932-1934), C. Paul Hennewein, retained Dr. Alexander, then chairman of the philosophy department at the University of Nebraska, to assist with a unifying theme for the sculpture and inscriptions for the new building. Dr. Alexander’s correspondence and photographs are archived in the Hartley Burr Alexander Projects Collection at Scripps College in Claremont, California, where he was invited to chair a professorship in philosophy. So was Hartley Burr Alexander some kind of Marxist? Nope. "He seemed to be something of a liberal, but not a communist," said Richard T. Hull, an emeritus professor at the University at Buffalo who wrote a brief biography of Alexander for the American Psychological Association. A native of Lincoln, Neb., Alexander was a writer, poet and professor of philosophy at the University of Nebraska and later at Scripps College in Claremont, Calif. According to Hull's biographical sketch, Alexander "was a famed lecturer and teacher. He wrote articles, editorials and poems for several newspapers. He wrote and presented a number of pageants and a light opera. In addition to his articles in philosophical journals, he did field work in the anthropology of the Native American, developing a special interest in the poetic and spiritual quality of Native American songs and rituals and the symbolism of Native American mythology." The Department of Justice Building isn't the only one inscribed with his words. According to Hull's research, Alexander -- who was president of the American Philosophical Association in 1918-1919 -- was commissioned to design the decorative scheme, and write inscriptions for the Nebraska State Capitol building, the Los Angeles Public Library, the Fidelity Mutual Life Insurance Building in Philadelphia and the Oregon State Capitol building. In other words, Alexander had a varied and illustrious career, none of which would suggest putting his words atop the DOJ website is any kind subliminal socialist message. This whole issue is much ado about nothing. The authors cooked up a conspiracy theory based on misinformation about who authored the quote on the DOJ website (and the side of the DOJ Building), and then they ran with it.

pomt-06355	Rhode Island Treasurer Gina Raimondo "raised the mortality rate from 65 to 87" and "used a 1994 annuity chart" to create the pension crisis.	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/nov/06/paul-valletta/rhode-island-union-official-paul-valletta-says-big/	Paul Valletta Jr., president of the Cranston firefighters union, caused a stir during a recent hearing on the proposed pension overhaul plan when he claimed that General Treasurer Gina Raimondo "cooked the books" to create Rhode Island’s pension crisis. Valletta, a lobbyist for the Rhode Island State Association of Fire Fighters and an opponent of Raimondo's proposed reforms, said the general treasurer did it two ways. The first was by scaling back the predicted expected rate of return on the state pension fund’s investments, dropping it from 8.25 percent per year to 7.5 percent. (State pension investments have earned 5.74 percent per year over the last 10 years; 1.52 percent per year during the past 5 years.) The second was by increasing the predicted life expectancy of people in the retirement system. Both changes automatically mean the state needs more money to pay for retirement benefits. In fact, state officials say taxpayers next year will have to contribute $615 million, nearly double this year’s payment, unless the pension system is changed. We don't predict stock market trends. Instead, we'll stick with the statements Valletta made about the life expectancy issue. Raimondo, Valletta said, "raised the mortality rate from 65 to 87." Eighty-seven is too high, he contended, because "if you look at the Social Security mortality rate for the State of Rhode Island . . . it's 78 years old. But when they changed that mortality rate by her actuary in that meeting, they used a 1994 annuity chart" instead of more recent and more accurate figures. His comments raise a host of questions. * Did the state retirement system assume that the life expectancy of state workers was age 65 before Raimondo came along? * Did she really raise that age by 22 years, to 87, when the federal government pegs the life expectancy at 78 for Rhode Islanders? * Did the state really use a two-decade old annuity chart to predict life expectancy? * Did Raimodo make these decisions on her own? We decided to investigate. First of all, Valletta is really talking about life expectancy, not mortality rate, which is the number of deaths over a period of time. We found Social Security data citing a life expectancy of 78.2 years for Rhode Islanders, but those numbers were from 2000. To get more recent statistics, we checked with the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, which compiles all kinds of federal data, including life expectancies by state. Its latest statistics, from 2007, list the life expectancy in Rhode Island as 79.3 years. That's still pretty close to the 78 years cited by Valletta. But that's the life expectancy for a child born in 2007. Actuaries need to have up-to-date forecasts for people with the same age profile as current and future retirees. (To show how it gets complicated, the 2007 Social Security life table shows that the typical 65-year-old male will live to age 82 but someone who is already 80 will, on average, live to age 88.) When we asked Raimondo's office about Valletta's allegations, we were directed to the latest actuarial experience study done for the state Employee's Retirement System of Rhode Island. The state retirement board used the study -- based on data through June 30, 2010 -- when it adjusted the life expectancies of workers and retirees in April 2011. The report from Gabriel Roeder Smith & Company says the actuaries started with a 1994 actuarial table, but the study also makes it clear that the table was only a starting point. The actuaries then adjusted life expectancies based on gender and job (women and retired teachers tend to live longer than the typical male state worker). The expectancies were further adjusted upward by 10 to 20 percent to insure that the pension fund has a cushion to cover costs, especially at a time when life expectancy is increasing. Then the estimates were compared with actual death rates to see whether further adjustments were needed. According to the latest report, especially a key chart on page 28, the initial adjustments weren't enough. For example, the state actuaries projected that the typical male teacher would live to age 84.8. That turned out to be very, very close to what was actually happening, based on the retirement system’s data. From 2000 to 2006, the actual life expectancy was 83.9 years and from 2004-2010 it was 1.2 years higher -- 85.1 years. The report recommended ratcheting up the life expectancy for that group to 85.7 years. You can see the actual numbers in this chart, calculated for those who retired at age 65.. Actual life expectancy Estimate life expectancy 2000-2006 2004-2010 Previous Newest Male state employee 81.4 83.0 82.1 83.2 Female state employee 85.2 86.2 86.3 86.6 Male teacher 83.9 85.1 84.8 85.7 Female teacher 86.5 87.6 87.7 88.4 Joseph P. Newton, the actuary for the retirement board, emphasized this in followup testimony before the joint Senate and House Finance Committees on Nov. 1. "When a baby is born, [he or she] will live [on average] 78 years. We don't care because we want to measure when people are receiving pension checks, and they [typically] start receiving pension checks at 65," he said. "When we say the life expectancy we're using is 87, it's for a 65 year old, somebody who has already made it from zero to 65. So now they're expected to live to 87." Newton said that, based on the April vote of the retirement board, the state is now using 2000 projections instead of a 1994 actuarial table. We asked Valletta about Newton’s figures. He said he stands by his statement and believes the state should be using the Social Security life expectancy. He said he understands how the state actuaries calculated their estimate "but I don't agree with it. . . . I don't buy these actuary reports. . . . Whatever numbers they need to get to, they can find a way to get to." Our ruling Union official Paul Valletta said General Treasurer Gina Raimondo created the pension crisis when she, in part, used an outdated annuity chart and "raised the mortality rate from 65 to 87" even though life expectancy (as calculated by Social Security) is actually 78. First, the life expectancy for state workers wasn't 65 when the vote to raise it was taken. It was 82 to 88 (depending on the group). Second, the board didn't bump the life expectancy up by 22 years. It increased it by 0.3 to 1.1 years, depending on the group, to provide a funding cushion in case life expectancies continue to go up. Finally, Raimondo didn’t make that decision on her own. She was one vote on the 15-member retirement board, which she chairs. (The board voted 9-6 last April to approve the new life expectancies and lower the expected rate of return on the pension fund’s investment. Only one of the seven public employee representatives voted in the majority.) Valletta's statement includes a grain of truth -- a 1994 actuarial table was previously used in the calculations and 78 years is close to the Social Security estimates for overall life expectancy for the entire state. But he has omitted crucial facts and chooses to disbelieve the actual data that leads to a very different conclusion. We rate his statement Mostly False. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-06072	Says President Barack Obama "is a socialist."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/08/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-barack-obama-socialist/	In our super-heated political discourse, explosive words get tossed around pretty easily these days. Hitler comparisons and terms like Nazi and socialist have become the currency of political attacks not just in the blogosphere but also by elected officials. Texas Gov. Rick Perry launched such an attack at a Republican presidential debate in New Hampshire on Jan. 8, 2012. Asked if he agreed with Sen. John McCain that President Barack Obama "is a patriot," Perry replied: "I make a very proud statement and, in fact ,that we have a president that's a socialist. I don't think our founding fathers wanted America to be a socialist country. So I disagree with that premise that somehow or another that President Obama reflects our founding fathers. He doesn't. He talks about having a more powerful, more centralized, more consuming and costly federal government. "I am a Tenth Amendment believing governor. I truly believe that we need a president that respects the Tenth Amendment, that pushes back to the states. Whether it's how to deliver education, how to deliver health care, how to do our environmental regulations. The states will considerably do a better job than a one-size-fits-all Washington, D.C. led by this president." This was not the first time Perry has used the term against Obama. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas trace the origins to at least June 2008 when Perry told a Republican group that a European plan for cutting global poverty was "the type of socialistic program that Obama wants to bring to America." More recently, Perry told Fox News last November that, "I think Barack Obama is a socialist." A similar claim has been made by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who wrote a book titled To Save America: Stopping Obama's Secular-Socialist Machine. We've addressed Republican charges of Democrats being socialists before. In 2008, we explored a claim by Sarah Palin based on Obama's conversation with Joe the Plumber (as Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher came to be known after that conversation) that Obama's tax policy was socialism (Pants on Fire). Last year, PolitiFact Oregon and other PolitiFact state sites checked a claim by bloggers that 70 House Democrats are socialists (Pants on Fire). Asked about his Obama-is-a-socialist claim in November, Perry said, "When you talk about printing money and spending government money, and trying to spend it out. That conversation he had with Joe the Plumber -- kind of redistribute the wealth -- the best I can tell, that's socialism." But as we explained in our examination of Palin and Joe the Plumber's statements, Obama's tax policy relies on the same progressive approach that has been the cornerstone of American tax policy since the federal government first collected an income tax in 1863, an approach embraced by Republicans and Democrats. It was based on the Tax Act of 1862, which President Abraham Lincoln signed, and which imposed a "duty of three per centum" on all income over $600, and five percent on income over $10,000. The idea is that the wealthy pay a larger share of their income because they are more able to afford it. To the extent the government then gives some of the money to the less-wealthy through various programs, you could say the income is being redistributed. But that concept has been embraced by Republicans and Democrats for well over a century. That's a far cry from true socialism, which is defined as support for "governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods." That's enough for us to set the Truth-O-Meter ablaze, but let's dig a little deeper to explore whether Obama's main policies can accurately be called socialism. * The health care law. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has called the Democratic health care law "job-killing," a claim we rated False. Is it possible it's also socialism? (If it is, we should note that anything that kills jobs isn't very good socialism!) In fact, the health care law relies largely on the free enterprise system, an economic approach that Perry usually speaks about fondly. To increase health care coverage for the uninsured and people in small business, the law sets up exchanges to encourage private health insurance companies to compete. (In 2010, we chose the Republican claim that the law was a "government takeover" as our Lie of the Year.) * The economic stimulus. In February 2009, Obama and the Democrats muscled through the $787 billion spending package to try to jump-start the economy. The program was about one-third tax cuts and two-thirds government spending on everything from clean energy initiatives to electronic speed-limit signs. It's true that government payrolls were stabilized or grew because of the new money, but it was nowhere near a government takeover of our private enterprise economy. * The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). When Obama took office, he inherited the TARP, the Bush administration's plan for stabilizing the economy. It was designed to prevent financial firms from collapsing by buying assets and stakes in the companies. In December 2008, President George W. Bush authorized use of the money for loans to U.S. automakers. Obama has emphasized he was not eager for the U.S. government to be involved in such efforts but that he felt they were necessary. "If there's one thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans, and everybody in between, it's that we all hated the bank bailout," he said in his 2010 State of the Union Address, adding that "if we had allowed the meltdown of the financial system, unemployment might be double what it is today. More businesses would certainly have closed. More homes would have surely been lost. So I supported the last administration's efforts to create the financial rescue program. And when we took that program over, we made it more transparent and more accountable. And as a result, the markets are now stabilized, and we've recovered most of the money we spent on the banks." Many Republicans opposed the TARP -- an initiative of a Republican administration -- because they felt it was too much government intrusion into the private enterprise system. This is the one area where you could even begin to make a case that the government was taking ownership, but as a percentage of the full U.S. economy, it was relatively small and temporary. So add them up, and it amounts to flimsy evidence to even begin to argue that the Obama is on a path toward socialism. "Socialism means public ownership of the means of production. Obama does not believe this. Therefore he is not a socialist," conservative economist Bruce Bartlett told PolitiFact in an e-mail. "Although it is true that the federal government did come to own some private businesses as a consequence of bailout policies initiated by the George W. Bush administration such as TARP, the Obama administration sold many of them -- such as its shares in GM -- as quickly as feasible. A true socialist would have held on to them." Dan Mitchell, a scholar on fiscal policy at the libertarian Cato Institute, says there are other words for Obama's expansion of government (he thinks fascism is a fair term), but that it's not accurate to call it socialism. Daniel N. Shaviro, professor of taxation at New York University Law School, said "it is a lie" to say Obama is a socialist. "If he is a socialist, so were Eisenhower and Bush Sr." Our ruling There are plenty of ways to have a meaningful, substantive conversation about the differences of the Republicans and Democrats in tax policy, economics and the role of government. But it's simply preposterous for Perry -- and Gingrich -- to refer to Obama's policies as socialism or to say he is a socialist. Obama's policies may have expanded government, but they don't justify this ridiculous hyperbole. We're reaching for the matches -- Pants on Fire!

pomt-07420	"Mickey Mouse was registered to vote (in Florida)."	false	/florida/statements/2011/apr/26/eric-eisnaugle/mickey-mouse-was-registered-vote-florida-republica/	A bill that would make major changes to state election law passed the Florida House 79-37 on April 21, 2011, but not before Republicans and Democrats argued over the intent of the 157-page bill. Democrats say the bill is an attempt to suppress the votes of minorities, women and young people -- in part because the bill eliminates a four-decades-old provision that allows voters who have moved or changed their last name to update their information at the polls on Election Day. Those voters would have to file provisional ballots that are reviewed after the election under the proposed law. Another sticking point with Democrats is that the bill requires third-party groups like the League of Women Voters to register with the state and to turn in signed voter registration forms within 48 hours instead of the current 10 days. But Republicans say the changes are to protect the state against possible voter fraud. "This is a great country. Our vote is precious, and we're going to protect it," said Rep. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala, sponsor of the bill, HB 1355. During the floor debate, Rep. Eric Eisnaugle, R-Orlando, more directly rebuffed the suggestion from Democrats that the legislation isn't needed and noted several instances of fraud. (You can watch Eisnaugle's comments by clicking here. He starts speaking about two hours and 28 minutes in.) "One of my colleagues suggested that we spent hours of time on a problem that doesn't exist, also suggesting that nothing in this bill helps people vote," he said. "Well, members, it doesn't take much to find the documentation of fraud that some third-party registration organizations have committed right here in Florida. Just go on Google, and go to the news section and you can find a pretty long list of articles documenting the fraud we have seen. We have seen allegations of fraud, (Florida Department of Law Enforcement) investigations. (We have seen) falsifying of hundreds of registrations, including the registration of an actor who was already deceased at the time. In another case, Mickey Mouse was registered to vote. "In yet another case, hundreds or thousands ... of students were registered to vote without their knowledge after they simply signed a petition, having no idea that their information was then going to be turned around and used to register their names on the voter rolls here in Florida. "If we don't take action to put an end to the fraud, our vote doesn't matter as much," Eisnaugle said. Eisnaugle made three different fraud claims, and we plan to touch on each in this fact check to see if they're true. But for the sake of the Truth-O-Meter, we're going to home in on the line that stuck out because of the absurdity of it, if true: "Mickey Mouse was registered to vote." Registered dead actor Eisnaugle said one case of fraud included the falsifying of hundreds of voter registrations, and the registration of an already dead actor. This story comes from South Florida before the 2008 presidential election and involves the now-defunct Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now -- or ACORN. Eleven people hired by ACORN to register potential voters near Homestead were accused of falsifying hundreds of voter registration applications. In this instance, it was ACORN who turned in the hired workers. ACORN officials noticed the discrepancies in the cards turned in by the suspects and contacted authorities. The group workers turned in 1,400 cards, of which 888 were found to be fraudulent. Included among the fraudulent voter applications -- deceased actor Paul Newman. Workers also filled out a voter application for singer James Taylor or filled out several cards for the same real voter, the Miami Herald reported after the fraud was made public on Sept. 9, 2009. Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle praised ACORN for assisting authorities, and told Fox News that no one voted in the election using the fraudulent voter applications. "We've been very aggressive about a lot of these cases," Fernandez Rundle said. "But we would not have known about these workers unless ACORN brought it to us. "It's really minor, ineffectual attempts (by the hired workers) to justify getting paid an hourly basis. It could not have impacted the voting process whatsoever. Nonetheless, we cannot turn a blind eye to this.'' Students duped The story of the students thinking they were signing petitions -- only instead to be registered to vote -- comes from the 2004 presidential election. In October 2004, the St. Petersburg Times published a story talking about instances on campuses across the state where students were unwittingly either being registered to vote, or were being signed up to vote as Republicans when they wanted to be registered as something else. The Times quoted officials at the Florida Department of Law Enforcement who said that 4,000 students may have fallen for the trick. The likely suspect, the Times reported, was a group hired by the National Republican Committee to register voters. The workers would have the students sign a petition to legalize marijuana or a petition urging stiffer sentences for child abusers. Then, workers would have students unknowingly fill out a second form registering them to vote as Republicans. Mindy Tucker Fletcher, a senior adviser to the Florida GOP, told the Times that it doesn't help the party to register Democrats as Republicans if they didn't then vote to re-elect George W. Bush. In 2008, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement also investigated the stories of two Orlando-area teens who received voter registration cards in the mail even though they were too young to vote. The girls said they filled out entry forms to win a riding lawn mower while at the mall, and that they think someone used their information to forge or create voter applications. The voter applications were stamped with ACORN symbols. Mickey Mouse Then there's Mickey Mouse, the cartoon face of the Disney empire, and apparently a Florida registered voter. (Take that, California!) It turns out Mickey did fill out a voter registration application in Orange County ahead of the 2008 presidential election. Mickey checked the box indicating that he was updating his voter registration information and was changing his name. According to the application, Mickey appears to have listed a birth date of Jan. 15, 2002, the address of "15 Ave 17 0922" in Orlando, and a zip code, 56812, that isn't on file with the United States Postal Service. The phone number -- with a 407 area code -- was disconnected when we called on April 22. Mickey's Social Security number started 123. Orange County elections officials rejected his application, which was stamped with ACORN's label. So Mickey was never officially registered to vote. ACORN officials told the St. Petersburg Times, in a story published in October 2008, that the group scanned suspicious applications and that they believe the Mickey Mouse application did not come from them. Florida law requires third-party groups like the now-defunct ACORN or the League of Women Voters to turn in every application to elections supervisors. The purpose is to prohibit a group from not turning in registrations it may not like because of a voter's party choice. Our ruling What's worth noting is that, in all three stories Eisnaugle cited, the fraud was exposed. The only real impact was that students in 2004 were registered as Republicans when they wanted to be registered as something else. It's also worth noting that it's unclear how HB 1355 -- had it been part of election law -- would have altered any of the above three scenarios. Here's what Lyndsey Cruley, a spokeswoman for House Republicans, told us in response to our efforts to contact Eisnaugle. "If you listen to Rep. Eisnaugle’s remarks in full, it is clear that his entire speech was directed only toward the actions of some third-party registration organizations," she said. "Rep. Eisnaugle cited accurate information that such a third-party registration organization fraudulently submitted a registration for Mickey Mouse. In doing so, he intended to illustrate the need for provisions included in HB 1355 that would identify and prevent potential voter fraud from illegal voter registrations by third-party registration organizations. "Currently, there is no mechanism to identify which groups or person is responsible for submitting fraudulent registration forms and this measure would correct that, adding an additional layer of accountability to our state’s elections process. In sum, although Rep. Eisnaugle’s remarks could be interpreted, if taken out of context, in two different ways, he clearly intended to demonstrate that some third-party registration organizations have committed fraudulent actions here in Florida." Cruley is right that the bill would require third-party groups like the League of Women Voters to identify voter registrations they submitted. But we're checking Eisnaugle's claim made on the House floor that Mickey Mouse was registered to vote. Mickey never got that far. Someone filled out an application for him, but the application included so many inaccuracies that -- even if mice were allowed to vote in Florida -- Disney's animated superstar would have had problems. To us, the application looks more like a dumb prank than attempted voter fraud. And it was rightly rejected by the elections supervisor. We rate this claim False.

pomt-15120	Says Scott Walker said "Labor unions don’t deserve to have a national holiday" due to their damage to the economy. And the holiday "should be replaced by Patriots Day, celebrated every year on 9/11."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2015/sep/10/facebook-posts/facebook-post-says-scott-walker-wants-end-labor-da/	We’re marking two special days this week -- Labor Day and Patriot Day, the official name given to the day of mourning that marks the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The two days -- and Republican presidential contender Scott Walker -- converged in a meme going around Facebook that one of our readers saw and asked us to check out. In it, a picture of Walker is accompanied by this quote: "Labor Unions don’t deserve to have a national holiday. They’ve done more damage to our economy than any recession ever did. Labor Day should be replaced by Patriots Day, celebrated every year on 9/11." The meme indicates Walker said this on Sept. 5, 2015. Only he didn’t. To be sure, Walker is no fan of organized labor, but there is no evidence he made such a statement. To the contrary, a closer look shows the meme was created by a group that mocks conservatives called "Stop the World, the Teabaggers Want Off." Dig even deeper and you find a disclaimer that says the site is meant to be satire. They’re old pros at creating this kind of stuff -- and having readers unwittingly pass it around as if it is the truth. This Walker-focused meme has been shared some 2,800 times on Facebook. The "Stop the World" site is not new to PolitiFact readers. Our partners in other states have reviewed other fake statements involving GOP presidential contenders. Marco Rubio: PolitiFact Florida looked at a quote attributed to U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida: "No, felons should not have their voting rights restored even after they have served their sentence." There was no evidence that Rubio had actually said the words attributed to him, although he has been critical about felons regaining voting rights. The claim was rated False. Ted Cruz: PolitiFact Texas looked at a meme that claimed U.S. Ted Cruz said this: "While there may have been an age difference, Josh Duggar’s transgressions are far less an affront to God than what gays do to each other." Duggar, a reality TV star, resigned from the conservative Family Research Council after reports that he had sexually assaulted several girls, including two of his sisters, when he was 14. PolitiFact Texas rated the claim that Cruz had made the comment Pants on Fire. The myth-busting site Snopes has looked at a number of other outlandish fake quotes attributed to conservatives, including Sarah Palin, "Duck Dynasty" star Phil Robertson and former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney. All were made up. (Snopes has declared the Walker meme false.) Indeed, the group got more than the alleged Walker quote wrong. It also mixed up Patriot’s Day (April 19), which marks the first battles of the Revolutionary War, with Patriot Day, which is Sept. 11 -- the day of the terrorist attacks on the United States. Our rating A Facebook meme attributed a fake quote to Gov. Scott Walker saying Labor Day should be replaced by Patriots Day. Walker never said such a thing, and this site has a track record of falsely attributing statements to conservatives. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-00824	Under current conditions, by 2023, the interest payments on the national debt will be $722 billion, larger than the projected defense spending of $696 billion.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/mar/27/tom-price/prices-budget-point-about-rising-deficits-money/	It’s budget time in the nation’s capital. And, as the GOP produces its first spending proposals since President Barack Obama took office, a metro Atlanta voice is central to the discussion. U.S. Rep. Tom Price, R-Roswell unveiled his 2016 budget resolution as House budget chair last week. It would reduce spending by $5.5 trillion in the next 10 years in a bid to produce a budget surplus by 2025. The House on Thursday narrowly approved a budget that follows much of Price’s blueprint but also adds $38 billion in war funding. The original plan, though, made it clear that even with attention to military spending, the focus would be spending cuts. "Under current conditions, by 2023, interest payments on the nation’s debt alone will be $722 billion," Price wrote in the budget blueprint. "That will be larger than (Congressional Budget Office’s) projected defense spending budget of $696 billion." Most budget watchers have played down those claims, since fiscal conservatives and defense hawks have just worked to pass a budget that opens up Senate negotiations over a so-called reconciliation package that can go after Obamacare. But is the Price blueprint right? Without spending reductions, will taxpayers be paying more to carry debt than to have a standing military? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check it out. Price cites the Congressional Budget Office for his projections. The CBO is a federal, nonpartisan agency that has provided Congress with budget and economic information since its creation in 1974. The agency publishes projections several times a year, based on its detailed formulas that look at current laws, historic spending, revenue trends and other previous projections. The figures that Price cites are in the January budget and economic outlook for 2015 to 2025. Based on information from December 2014, the report estimates that the nation’s debt will be about 2.6 percent of the Gross Domestic Product for the year. That’s the smallest deficit relative to the nation’s economic output since 2007 but just under the 50-year historical average of 2.7 percent of GDP. And, tucked into the tables that help examine the rising deficits are the exact numbers that Price cites. On page 13, a table of the agency’s budget projections shows an estimated $722 billion bill for 2023. Deeper into the report, on page 86, the report projects defense spending will total $696 billion. So is it settled? Not quite. First, it’s important to recognize that defense total is a projection based on the spending caps, or sequestration, in effect through 2021. Those cuts are what some of the additional funding restored in the House budget version approved this week. Looking at the CBO projections without the automatic spending reductions, defense spending in 2023 is forecast to be $752 billion – substantially ahead of the projected price tag on the nation’s debt. Then again, that is a short-lived balance. By 2024, even stopping sequestration on defense spending, the CBO projects $777 billion in interest payments and $771 billion on defense. Price has a point when raising concerns about the projected cost of our national debt. And using the CBO projections gives a broad credibility, given the agency’s reputation for high-level, nonpartisan analysis. But there are caveats, said Laura Wheeler, a senior research associate at the Center for State and Local Finance at Georgia State University. After all, the projections are not hard and fast expectations but highly refined estimates on known factors at a snapshot in time. When the January report was released, for instance, the calculations could not account for recent financial woes in Europe, which undoubtedly affect the U.S. economy, or the possibility that American troops could be sent abroad, Wheeler said. "Based on what we know is going to happen and what has already occurred by trend, this is what the future looks like," she said. "There is a lot that can change, especially in 10 years." The question then becomes whether defense spending is the yardstick to measure the nation’s rising deficits. That becomes a political discussion, with some favoring military spending as the benchmark and others looking instead at costs such as medical spending. Wheeler, an economist, said many outside analysts prefer to examine the debt level compared with the GDP. As the CBO report points out, the 2014 rate is expected to be just a tenth of a percentage point below the historic rate of 2.7 percent. By 2025, the CBO projects a steep increase, 4 percent of GDP. That goes back to Price’s point, that interest on our national borrowing is projected to grow faster than the economy. That could change, especially if the sluggish economic recovery ramps up. But the projected increases are enough to get people – read political leaders – concerned, Wheeler said. "This becomes a philosophical debate about how to best handle that concern and when it becomes a problem," Wheeler said. "This is a place to start that conversation." A big part of Price’s job, for Georgians and all Americans, is to frame that conversation. His first budget proposal claims without change, the nation will be paying more in interest on our debt than our military. His figures are based on the best-available data, which tries to project a decade out. Those projections can and will change, though how is impossible to know. The decision to compare military spending with debt is not a common way to benchmark projections. But even the broader comparisons Price could have made – about the share of the nation’s economic output being spent on interest payments – support that broader argument. We rate his claim True.

pomt-01725	"The per-pupil cost in the [Blackstone Valley Prep] Mayoral Academy far outweighs the per-pupil cost in Cumberland public schools."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2014/aug/07/ralph-mollis/ralph-mollis-says-pupil-costs-blackstone-valley-pr/	Charter schools have stirred national and local debate since the first ones opened in the 1990s. Supporters claim they provide greater options and promote higher achievement. Opponents claim many charters don’t measure up to those promised achievements, and strain municipal budgets. The issue arose during a July 10, 2014, "State of the State Debate" between two of the three Democratic candidates for lieutenant governor: Secretary of State A. Ralph Mollis and Cumberland Mayor Daniel J. McKee. (State Rep. Frank Ferri, also a candidate, did not participate.) The focus: The Blackstone Valley Prep Mayoral Academy. McKee is the current chairman of the academy’s board. Mollis, a charter school skeptic, focused on costs, saying, "The per-pupil cost at the mayoral academy far outweighs the per-pupil costs in Cumberland public schools." Mollis continued: "One of the major issues right now is what’s happening in public education -- that we’re not providing enough funds and resources into our public education system, that entities like the mayoral academies are taking money from our public school system …" Some background: Charter schools are independently run public schools that are granted greater flexibility in their operations, in return for greater accountability for performance. Mayoral academies are regional charter schools whose boards are chaired by a mayor. Blackstone Valley Prep was started in 2009 as "an intentionally diverse" network of tuition-free public schools. Chartered by the Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE), Blackstone Valley Prep enrolls students from Central Falls, Cumberland, Lincoln and Pawtucket: There are currently some 1,000 students in grades K-8. A high school is set to open in the fall with 100 ninth-grade students. We started our fact-checking by looking at RIDE statistics. RIDE reports per-pupil costs for all public schools in the state by adding up total budgets and dividing by the number of students. It uses a "Uniform Chart of Accounts," a standardized method by which every district, public charter school and state-operated school tracks revenue and expenses the same way. RIDE says that allows "for an apples-to-apples comparison between districts." Contrary to what Mollis said, RIDE’s figures show that Blackstone Valley’s per-pupil costs were actually LESS than Cumberland’s in fiscal years 2012 and 2013. However, in fiscal years 2010 and 2011, -- the charter’s first two years -- Blackstone Valley’s costs were significantly higher. (The fiscal year runs from July 1 through June 30.) Here are the numbers: FY 2010: Cumberland $11,007. Blackstone Valley Prep: $15,664. FY 2011: Cumberland $10,905. Blackstone Valley Prep: $15,408. FY 2012: Cumberland: $12,294. Blackstone Valley Prep: $11,716. FY 2013: Cumberland: $12,280. Blackstone Valley Prep: $12,054. RIDE spokesman Elliot Krieger said the costs are "equalized," by subtracting capital costs and debt service from those who report it through the school budget - "the only fair way to compare districts." Krieger says, "Our pupil expenditure data does not support that [Mollis’] statement." That seems pretty straightforward, right? But when we asked the Mollis campaign to back up his statement, campaign manager Nicholas Cicchitelli directed us to RIDE "revenue-per-pupil" figures - not cost-per-pupil - as "black-and-white support" for Mollis’ claim. Cicchitelli said that’s a more valid figure to use because it "shows how much money taxpayers are actually paying per pupil to the Mayoral Academy vs. what they pay to Cumberland public schools per pupil." But hang on a minute. First, in the debate, Mollis said "cost per pupil," not "revenue per pupil." And second, revenues are actually "money coming in," versus expenditures - which is money spent. The revenue is from all sources - local, state, federal, and ‘other,’ such as grants and donations, says Krieger.(In May, for example, BV Prep received a $450,000 grant from Next Generation Learning Challenges to launch its high school this fall). Cicchitelli also said that Mollis did not use the term "per pupil expenditure" because RIDE "includes some things and excludes others which distorts the true cost. For example, debt service is manipulated … " Seeking clarity, we contacted the Cumberland School District. Alexander Prignano, district business manager, offered this view: "The latest RIDE numbers are right," he said. "They do show BV and maybe two others are lower [than Cumberland.] But to say that without looking behind the numbers is misleading." Prignano said per-pupil costs at charter schools are typically lower "because they don’t have the special ed population that a public school will have, and special ed students are very, very costly to educate." Another example: mayoral academies are exempt from the state’s pension system, he said. We asked Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council - an independent, nonprofit and nonpartisan public policy research and education organization - to weigh in. Executive director John C. Simmons said RIDE provided RIPEC with data for per-pupil expenditures and per-pupil revenue, "which allowed us to compare the two schools over time." "We would say you should look at the cost per student as opposed to where the money came from," Simmons said. He noted, for example, "You can get grants and contributions that are not taxpayer money." Simmons also said it’s not surprising that Blackstone Valley’s costs per pupil in its first few years were high because of the expense of starting a new school, spread out among relatively few students -- 76 in the beginning. And it’s not surprising that those costs "would decline rapidly as the number of students increases." Simmons said, "It looks like during the first two years of transition, Blackstone spent a considerable amount more [per pupil] than Cumberland did. When you look into the more norming years, Blackstone Valley spent less than Cumberland by a couple hundred dollars." Our ruling Ralph Mollis said: "The per-pupil cost in the Mayoral Academy [Blackstone Valley] far outweighs the per-pupil cost in Cumberland public schools." That’s a pretty sweeping claim. And it’s only true for the school’s first two years, when start-up costs, spread over a relatively small number of students, would be high. It’s not true for the more representative last two years, when the Academy’s per-pupil costs were lower, not higher. The efforts of the Mollis campaign to consider "revenue per pupil" didn’t sway us. It’s not the same thing and it’s not what Mollis said. Because Mollis’ statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-08989	Says Texas has one state inspector for every 4,500 oil and gas wells.	true	/texas/statements/2010/jul/15/jeff-weems/democrat-weems-says-texas-has-one-inspector-every-/	Seeking a seat on the Texas Railroad Commission, Houston lawyer Jeff Weems said the commission’s in charge of making sure a disaster like the BP oil spill doesn’t happen in Texas. The Democratic nominee went on to tell the United Auto Workers caucus at the party’s state convention June 25: "Right now, there is one inspector for every 4,500 wells. You can’t do that job." Understaffing in the extreme? We wondered if Weems got that right. In e-mails, Weems told us he heard there’s one field inspector for every 4,500 wells from Paul Whitehead, who works in a commission office in Midland. Weems said that's higher than the 1-for-3,300 ratio he got earlier from ProPublica, which describes itself as "an independent, non-profit newsroom that produces investigative journalism in the public interest." ProPublica published an article in December 2009 saying the Texas commission had 83 field inspectors, "meaning each person is responsible for almost 3,300 wells, many of them requiring several visits in a year." It quotes Weems saying: "It's one of the worst-kept secrets around the state that the wells that are ostensibly checked once a year aren't. They could double the number of inspectors and still be straining their staff to do their job." Whitehead referred us to the commission’s Austin headquarters where spokeswoman Ramona Nye confirmed that of late, there are 86 inspectors for 394,365 oil and gas wells, including 282,150 active wells. As of May 28, 2010, these included 740 bay and 341 offshore wells in state waters, which extend about 10 miles offshore. Overall, that makes the inspector/wells ratio about 1-to-4,586. Agency charts show the number of wells under the commission's watch is up 11 percent from Jan. 24, 2003. The commission’s executive director, John Tintera, told us that the commission has sought additional inspectors, with mixed results. The Legislature nixed a request for seven inspectors in 2003, he said, but in 2009 it OK’d two new pipeline inspectors and authorized four more well inspectors, contingent on revenue from fees deposited in the state's Oilfield Cleanup Fund. However, the money needed to make the hires did not accumulate. Nye said the agency hasn't decided whether to request funding for more inspectors from the 2011 Legislature. In an e-mail, Weems was critical of the current staffing level: "You cannot actively monitor that many wells - there is no way you can go by, inspect what is going on - check for leaks, condition of the premises, etc., except once every 3-5 years, and then only if you fly." The commission's spokeswoman, Nye, said inspectors drive to well sites instead of flying. Tintera told us every well isn’t inspected every year; instead, inspectors focus on wells where there’s greater production or environmental sensitivity. He initially indicated the commission has enough inspectors to fulfill demands: "What Texas needs is what we have." Tintera later said the commission would "welcome more resources, including inspectors. However, we recognize the budget constraints facing the state. Therefore the RRC prioritizes its inspections, uses outriders (inspectors who work from home) located near the oil fields they inspect to maximize efficiency, and has not included inspector positions in the hiring freeze that is currently at the agency." All in all? Weems accurately recaps the number of oil wells per inspector in Texas. His statement is True.	None	Jeff Weems	None	None	None	2010-07-15T06:00:00	2010-06-25	['None']
pomt-03468	"Rhode Island has a [inmate] recidivism rate of over 60 percent."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/jun/16/harold-metts/state-sen-harold-metts-says-more-60-percent-inmate/	Even a short prison sentence can resonate through a person's life for decades. In recent years, members of the General Assembly have proposed various bills intended to help reformed criminals avoid the stigma of their criminal record once they have completed their sentences at the Adult Correctional Institutions. One such bill passed the Rhode Island Senate on June 6, 2013. S-358, which is now before the House for consideration, would give the Parole Board the authority to issue a "certificate of recovery and re-entry" to any ex-convict who has paid all fines and other penalties imposed by a court and has exhibited good conduct for a certain period of time -- one year if he was convicted of a misdemeanor and three years if he was convicted of a felony. Think of it as a "diploma" for graduating from ACI-U. However, anyone convicted of a felony crime of violence or any ex-con with more than one felony on his record would not be eligible for a certificate. State Sen. Harold M. Metts, D-Providence, told the Senate, "When you think that Rhode Island has a recidivism rate of over 60 percent, imagine the amount of money we can save taxpayers if we opened up the door for people to get gainful employment so they that they wouldn't have to go back to crime." We wondered whether more than 60 percent of inmates actually get in trouble again and end up back in prison. After leaving a message for Metts to ask about his source, we called the Rhode Island Department of Corrections. Spokeswoman Susan Lamkins said the standard used there and at other prison systems is to count how many former inmates end up being sentenced for another crime and returned to prison within three years of their release. The department is in the midst of its latest analysis, looking at how many of the 3,699 inmates released from prison in 2009 -- the Class of 2009, as it were -- end up back in custody. According to the data from the first two years, the recidivism rate for those returning because they have been sentenced for a new crime is 42 percent. (When such a study was last done, with the Class of 2004, that recidivism rate at the two-year mark was 46 percent, so it seems to be declining. The rate for three years was 54 percent, closer to Metts’ "over 60 percent.") When we got through to Metts, he said his estimate was "probably an old number." He referred us to Nick Horton, program coordinator and policy specialist at Open Doors, a Providence organization that helps people who have been released from prison. He noted the 54 percent recidivism rate after three years from the study of inmates released in 2004 But Horton also focused on a very separate category in that study -- 64 percent of offenders released in 2004 ended up back at the ACI within three years because they had been rearrested, couldn't afford bail and were awaiting trial. But there’s a problem with that percentage: not all of those people were true recidivists, in the Corrections Department's definition. Some ended up being exonerated. Some received a sentence that didn't involve jail time. (In the most recent report, 50 percent of the Class of 2009 were brought back to prison to await trial.) Of course, any study that only follows released inmates for three years is going to underestimate the lifetime recidivism rate because, as Metts noted, it fails to account for criminal cases that aren't going to be resolved until after the three-year mark. "Those that are strong spiritually can last a little bit longer, but when you're out and you can't get a job because your record is haunting you, people lose hope," he said. "Even if I was wrong, 42 percent is still way too high and that's not helping the taxpayers. We need to change our public policy to allow people to reclaim their lives so that they can become productive members of society." Our ruling State Sen. Harold Metts said, "Rhode Island has a recidivism rate of over 60 percent." For better or worse, recidivism rates are usually calculated based on how many former inmates are found guilty of a subsequent crime and end up back in prison within three years. The most recent data from the Department of Corrections cover two years and the rate is 42 percent. The most recent study to look at a three-year period, which covered inmates released in 2004, put the rate at 54 percent. The only way to get above 60 percent is to use the older study and look at an entirely different category: the number of ex-convicts who were brought back to the ACI because they had been charged with a new crime or with violating their probation. But that percentage is flawed as well because it includes at least some people who would never have seen a jail cell if they had been able to afford bail. Metts offered his "over 60 percent" as a definitive statistic. It's not. Although most of the measures we saw offered a lower number, those studies only followed the former inmates for three years or less, an artificial cutoff that makes it easier to collect statistics yet doesn't reflect the fact that anyone who goes back to prison after three years is still regarded as a recidivist. The bottom line: the longer inmates are followed, the higher the percentages get. And they get close enough that we regard Metts' claim as Mostly True.

pomt-00157	Says a recent opioid bill that reached his desk had "very little Democrat support."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/24/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-opioid-bill-didnt-get-much-demo/	Did Democrats try to shirk efforts to pass a bill on opioids that President Donald Trump recently signed? Trump said they did at a rally in Lebanon, Ohio, on Oct. 12. He said, "I'll soon sign into the law the largest legislative effort in history to address the opioid crisis where just this year we got $6 billion from Congress — thanks to (Ohio Republican Sen.) Rob Portman and a lot of others — thank you, Rob — but Rob and so many others helped. Very little Democrat support." Was this a mostly Republican-backed bill? Not at all. In fact, it garnered as close as you can come to universal support in this politically polarized era. The bill offered such provisions as barring fentanyl from being imported by mail, expanding the ability of nurses to prescribe medication to counter opioid addiction, and enhanced access to treatment for Medicaid recipients. It was originally introduced in June by several House Republicans and Democrats. The Democrats included Reps. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, Richard Neal of Massachusetts, Frank Pallone of New Jersey, and Tim Walz of Minnesota. The initial version passed the House by a 396-14 margin and the equivalent version passed the Senate by a 99-1 margin. After the chambers ironed out their differences, the final version passed the House 393-8 on Sept. 28 and the Senate 98-1 on Oct. 3. (The only vote against the bill in the Senate — on both versions — was by a Republican, Mike Lee of Utah.) The bill then went to the president, but he hasn’t officially signed it yet. The New York Times called it "rare bipartisan accord." The bill’s bipartisan nature was among the top themes in news coverage. We reached out to the White House but did not hear back. Our ruling Trump said the recent opioid bill had "very little Democrat support." That couldn’t be further from the truth. Virtually every Democrat (and virtually every Republican) voted for the bill on the floor. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-05560	"Before this law, any group could go out anywhere, register voters, sit on the voter registration forms for unlimited amount of time."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/apr/05/lenny-curry/voter-registration-groups-registrations-lenny-curr/	The Republican-led Florida Legislature approved a controversial election law in 2011 that said third-party groups that collect voter registrations must submit them within 48 hours or face fines. Republicans said that the new rules were necessary to prevent fraud, while Democrats said it would suppress the minority vote. Civic groups including the Florida League of Women Voters are challenging the law. A March 2012 New York Times story stated that the law had curtailed voter registration drives in Florida by groups such as the League of Women Voters, Rock the Vote and on college campuses. Since the law took effect, 81,471 fewer Floridians registered than during the same period in 2008, according to the New York Times. It’s difficult to determine how much of the drop in registrations is due to the new law or to other factors, such as less excitement compared to the 2008 race. The new voter registration rule is not in effect in five counties, including Hillsborough County, because those counties require pre-clearance from the federal government under the Voting Rights Act. The day after the article, Florida Republican Party chair Lenny Curry discussed the new rules in an interview on MSNBC on March 28. Host Chris Matthews explained that "the new law dramatically narrows the window that third-party groups are given to submit completed voter registration forms -- without facing a fine, that is. Before the law, they had 10 days. Now we have 48 hours to bring those forms back in." Matthews asked Curry, "Is it reasonable to expect a person to show up within 48 hours with registration forms that they just had filled out say over a weekend?" Curry: "Absolutely. Again, it’s good governance. Before this law, any group could go out anywhere, register voters, sit on the voter registration forms for unlimited amount of time. The individual that registered to vote would have no idea whether or not their voter registration was submitted, and if the right party was submitted." Was Curry correct that before the law, third-party groups could sit on those completed forms for an unlimited amount of time? The 10-day rule The answer depends on whether we rely on a strict reading of the former law or the reality of its enforcement. The old law stated that third-party groups had to submit the registrations within 10 days. (That deadline could potentially be even shorter if election deadlines were approaching in less than 10 days.) But the law didn’t provide a method to track whether the third-party groups complied with that time restriction, said Chris Cate, a spokesman with the Florida Secretary of State. When third-party groups dropped off voter registration applications, the forms did not identify the groups. "They could turn them in a month late, but we wouldn’t know who turned in the forms," Cate said. "Though the law said 10 days, there was no way to know for sure that the groups had met that deadline. People ask how big a problem it was before the (new) law. We really don’t have a way to measure that. There was no way to track how many of these forms were coming in late." Although the old law stated that late registrations could result in fines for third-party groups, no group was fined, Cate said. Under the new law, third-party groups receive an identifying number, which they must place on the voter registration applications they submit. Applications collected by these organizations must be turned into the state Division of Elections or a county supervisor of elections within 48 hours or the next business day if the office is closed for that 48-hour period. Groups can meet the requirement by mailing in the forms. The new law includes fines starting at $50 for each application received after 48 hours and a maximum of $1,000 per calendar year per group. The amounts of the fines are the same as the old law but kick in after 48 hours rather than 10 days. (During the MSNBC interview, host Matthews and Judith Browne-Dianis, co-director of the Advancement Project, a group that fights for voting rights, said it was up to $10,000, which is inaccurate.) Since the new law went into effect in May 2011, the Division of Elections has sent 16 informational letters to third-party groups that didn’t follow the 48-hour rule and recommended that the attorney general fine three groups. There have been no fines as of early April 2012, according to attorney general spokeswoman Jenn Meale. Lee Rowland, an attorney representing the Florida League of Women Voters in its quest to halt implementation of the law, said that even under the old law, there was a mechanism for complaints. Any citizen who believed a community based group didn’t fill out a form in a timely manner could have filled out a complaint form. When the Legislature pursued the 48-hour window, supporters cited anecdotes about third-party groups submitting "dumps" of registrations, Rowland said. But they cited the same anecdotes in 2011 as they did when the Legislature approved the 10-day rule in 2005. After its original passage, the 10-day deadline faced a court challenge. In 2007, it was amended to impose a $1,000 cap on fines and was upheld by the courts. "It seems pretty clear to me the 10-day rule likely took care of any problems the Legislature was concerned about," Rowland said. Republican Party of Florida spokeswoman Kristen McDonald said that during the MSNBC interview, Curry was often interrupted and not given the opportunity to fully explain the context of his statement. "Despite what the law may have said as far as number of days, there was no mechanism or ability of the state to enforce that number of days," she wrote in an email. Our ruling Before the 48-hour registration law was imposed, Curry explained that "any group could go out, register voters, sit on the voter registration forms for unlimited amount of time." Actually, the prior law had a 10-day rule for turning in voter registrations. Curry has a point that the state didn’t enforce the law -- an explanation he originally omitted. The state could have instituted measures to enforce the 10-day rule, instead of moving to the stricter 48-hour rule. Curry's comment gives the impression there was no rule at all. If third-party voter registration groups were sitting on registrations for unlimited amounts of time, even before the new measure, they were breaking the law. We rate Curry's statement Mostly False.

pomt-10074	"The biggest job of the surgeon general is to translate health care and health care needs into plain English."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jan/13/howard-dean/surgeon-general-spokesman-public-health/	President-elect Barack Obama's widely reported intention to appoint Sanjay Gupta, a 39-year-old neurosurgeon and CNN reporter, as the nation's surgeon general has drawn flak from several directions. Gupta is known primarily for his work as a TV reporter, though he's clearly identified as a medical doctor. A number of commentators have attacked Gupta's health care reporting for criticizing Michael Moore's film Sicko in a segment on CNN. A blogger at Gawker joked that Gupta must have beat out Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Some advocates of the Commissioned Corps, a team of federal health workers led by the surgeon general, say the job should go to someone who rose through the ranks. Defenders of the choice, including former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, Democratic National Committee chair Howard Dean, and the consumer advocates at the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest, have cited Gupta's communication skills. Here's how Dean put it in a Jan. 7, 2009, appearance on MSNBC's Hardball : "I think he's a great appointment," Dean told host Chris Matthews. "I'll tell you why he's a great appointment. The biggest job of the surgeon general is to translate health care and health care needs into plain English that people can understand, ordinary people can understand. That's what Sanjay Gupta has been doing for a living for quite a while." Communication is indeed a major part of the job. Surgeons general have long held the symbolic post of the "nation's doctor," offering advice on smoking cessation, obesity, AIDS prevention and a host of other public health issues through speeches, news conferences, congressional testimony and formal reports. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, under which the surgeon general serves, lists this sort of public outreach as the first of seven official duties of the surgeon general. In congressional hearings about the nature of the position in 2007, former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop said "he or she should be the health educator for Americans par excellence." A subsequent surgeon general, David Satcher, said the office has evolved since its inception in 1873 but "what has not changed about the Surgeon General’s Office is its direct responsibility for communicating with the American people based on the best available science, and its responsibility for responding to public health emergencies." So yes, by job description, tradition and widespread consensus, the surgeon general is the medical communicator in chief, you might say. But that's not the whole truth. The surgeon general also oversees the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service, 6,000 uniformed public health workers assigned to other government agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health. His administrative duties over the corps are limited, to be sure, because the positions are funded and the officers overseen day-to-day by the heads of the agencies to which they're assigned. But he sets standards for the corps, has significant administrative responsibilities and serves as the group's titular leader. More significant is the surgeon general's customary responsibility to represent the federal government on various elite boards and commissions. Past surgeons general have sat alongside national and global health experts at the National Library of Medicine, the American Medical Association and the World Health Organization, for example. In these settings, medical gravitas would seem to matter far more than mass-communication skills. But most importantly, Dean glossed over a crucial component of the public outreach part of the job — you have to know what to say. Surgeon generals don't just present public health initiatives, they craft them. Surgeon generals' reports — the landmark example of which is Smoking and Health, the 1964 report in which the government first spelled out to the public that smoking causes lung cancer — are generally years in the making. "It's not like you just sit down and write this report," Richard Carmona, who served as the 17th surgeon general, from 2002 to 2006, said in a telephone interview. "They take a long time and they only happen if you have the credibility and knowledge to extract this information properly. You're working with people at the Centers for Disease Control, the National Institutes of Health, you're looking at heart science, clinical science — your credibility comes in. Your peers have to respect you and see you as a nonpartisan arbiter of the best science." Gupta is a practicing neurosurgeon and an assistant professor of neurosurgery at Emory University School of Medicine, and he writes a column for Time magazine in addition to reporting for CNN. We'll leave it to Congress and others to decide whether that qualifies him to be surgeon general. And if Gupta does get the position, he and Obama have a certain amount of latitude to make of it what they like. But being doctor to the nation has traditionally involved more than just advising it on health issues — you have to check up on it first. Surgeon general is a public health position, not a public affairs position. Communication may be the "biggest part of the job" in a sense, but many other medical and administrative skills are required. We find Dean's statement Half True.

pomt-13543	"All of Texas is conservative, except a little bit of Austin."	false	/texas/statements/2016/aug/26/sean-hannity/sean-hannity-incorrect-all-texas-conservative-save/	Sean Hannity, the Fox News host, took note of a brief protest during the Austin taping of his Aug. 23, 2016, interview of Donald Trump by characterizing the state’s politics. "All right," Hannity said amid shouts, "all of Texas is conservative, except a little bit of Austin." Without question, Austin largely tilts left. At the time Hannity spoke, Travis County had no countywide elected Republicans while its Texas House delegation consisted of five Democrats and one Republican. In 2012, President Barack Obama carried 60 percent of the county’s vote to Republican Mitt Romney’s 36 percent. We focused on Hannity’s larger point — that the rest of Texas is conservative. In Hannity’s favor: No Democrat has won statewide since 1994 (when Democrats won five of 10 statewide non-judicial races). Also, no Democratic presidential nominee has captured the state since Jimmy Carter edged Gerald Ford by 129,019 votes in 1976 (a November so long ago that Donald Trump was only 30 and and Hillary Clinton had just turned 29). Statewide in 2012, Romney beat Obama by more than 1 million votes, carrying 57 percent to Obama’s 41 percent, leaving Texas pretty darned red, per this Politico map: SOURCE: "Election Special, 2012 Texas Presidential Results," Politico, last updated Nov. 19, 2012 But contrary to Hannity’s statement, Austin wasn’t the only blue dot on the 2012 map. Obama won much of the traditionally stalwart-Democratic border region including El Paso County plus the urban counties of Bexar (home to San Antonio); Dallas; Harris (home to Democrat-dominant Houston); and Jefferson (home to union-strong Beaumont). Two years later, Republican Greg Abbott trounced Democrat Wendy Davis for governor, doing well nearly everywhere outside the Mexico border region. Politico’s map (below) shows that beyond border counties, Davis outpolled Abbott only in Travis and Dallas counties. SOURCE: "2014 Texas Governor Election Results," Politico, update Dec. 17, 2014 (accessed Aug. 25, 2016) Otherwise, meantime, Democrats show some local strengths--and not only in Austin or near Mexico. As of August 2016, when Hannity spoke, Dallas County’s judge (the county’s top executive position) was Democrat Clay Jenkins while five other countywide officeholders, including Sheriff Lupe Valdez, were Democrats, per the county’s Democratic Party. District Attorney Susan Hawk was the sole Republican in a countywide elected post. In contrast, neighboring Tarrant County, home to Fort Worth, remained a Republican stronghold; by our count, per a county Republican Party list, Republicans held all six countywide elected posts. Also, the state’s most-populous county, Harris, had just one Democrat in a major countywide post--Vince Ryan, the county attorney. Ryan won re-election in 2012 along with another Democrat, Sheriff Adrian Garcia. Garcia resigned in 2015 to bid for mayor and he was replaced with a Republican, Ron Hickman, who seeks re-election in November 2016. Bexar County, meantime, had a longtime Democratic leader as county judge, Nelson Wolff, as well as Democrats Albert Uresti, the tax assessor-collector, and Nicholas "Nico" LaHood, the county’s criminal district attorney. Then again, voters also had in place a Republican sheriff, Susan Pamerleau, seeking a second term in 2016; a Republican county clerk, Gerard "Gerry" Rickhoff, who’d held the office for more than two decades; and a Republican district clerk, Donna Kay McKinney. We also asked the state parties to assess Hannity’s claim, which by email Mike Joyce of the Republican Party of Texas called "fair." Manny Garcia of the Texas Democratic Party noted Democratic gains in some parts of the state and pointed out that when Texas voters participating in a June 2016 University of Texas poll were asked to place themselves on a seven-point scale running from extremely liberal to extremely conservative, 39 percent chose "in the middle." Otherwise, 18 percent self-identified as liberal, 44 percent as conservative. Our ruling Hannity said: "All of Texas is conservative except a little bit of Austin." If Hannity had solely singled out the state's many rural and suburban counties, he'd have a point.

pomt-09806	Health reform will "give every American the same opportunity" to buy health insurance the way members of Congress do.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/10/barack-obama/national-health-insurance-exchange-has-restriction/	President Barack Obama extolled the virtues of a national health insurance exchange in a speech to a joint session of Congress. "If you lose your job or change your job, you will be able to get coverage," Obama said. "If you strike out on your own and start a small business, you will be able to get coverage. We will do this by creating a new insurance exchange – a marketplace where individuals and small businesses will be able to shop for health insurance at competitive prices." Obama went on to compare this exchange to the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan, which is offered to all federal employees. (We've written about this plan previously.) "Insurance companies will have an incentive to participate in this exchange because it lets them compete for millions of new customers. As one big group, these customers will have greater leverage to bargain with the insurance companies for better prices and quality coverage. This is how large companies and government employees get affordable insurance. It's how everyone in this Congress gets affordable insurance. And it's time to give every American the same opportunity that we've given ourselves," he concluded. But saying every American will get the same opportunity that Congress has to purchase insurance is not correct. There are several key differences between the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan and the national health insurance exchange. The biggest issue is that there are significant limitations on who gets to use the exchange. Right now, the House bill allows in individuals and people who work for small businesses. Pending legislation in the House says that only individuals and small businesses of fewer than 10 employees would be able to use the exchange during the first year, and only individuals and small businesses with fewer than 20 employees in the second year. In the third year, businesses are allowed in "based on the number of full-time employees of an employer and such other considerations as the Commissioner deems appropriate." This sounds like employers will gradually be allowed into the exchange based on size, as well as "other considerations as the (health exchange) Commissioner deems appropriate." But people who can get insurance through a large employer will not be eligible to purchase on the exchange if their employer offers a plan that meets minimum requirements for coverage. We should also add that many employers offer only a few choices of plan. Some only offer one plan. Federal employees, on the other hand, choose from an array of plans, with different levels of coverage. They are part the largest employer-sponsored program in the world, covering over 9 million employees, retirees, former employees, family members and former spouses, according to the Office of Personnel Management's Web site. To say, as Obama does, that "every American" could get similar coverage as Congress on the exchange is not accurate. People who can get insurance through work are specifically excluded under the House bill. Obama lays out the right categories of people who would be allowed to shop ont the exchange in the first part of his statement: people who lose coverage or who are part of a small business. But he crossed a line when he told Congress, "It's time to give every American the same opportunity that we've given ourselves." There are significant limitations on who will be allowed on the exchange. We rate his statement False.

pomt-10477	Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama want to raise capital gains taxes, which apply to home sales.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/16/chain-email/capital-gains-taxes-often-dont-apply-to-homeowners/	A chain e-mail accuses Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama of wanting sharp tax increases, while praising Sen. John McCain for holding the line. ( Click here to read the chain e-mail in its entirety .) The e-mail asserts that Clinton and Obama want to raise capital gains taxes and dividends taxes, as well as raise tax rates for all income levels . We'll look at the capital gains taxes claim here. So what is a capital gains tax? The Internal Revenue Service explains: "Almost everything you own and use for personal purposes, pleasure or investment is a capital asset." When you sell an asset for a profit, that profit margin is your capital gain, and the IRS taxes you on it. Capital gains taxes vary depending on the income level of the tax filer and the length of the investment, with separate tax rates for short-term vs. long-term capital gains. Here's what the e-mail says about capital gains taxes: "CAPITAL GAINS TAX MCCAIN 15% (no change) OBAMA 28% CLINTON 24%" "How does this affect you?" the e-mail asks. "If you sell your home and make a profit, you will pay 28% of your gain on taxes. If you are heading toward retirement and would like to down-size your home or move into a retirement community, 28% of the money you make from your home will go to taxes. This proposal will adversely affect the elderly who are counting on the income from their homes as part of their retirement income." The item lists 15 percent as the current rate, and that is a correct number for long-term capital gains for higher income brackets. Obama has said he would raise the capital gains tax rate to somewhere between 20 percent and 28 percent, depending on how much he needs to pay for his health care plan. (The long-term rate was generally 20 percent prior to the Bush tax cuts.) After we received this e-mail, Clinton addressed the capital gains tax in some detail at a debate in Philadelphia on April 16, 2008. "I wouldn't raise it above the 20 percent if I raised it at all," Clinton said, adding, "I'm going to have to look and see what the revenue situation is." We talked with a spokesman for a business-backed tax policy group and he said he expects either Democrat would raise the capital gains rate. "Unless they just go back on all their campaign promises to raise taxes on high-income people, these are the taxes that they're talking about," said William Ahern of the Tax Foundation, which advocates for a transparent, progrowth tax code. But there's another problem with the e-mail's statements, specifically the implication that all home sales are subject to the capital gains tax. Many home sales are exempt from the capital gains tax. As long as they meet rules requiring that they've lived in their home, homeowers don't have to pay the capital gains tax if the profits on their home are less than $250,000 for a single person or $500,000 for a married couple. The rule applies to workers and retirees alike, said Eric Toder, a tax policy expert with the Urban Institute in Washington, D.C. To summarize, the e-mail is right that Obama wants to raise the capital gains rate, though it pegs the high end of a range he's suggested. Clinton, meanwhile, would consider raising it to 20 percent, not the 24 percent stated in the e-mail. It's also important to note that because the tax code allows for significant capital gains on a homestead before capital gains taxes are levied, most homeowners are exempt. In the end, the e-mail's statements on the capital gains tax are more wrong than right; we rate it Barely True. Update: This statement has been updated to reflect comments the Democratic candidates made about the capital gains tax at a debate in Philadelphia on April 16, 2008. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08161	Providence teachers "can go five or six years without an evaluation."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/dec/03/angel-taveras/taveras-says-providence-teachers-go-five-or-six-ye/	When Mayor-elect Angel Taveras takes over as Providence's chief executive next month, he will inherit the largest and one of the most troubled school systems in the state. Taveras, himself a product of the city's school system, promised during his campaign to push for the development of more rigorous teacher evaluations. In a post-election appearance on WPRI-12's "Newsmakers" last week, Taveras repeated that pledge. "With respect to teachers, we need to recruit the very best teachers, to give them the support they need and to evaluate them," he said. "Let me explain what I mean. Right now teachers can go five or six years without an evaluation. Five or six years! I was shocked to learn that when I was running for office. We're beginning to change that." Unlike the mayor-elect, we'll stop short of saying we were "shocked" to hear that. But, if true, it certainly seems infrequent, particularly for new teachers. Taveras' team didn't provide backup for his statement, so we consulted the Providence teachers contract, available online. We learned that as per the contract, non-tenured teachers, those who have been on the job fewer than three years, must be evaluated once a year by their school principal or another administrator. But Providence teachers automatically become tenured after three years and the vast majority of them -- 94.4 percent of the 1,939 teachers -- are tenured, according to the Providence School Department. For those teachers, the performance review timetable is less specific. The contract stipulates: "Tenured teachers shall be evaluated on a scheduled basis. The schedule shall be constructed by the Teacher Evaluation Committee." That committee, made up of district officials as well as union representatives, has long dictated that tenured teachers be evaluated every five years. That means that once a teacher receives tenure at three years, he or she is not reviewed again until his or her eighth year, then the 13th year and ongoing on a five-year cycle, said Thomas Ramirez, the assistant superintendent of human resources. District officials and Providence Teacher's Union President Steve Smith both say the five-year schedule is nearly always followed. The only exception would be if a principal determines that a particular teacher is struggling and needs a more immediate performance review. So Taveras' claim that teachers can go five years without an evaluation is accurate. Given the district's small number of untenured teachers, most do go that long. The mayor-elect stretches the numbers a bit, however, when he references the six-year figure. We find this statement to be Mostly True. But while we have your attention, we want to mention the larger context. Like Taveras, the teachers union and the district agree that the evaluation system needs improvement. Kim Rose, spokeswoman for the Providence schools, said the district believes teachers need to be evaluated more frequently and with "a more robust evaluation tool." Right now evaluations are more like brief snapshots of a teacher's performance. They typically involve one or more short classroom visits, but no formal analysis of the teacher's lesson plans, or of the performance of his or her students. Both the state Department of Education, led by Education Commissioner Deborah A. Gist and the teachers union have launched efforts to develop more rigorous review policies. The Rhode Island affiliate of the American Federation of Teachers has received multiple grants, including one from the federal government to help in its effort. Over the past several months, the two sides have been working together to merge their initiatives and have suggested they could unveil a shared evaluation model next year. Whether Providence moves forward with the change that stakeholders on all sides say they want will be, in part, up to Taveras. After months of critiquing the schools that educated him, the mayor-elect will soon have a direct hand in shaping the School Department that educated him. We'll be watching to see whether he makes good on those promises.	None	Angel Taveras	None	None	None	2010-12-03T00:01:00	2010-11-27	['None']
pomt-04300	Says Charlie Bass supports Paul Ryan plan that forces seniors to pay $6,400 a year more for health care so millionaires can pay less in taxes.	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/oct/31/house-majority-pac/does-supporting-ryan-budget-plan-mean-you-want-sen/	If there’s any doubt the role Nashua, NH will play in the upcoming election, look no further than Main Street. A recent campaign television commercial attacking U.S. Rep Charlie Bass, R-NH, features men and women holding handwritten signs up and down Main Street, quoting Bass calling GOP vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan’s Medicare plan "A great statement of principle." The advertisement was put out by The House Majority PAC -- not to be confused with The New Hampshire House Republican Victory PAC. The House Majority PAC is a committee "designed help win back the House Majority for Democrats," according to its website, and calls Bass out for voting for Ryan’s plan to "essentially end Medicare to give more tax breaks to millionaires." "Charlie Bass said, ‘I voted for Chairman Ryan’s plan because it is a great statement of principle,’" the narrator states. "Seniors would pay $6,400 a year more for health care so millionaires can pay less in taxes. That's Charlie Bass' great statement of principle." PolitiFact has heard similar claims about Ryan’s budget resolutions many times before. But we hadn’t examined whether those savings would go to bankroll tax cuts for millionaires. Even looking at the health care question alone can get tricky because some earlier, related claims reference Ryan’s plan for 2012, which was proposed in 2011. It is important to note the "Principle" ad revolves around a statement Bass made after he voted to support Ryan’s 2013 budget resolution, and cites a March 29, 2012 article in the Manchester Union Leader, although Bass did vote for Ryan’s plan in 2011. The Romney-Ryan Medicare plan PolitiFact has checked this claim through a President Barack Obama television advertisement that said Ryan’s plan could raise "future retirees’ costs more than $6,000," noting that Ryan released his initial Medicare plan in early 2011. Under this plan, Medicare would have changed from a program that pays doctors and hospitals fees for particular services to one in which beneficiaries would be paid an amount by the government that they could use toward private insurance premiums, affecting people who today are under 55 only. The plan was approved by the GOP-controlled House before dying in the Senate. Ryan offered updated versions of the plan as part of his fiscal year 2013 budget proposal, with two key differences from the original. The newer version allows beneficiaries under 55 a choice -- they can use their payment to buy private insurance or for a plan that acts like traditional Medicare. Meanwhile, the size of the payment would be set by the market -- the price of the second-cheapest plan. So is the most recent Ryan plan also official policy for the Romney campaign? It appears to be. In an interview with a Green Bay, Wis., television station back on Aug. 15, Romney said, "Paul Ryan and my plan for Medicare, I think, is the same, if not identical -- it's probably close to identical." This history is important because of how opponent campaigns frame the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan in their ads. The $6,400 question Ads using the claim of a $6,400 increase in out-of-pocket costs cite a report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. Here’s what the group said: "In 2022, the first year the voucher would apply, (the Congressional Budget Office) estimates that total health care expenditures for a typical 65-year-old would be almost 40 percent higher with private coverage under the Ryan plan than they would be with a continuation of traditional Medicare," center president Bob Greenstein wrote. "CBO also finds that this beneficiary's annual out-of-pocket costs would more than double — from $6,150 to $12,500. In later years, as the value of the voucher eroded, the increase in out-of-pocket costs would be even greater." The difference between $12,500 (the out-of-pocket costs under the Ryan plan in 2022) and $6,150 (the out-of-pocket costs that year under traditional Medicare) is $6,350, which is very close to $6,400. In an interview, Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, emphasized that the numbers his group used came from CBO, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress, and that the center’s role was just to take the CBO analysis and make it "more understandable." In fact, different groups have made slightly different calculations of the out-of-pocket increase -- the Kaiser Family Foundation, for instance, tabulated the number to be $6,870 -- but the estimates we’ve seen are all in the same ballpark. But the problem is the CBO analysis, and the others built on those CBO numbers, refer to the original Ryan plan, not to the current one. The current plan is slightly more generous in how fast it allows subsidies to grow as health care costs increase, while still keeping spending lower than current projections. Ryan also made a number of other technical changes to address concerns that the credits wouldn’t keep up if medical costs kept going up and up. As we mentioned before, the amount a beneficiary receives, for example, would be based on the second least-expensive plan available on a Medicare exchange. That means while the traditional Medicare offering — if it’s more expensive than the second-least expensive plan — could cost seniors more out-of-pocket, it’s unlikely to cost them as much as estimates for Ryan’s earlier plan. "CBO has not analyzed the policies that might be implemented to produce such a path for Medicare spending, including a premium-support approach to Medicare of the sort that Chairman Ryan and other Members of Congress have recently discussed," CBO wrote earlier this year. The Obama campaign has said it would be happy to update its numbers if CBO or the Romney-Ryan campaign provided new data, but neither has. Peter Orszag, Obama’s former Office of Management and Budget director, recently wrote that "if Ryan believes that changes to his plan since (the original plan was released) would result in any different conclusions, he should request that CBO publish an updated analysis." There is one clue that the number wouldn’t be close to $6,400. A study published Aug. 1, 2012, in the Journal of the American Medical Association says that if Ryan’s plan had been in place in 2009, the cost of the second-cheapest Medicare Advantage plan (and thus the size of the premium support payment) would have been 9 percent less than traditional Medicare. That would have required an out-of-pocket payment for seniors who wanted to use traditional Medicare of $64 a month — which adds up to about $800 a year. Van de Water said one should specify which version of the Ryan plan they’re talking about if they’re going to speculate. But he did say that the Obama campaign’s decision to use the old numbers was defensible. "It also seems reasonable to cite the most recent available analysis" when Ryan has not provided enough detail to do a new one. How about those millionaires But what about the charge that Bass is supporting changes to Medicare so "millionaires can pay less in taxes"? For that portion of the claim, the House Majority PAC cited an April 2011 Wall Street Journal article about Ryan’s 2012 budget proposal, titled "GOP Aim: Cut $4 Trillion." They singled out this sentence: "Conservative activists who are familiar with the Ryan plan said they expect it to call for a fundamental overhaul of the tax system, with a 25% top rate for both individuals and corporations, compared to the current 35% top rate." They also pointed to another Center on Budget and Policy Priorities report, published a year later, titled "New Tax Cuts in Ryan Budget Would Give Millionaires $265,000 on Top of Bush Tax Cuts." The report cites Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center findings that say people earning more than $1 million a year would receive an average of $265,000 apiece in new tax cuts under Ryan’s plan, on top of the $129,000 they would receive from the Ryan budget’s extension of President Bush’s tax cuts. PolitiFact has found that there’s not a direct link between the proposed changes to Medicare and tax rates for the wealthy. They’re separate policy areas, and legislation affecting each area would typically be handled separately. Nevertheless, choices about spending and taxes are not entirely unrelated, given the imbalance in the federal budget in recent years and the significant debt that is building up, said Maya MacGuineas, president of the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. PolitiFact asked her about the Democratic claims we’ve noticed this year in congressional races around the country, where ads claim that specific spending cuts "pay for" tax breaks for the wealthy. "It’s a huge fight over priorities and semantics," she said. "But it’s difficult to say that one is linked to the other." Still, she added, hard choices are ahead for the federal budget in terms of both taxes and spending. "No one should be talking about any tax cuts or spending increases until we have a plan to get the budget under control," she said. Our ruling: PolitiFact gave President Obama a Half True for an ad that would have been more accurate if it specified it referred to a previous Ryan plan for Medicare, rather than the current one. In The House Majority PAC’s case, it plays off a Bass quote about his support of the 2013 congressional budget plan, then uses calculations for the plan Ryan proposed the previous year. Bass did vote for both Ryan plans, but the 2013 plan lacks enough details to truly determine how much more money seniors may have to pay for Medicare. And where President Obama used the phrase "could" to cite cost increases by more than $6,000 -- giving his claim a little more wiggle room -- The House Majority PAC uses the phrase "would," taking the $6,400 estimation a step further because it implies greater certainty. On top of that, experts say it’s too difficult to determine how the Romney/Ryan proposed changes to Medicare have a direct link to the tax rates that would be set for the wealthy. We give them a Mostly False.	None	House Majority PAC	None	None	None	2012-10-31T17:58:38	2012-09-26	['None']
pomt-05230	Says he "cut the budget."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/jun/06/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-says-state-treasurer-he-cut-budget/	Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, the Republican hoping to unseat incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown from the U.S. Senate in November, makes at least five separate claims in a attacking Brown or promoting his own candidacy. Among the ad’s claims: Mandel "cut the budget." Cut the budget? How did Mandel cut it? Setting the state budget is the job of the governor and General Assembly. PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look and put the question to Mandel’s campaign. They backed up the statement by citing a report released by the treasurer's office last July after a self-described "top to bottom review" from his first six months in office. "By targeting waste and improving operations," it says, the treasurer’s office ended the 2011 fiscal year with a $400,000 surplus that was returned to the general fund. The general revenue fund operating budget for the 2012-13 biennium was reduced by $1.2 million, the report says. The reductions in expenses range from $2,000 that had been used for an outside contract for a plant-watering service to $850,000 saved by reducing budgeted full-time employees from 140 to 127. We looked at supporting documentation from the Legislative Service Commission and Office of Budget and Management, and at news coverage of treasurer's office operations. The coverage included reports that the treasurer’s overall budget had actually increased, from $38.3 million in fiscal 2011 to $41 million in 2012, the current fiscal year. Looking more closely, however, we found that the treasurer’s overall budget includes state funds and benefits programs administered by the treasurer's office. The general revenue fund total, the portion of the budget that covers operating expenses, does decrease from the 2010-2011 biennium to 2012-2013, according to the Legislative Service Commission. The amount appropriated by the General Assembly for operating expenses -- the spending over which the treasurer has the most direct control -- decreased from $8.2 million in fiscal 2011 to $7.7 in fiscal 2012 and 2013, according to the legislative Service Commission. So where does Mandel’s claim that he "cut the budget" rate on the Truth-O-Meter? His statement is accurate. His office finished the last fiscal year with a surplus and his office cited specific steps it took to spend less money. Also, the money appropriated for operating expenses for this fiscal year and the next fiscal year is reduced from the FY 2011 total. There is additional information, though, that provides clarification. As seen in the ad, some listeners might interpret his bare claim that he cut the budget as meaning he trimmed the state budget. Money for the state budget, including the treasurer’s office, is set by the General Assembly and the governor. And the overall total appropriated for his office in FY 2012 and FY2013, when including state funds and benefits programs administered by the treasurer's office, is actually greater than FY 2011. On the Truth-O-Meter, Mandel’s claim rates Mostly True.	None	Josh Mandel	None	None	None	2012-06-06T06:00:00	2012-05-23	['None']
pomt-09134	The Obama administration "has been constrained by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which basically gives the responsible party the lead role in trying to not only fix the problem, but contain the problem."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/15/donna-brazile/oil-pollution-act-trips-brazile-abcs-week/	Democratic strategist Donna Brazile tried to rebut criticism that President Barack Obama isn't doing enough to control the Gulf of Mexico oil spill response, arguing on ABC's This Week that he has been hamstrung by the actions of Congress 20 years ago. In a back and forth with former labor secretary Robert Reich, Brazile said Congress created a policy that puts BP -- not the federal government -- in charge of the response. "The present spectacle of the Coast Guard asking BP to speed up this clean-up is absurd. I mean, the federal government needs to be in charge," Reich, a former Labor Secretary under President Bill Clinton, said. "The president needs to be in charge of this. Use BP's expertise. Use BP's resources. But the president must be in charge of all of this. Otherwise, he looks like he's just standing on the sidelines." "Well," Brazile said, "the administration has been constrained by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which basically gives the responsible party the lead role in trying to not only fix the problem, but contain the problem," Brazile responded. "That has been the problem from day one. They've waited for BP to come up with the answers, and we know that BP continues to mislead people." In this fact-check, we wanted to see if Brazile's interpretation of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 is right -- particularly when it comes to deciding who has the lead role. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 was passed in the aftermath of the Exxon Valdez spill in Prince William Sound in 1989. The law was designed to better coordinate the government response to a major oil event, and to set penalties for companies responsible. It was approved by Congress and signed into law on Aug. 18, 1990. In general, it gives the president more authority in an oil event, not less. "When responding to a spill, many considered the lines of responsibility under the pre-OPA regime to be unclear, with too much reliance on spillers to perform proper cleanup," according to a Congressional Research Service report. "OPA strengthened and clarified the federal government's role in oil spill response and cleanup." The Oil Pollution Act included amendments to the Clean Water Act to provide the president three options in the wake of an oil event, the Congressional Research Service concluded. The president could: Perform cleanup immediately ("federalize" the spill); Monitor the response efforts of the spiller; Or, direct the spiller's cleanup activities. The Environmental Protection Agency describes the OPA this way: "The OPA improved the nation's ability to prevent and respond to oil spills by establishing provisions that expand the federal government's ability, and provide the money and resources necessary, to respond to oil spills." BP ultimately is liable for the cost of cleaning up the spilled oil. The Oil Pollution Act caps additional economic damages at $75 million, but BP has said it will pay all legitimate claims, and some Democrats in Congress want to lift the cap and apply it retroactively. President Obama has said he wants to update the laws to "make sure that the people in the Gulf, the fishermen, the hotel owners, families who are dependent for their livelihoods in the Gulf, that they are all made whole and that we are in a much better position to respond to any such crisis in the future." Still, under the law as it stands today, BP will be paying for the clean-up, and the federal government -- thanks to the OPA -- ultimately has authority over how the clean-up proceeds. We asked Brazile, a native of New Orleans who still has family living there, if there was something we were missing. Brazile said she was trying to point out that the Oil Pollution Act, and the options the president had, may have contributed to the federal government not taking the lead sooner. "The Administration had every reason to take the lead and not wait," Brazile said. "Perhaps they waited -- and I used the reference to the Act -- as one reason why they did not take the initial lead." Brazill also suggested her statement -- which was criticized by the conservative website Newsbusters -- was being used to score political points in the middle of a national crisis. Her first concern, she said, is that people in the Gulf states suffering get help. But in this case, her interpretation of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, is incorrect. She said the law "basically gives the responsible party the lead role in trying to not only fix the problem, but contain the problem." In fact, the Oil Pollution Act specifcially gives the federal government the authority to decide who's in charge of the clean-up -- the polluter or the government. The company, in this case BP, will pay for the clean-up response. But the federal government can give the orders if it chooses. We rate Brazile's statement False.

pomt-06892	"The deficit was on track to top $1 trillion the year I took office."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/27/barack-obama/obama-says-deficit-was-track-top-1-trillion-year-h/	In a televised address to the nation on July 25, 2011, to discuss the pending deadline on the debt ceiling, President Barack Obama laid out his version of how the deficit situation got to where it is. And Obama placed much of the blame at the feet of his predecessor, George W. Bush. "For the last decade, we’ve spent more money than we take in," Obama said. "In the year 2000, the government had a budget surplus. But instead of using it to pay off our debt, the money was spent on trillions of dollars in new tax cuts, while two wars and an expensive prescription drug program were simply added to our nation’s credit card. "As a result, the deficit was on track to top $1 trillion the year I took office." We've dealt with the "what-Obama-inherited" question before. Obama's suggestion that the deficit woes the country now faces are the result of Bush's tax cuts and an expensive prescription drug program -- rather than the recession -- is certainly debatable. But since many Republicans are blaming the problem on reckless spending by Obama, we decided to check his claim that "the deficit was on track to top $1 trillion the year I took office." In January, 2009, just prior to Obama being sworn in as president, the government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released an estimate of the projected deficit for the 2009 fiscal year (which straddled both Bush's and Obama's terms). According to the CBO report, "The ongoing turmoil in the housing and financial markets has taken a major toll on the federal budget. CBO currently projects that the deficit this year will total $1.2 trillion, or 8.3 percent of GDP." The CBO cited a number of factors for why the federal fiscal situation would be "dramatically worse" in 2009 than 2008. According to the CBO, "A drop in tax revenues and increased federal spending (much of it related to the government’s actions to address the crisis in the housing and financial markets) both contribute to the robust growth in this year’s deficit. Compared with receipts last year, collections from corporate income taxes are anticipated to decline by 27 percent and individual income taxes by 8 percent; in normal economic conditions, they would both grow by several percentage points. In addition, the estimated deficit includes outlays of more than $180 billion to reflect the cost of transactions of the TARP." In addition, the CBO noted, as a result of the recession, the federal government boosted spending on programs such as those providing unemployment compensation and nutrition assistance. Again, this was the deficit projection for 2009 before Obama took office. The CBO acknowledged it might get worse. "That total ($1.2 trillion deficit), however, does not include the effects of any future legislation," the CBO noted. "Enactment of an economic stimulus package, for example, would add to the 2009 deficit." As we know, of course, the Democrat-controlled Congress did pass a massive economic stimulus package. And, in fact, due in large part to the stimulus, the actual deficit for 2009 ended up about $200 billion more than the CBO projected in January 2009. An April study from the Pew Charitable Trust found that a combination of factors -- increased government spending, tax cuts and the economic downturn -- were mostly to blame for the large budget deficits. But Dean Baker, a liberal economist and co-director of the center for Economic Policy Research, argued in a piece published on the Huffington Post on July 27, 2011, that it's really the recession, and not any policy decisions from the Bush presidency, that are to blame for the unsustainable deficit projections. If the unemployment rate returned to the 4.7 percent rate of 2007, he wrote, the bulk of the deficit would disappear. To lay the budget crisis on Bush tax cuts is misleading, Baker wrote. "In its budget projections from January 2008, the last set before the impact of the collapse of the housing bubble was clear, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected a deficit of just $198 billion for 2009," Baker wrote. "This is less than one-fifth of the 'on track to top $1 trillion' figure that President Obama gave in his speech. This is a serious error. Rather, Baker wrote, "It was the recession, and the response to it, that pushed the deficit in 2009 from the $198 billion projected by CBO to the over $1 trillion noted by President Obama in his speech." "No one can justify wasting money on wars that should not have been fought, giving away tax breaks to people who don't need them, or deliberately designing a prescription drug benefit so that it needlessly hands hundreds of billions of dollars to drug companies and insurers," Baker wrote. "But even with all of this waste, the deficit was still not out of control." We're not going to wade into the debate over how much of the deficit to assign to Bush or Obama's policies. Obama may be laying too much blame for the deficit crisis on Bush policies, and not enough on the recession. But the economic downturn was in full bloom when Obama took office and he is correct that before he enacted any policies as president, the CBO projected a 2009 deficit of $1.2 trillion (as well as significant projected deficits in years to come as well).

pomt-10044	"The Obama Administration wants to have soldiers and officers pledge a loyalty oath directly to the office of the President, and no longer to the Constitution."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/11/chain-email/bloggers-military-oath-bogus/	Two weeks ago, Matthew Avitabile, a 22-year-old grad student in upstate New York, decided to write a tongue-in-cheek blog item that said President Obama wanted soldiers to stop taking an oath to the Constitution and instead pledge their loyalty to the president himself. Under the fake name Michele Chang — a name he dreamed up because he had just been talking to someone named Michele — Avitabile wrote a bogus news story that quoted a statement from White House spokesman Robert Gibbs saying, "The president feels that the military has been too indoctrinated by the old harbingers of hate: nationalism, racism, and classism. By removing an oath to the American society, the soldiers are less likely to commit atrocities like those at Abu Ghraib." Avitabile labeled it satire in a note beneath the story, but in the superheated world of political blogs, where passions often run faster than reason, that wasn't enough. The label got left off and his bogus story was quickly copied and pasted on blogs, zapped around the country through chain e-mails, and discussed in YouTube commentaries. Many people didn't bother to verify it and responded with comments of outrage. " Who does this megalomaniac think he is?" someone commented on the Web site Digg. "Good g*d---Obama is an egomaniac like we've never seen before. Another Hitler on the rise. This guy is just trashing everything the Consitution stands for," wrote someone named Kitty on the blog Tree of Liberty. Someone identified as bill122460 posted a commentary about it on YouTube titled " OBAMA S HITLER OATH THIS IS MESSED UP ." "He don't belong in office," bill122460 said in the five-minute commentary. "End of story." He added that it was "a Hitler oath. I told you! Welcome to the United States of Nazi Germany!" It's clear that bill122460 and many other people didn't know it was satire. Some of the blog postings referred to Michele Chang as if she were a well-known (and real) writer. "Michele Chang: bama wants to have soldiers and officers pledge a loyalty oath directly to bama, not the Constitution," said one. Some blogs were eventually corrected, or people posted comments that said the article was a fake, but others still carry the fake article. Brent Johnson, a radio host who posted the item on his Voice of Freedom blog, said he posted it without verifying it because "This is one of those stories where, if it is true, is so, so serious. It’s the kind of thing people need to know about in the chance it is true." But now that Johnson has heard it is a satire, he said he will revise or remove the item. Avitabile, a Republican who had previously poked fun at Obama with a tongue-in-cheek article that said scientists had determined that he was "genetically superior," is thankful for all the traffic it generated for his blog Jumping in Pools. In the past he was lucky to get 1,000 hits on a story, but this one got more than 50,000. Yet he's disappointed that so many people published his work without verifying it. "Out of the 50,000 who looked at it, only three had the good sense to contact me and see if it was true," he told us (PolitiFact was one of the three). Avitabile described himself as a moderate Republican — "I'm pro-gay rights, pro-wind energy" — but said he was surprised that so many in his party had such negative feelings about Obama. "People wanted to believe this about the president so bad, that he would really go toward a dictatorship so much that they would go with it without checking it," he said. Indeed, we all know that passions run high in politics, but it's remarkable to us that so many people would pass along something that is so obviously ridiculous without verifying it. But we should have expected this. During the campaign, we found people were passing along e-mails claiming that Obama wanted to adopt the Coke theme song as the National Anthem . So now, as we did for that one, we've got to set the meter ablaze. And this claim is not just Pants on Fire wrong. It's a reminder that if you get something shocking in your inbox, you should check it out before you pass it along.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2009-02-11T15:11:49	2009-01-30	['None']
pomt-03821	Said the year before he took office, the state lost 119,000 private-sector jobs, labeling them "Corzine jobs losses of 2009."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/mar/21/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-119000-private-sector-jobs-l/	Jon Corzine may be nearly four years removed from the governor’s office, but that hasn’t stopped Chris Christie from invoking the Democrat’s name when he wants to make a point about how far New Jersey has come since Corzine left government. Christie brought up his name in a keynote address on March 6 to the commercial real estate development association at the Sheraton Edison Hotel Raritan Center, where he talked about how many private-sector jobs the state lost during Corzine’s last year in office. Christie said the year before he took office, the state lost 119,000 private-sector jobs, labeling them "Corzine jobs losses of 2009." Christie’s number is in the ballpark. Let’s explain how job gains and losses are measured before we look at the Republican governor’s numbers and whether Corzine is truly to blame for those lost jobs. First, we review data that is seasonally adjusted, meaning the data takes into account those jobs that result from seasonal hiring patterns. When looking at annual data, we review December over December to get the most accurate picture of employment for that 12-month period. Now let’s look at numbers from both the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development. Both agencies show New Jersey had 3,209,900 private-sector jobs in December 2009. A year prior, the state had 3,325,600 private-sector jobs. That’s a net loss of 115,700 jobs. Joseph J. Seneca, an economics professor with the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, agreed with that figure. It’s worth noting that in other fact-checks about private-sector job gains and losses in New Jersey, Christie had cited a figure of 117,000. By either measure, Christie’s numbers are off a bit. One reason is that the BLS has "benchmarked" its numbers, according to the state Labor Department. "Benchmarking at BLS has taken place, which is a backward look at the numbers and adjustments based on newer, fuller data," Labor Department spokesman Brian Murray explained in an e-mail. "It is done annually, and the look back goes anywhere from two years to further back." BLS spokeswoman Stacey Standish confirmed how benchmarking works. Next, we need to determine whether Corzine really is to blame for those lost jobs. Let’s point out that the first half of 2009 – Corzine’s last year in office – was marked by recession. The National Bureau of Economic Research, a private nonprofit research group, has said the ‘Great Recession’ began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009. Lingering effects from the economic slowdown, however, have continued. Also, as economic experts have told us for previous and similar rulings about private-sector job growth in New Jersey, the governor not only can’t take all the credit for job gains, he can’t pin blame for loss solely on another administration when there are other factors at work. Christie spokesmen Michael Drewniak and Kevin Roberts did not return a request for comment. Our ruling Christie said the year before he took office, the state lost 119,000 private-sector jobs, labeling them "Corzine jobs losses of 2009." Christie is off a bit, since data from the BLS and state Labor Department show that New Jersey lost 115,700 jobs from December 2008 to 2009 – a period marked by the height of the recession, and something that economic experts have told us cannot be blamed solely on one person. Since the governor’s number is off slightly and the claim implies that Corzine is to blame for those job losses, we give Christie a ruling that he’s had before on these types of fact-checks: Half True.

pomt-10497	As first lady, Clinton would travel to places that were "too small, too poor or too dangerous" for the president.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/04/hillary-clinton/she-was-no-emissary-to-the-obscure/	Right before delivering a speech on Iraq policy at George Washington University on March 17, 2008, Hillary Clinton reflected on her days traveling as first lady. It was then that she said she remembered landing under sniper fire in Bosnia, a claim that's been widely debunked. (Including by us: We called it a Pants on Fire fib.) She also said, "There was a saying around the White House that if a place was too small, too poor or too dangerous, the president couldn't go, so send the first lady, and that's where we went." We analyzed Clinton's international travel based on recently released White House schedules, interviews with traveling companions and scholars, as well as news reports from those trips. We found that Clinton went to many places that were large, wealthy and safe. We documented travel to 82 countries, and the top 10 list looks like an itinerary any travel agent could sell. Our analysis showed that when Hillary Clinton traveled without her husband during the eight years she was first lady, she spent the most days in these countries: Morocco 7 Austria 6 India 6 Italy 6 Switzerland 6 Turkey 6 Czech Republic 5 Egypt 5 Israel 5 Poland 5 They may not be the top NATO allies, but we can't consider any of these countries to meet the trifecta of small, poor and dangerous. Yes, she did go to places like Iceland (pretty small), Eritrea (poor) and Bosnia (arguably dangerous at the time she visited). But her travel itinerary is hardly a tour of the world's most obscure countries. Rather, her travels tended to emphasize stable allies of the United States, many of which are quite populous. To view our interactive map of Clinton's foreign trips as first lady, click here. When she traveled with President Clinton, her schedule may have been a little more glamorous, with more time spent in France, England and Russia. But her solo itinerary was no tour of tiny, dangerous places. So we find her statement to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2008-04-04T00:00:00	2008-03-17	['Bill_Clinton']
pomt-07995	"Recent studies have confirmed that any academic benefits of government funded preschool disappear by the fourth grade."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jan/16/glenn-grothman/wisconsin-state-sen-glenn-grothman-says-recent-res/	On Dec. 21, 2010, the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction issued a news release celebrating the expansion of 4-year-old kindergarten. The programs are now part of 85 percent of the state’s school districts. In all, 41,176 state children are enrolled in 4-K programs offered by 350 school districts and 84 private schools through the parental choice program. State Schools Superintendent Tony Evers attributed the growth to the fact "school districts know the value of early education for young children." On Dec. 29, 2010, state Sen. Glenn Grothman, R-West Bend, issued his own take. He believes school districts use 4-K to pad their budgets with additional state aid and that the programs are a pet project of the teachers’ unions. He urged Republican Gov. Scott Walker to "immediately announce he will not provide any more money for four-year-old kindergarten." Grothman said it was critical that Walker act soon because the Madison school district is adding 4-K in 2011, a move he says will cost $10 million a year in state aid. In the release, Grothman said there was a "lack of any credible evidence that 4-K programs are beneficial to young children." He added: "Recent studies have confirmed that any academic benefits of government funded preschool disappear by the fourth grade." Welcome to the latest installment of the kindergarten wars, where students, parents, academics, policy groups and politicians of all stripes mix it up like, well, kids in one of those play areas filled with plastic balls. We asked Grothman to back up his statement, which presents the value of 4-year-old kindergarten as a settled issue, one "confirmed" by the studies. He pointed us to a 2006 report by the "free-market" Pacific Research Institute, a 2006 report by the libertarian Reason Foundation, and a Dec. 20, 2010, e-mail from Reason Foundation staffer Lisa Snell that summarized programs around the country and included a transcript from an Oklahoma City television news report. The studies are from 2006, which is not all that recent. And both are from groups that come at issues from a particular point of view, not independent academic researchers. Let’s take a look. The Pacific Research Institute report was commenting on a ballot proposition in California that would give students a year of voluntary 4-K in public schools. It concluded: "Given the empirical holes that exist in the evidence for universal preschool, it would seem premature in the extreme to entrench an untested, expensive program, run by poorly performing government bureaucracies, into the state constitution." The Reason Foundation report cited a National Center for Educational Statistics study of 22,000 children and said it found "no lasting reading, math, or science achievement differences between children who attend half day and full-day kindergarten." It concluded: "We find widespread adoption of preschool and full-day kindergarten is unlikely to improve student achievement." The e-mail from Snell, one of the authors of the Reason Foundation’s study, noted that Oklahoma's fourth-grade reading score in 1998, when it adopted universal preschool, was 219. Her comments noted: "Last year, it had dropped to 217 -- three points below the national average. Similarly, its math score was at par with the national average in 2000. Last year, it had dropped two points below. Since employing universal preschool, not only is Oklahoma doing worse compared with the nation -- but also its own prior performance." Now a broader view. The 4-K programs in question have been around for decades. A rudimentary review shows they have been studied at length. We found a huge body of research -- including entire academic institutes and researchers at politically oriented think tanks -- devoted to the subject. We are not trying to settle the question of whether the programs are good or bad for performance of young students. We are looking at Grothman’s claim that the recent studies effectively close the debate on the question. We turned to several national experts, including Steve Barnett, director of the National Institute for Early Education Research, based at Rutgers University. According to that group’s website, Barnett: "reviewed 22 long-term studies of the effects of preschool in a 1993 article entitled Does Head Start Fade Out? Each study followed children from preschool until at least 3rd grade. Results from these studies show that initial gains in children's IQ scores tended to disappear over time. However, gains in graduation rates, as well as declines in special education placements and grade retention, were maintained." Barnett added: "There is considerable evidence that preschool programs of many types -- including Head Start -- have persistent effects on academic ability and success. There is no convincing evidence that these effects decline over time." A summary of recent research on 4-K programs by the institute cites 20 academic reports and studies. It makes no mention of work conducted by the Reason Foundation or the Pacific Research Institute. Another study, which looked at 123 comparative studies of early childhood interventions, concluded: "significant effects were found in this study for children who attend a preschool program prior to entering kindergarten. Although the largest effect sizes were observed for cognitive outcomes, a preschool education was also found to impact children’s social skills and school progress." Finally, an Education Week commentary by Nobel Prize winning University of Chicago economist James Heckman, who was part of a pre-kindergarten study, concluded: "I now believe that early interventions with children are not so productive if they are not followed up with ongoing investments in children during their elementary and secondary school years. Instead, we need to invest early in children — and not stop. And by ‘invest’ I do not simply mean that government should be pumping money into new social programs for disadvantaged youths." OK, time for recess. The debate over 4-K is about more than whether kids benefit in their later schooling. It’s about money, politics, social agendas and more. For support of his position, Grothman said recent reports "confirm" that academic benefits are soon lost. Some studies reached that conclusion. But Grothman is citing one small portion of a much broader debate and declaring the whole matter settled when there is considerable evidence on the other side. We rate Grothman’s statement False.

pomt-10482	Obama supports "teaching schoolchildren — in 2nd grade, no less — about homosexual relationships."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/15/focus-family-action/one-comment-does-not-a-platform-make/	A letter from the conservative group Focus on the Family Action makes a multifaceted attack on Sen. Barack Obama in an attempt to portray him as someone who would be "the most left-wing president in our nation's history." The article, written for the organization's Web site and widely circulated via chain e-mail, tries to paint Obama as bad for families, accusing him of everything from trying to further "the homosexual agenda" to being soft on the war against terrorists. Focus on the Family Action is the lobbying arm of Focus on the Family, an organization founded by evangelical Christian Dr. James Dobson. One of the claims in the article, written by Tom Minnery, senior vice president of Focus on the Family Action, states: "Then there's his support for teaching schoolchildren — in 2nd grade, no less — about homosexual relationships." This is a reference to a question that was asked in a Democratic debate in New Hampshire in September 2007. During the debate, Allison King of New England Cable News talked about a controversial fairy tale about a prince who marries another prince that was taught to a second-grade class in Massachusetts. The Dutch tale, called King and King, is about a prince whose mother pressures him to find a princess but who ends up falling in love with and marrying a princess' brother. Two parents filed a lawsuit, saying they were upset that a book with homosexual themes was taught to their 7-year-olds without alerting them first. The lawsuit was dismissed. King asked if the Democratic candidates would be comfortable having the story read to their children as part of their school curriculum. The question was first put to Sen. John Edwards, who responded, "Yes, absolutely." Edwards went on to say that he wants his children to understand the discrimination that gay and lesbian couples face. Asked how he felt about it, Obama responded, "You know, I feel very similar to John. You know, the fact is my 9-year-old and my 6-year-old I think are already aware that there are same-sex couples. My wife and I have talked about it. One of the things I want to communicate to my children is not to be afraid of people who are different, because there have been times in our history where I was considered different, or Bill Richardson was considered different. "And one of the things I think the next president has to do is to stop fanning people's fears. If we spend all our time feeding the American people fear and conflict and division, then they become fearful and conflicted and divided. "And if we feed them hope and we feed them reason and tolerance, then they will become tolerant and reasonable and hopeful." Minnery said that means Obama supports teaching about homosexuality in elementary schools. "That's obviously the agenda of that book," Minnery said. "If you assent to teaching that book, you assent to that agenda. It's the same thing. They didn't say, 'I'm no longer speaking as a Democratic candidate.' " Obama's campaign did not respond to questions about the Focus on the Family Action statement. But there's nothing in Obama's stated education platform that speaks to any initiative to require or encourage teaching second-graders about homosexuality. In fact, the question in the debate was whether the candidates would be comfortable if that book was taught to their child in school. Obama said he would be okay with it. Focus on the Family's statement is a stretch at best. We rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.

pomt-11621	Reauthorizing the Children’s Health Insurance Program "for six years saves $1 billion" and doing it for 10 years saves $6 billion.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/24/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-correct-renewing-kids-health-program-/	As a federal government shutdown loomed, lawmakers discussed whether to fold the reauthorization of a popular children’s health plan into a final legislative bargain. At her weekly press conference, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., made the case for reauthorizing the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, for as long as possible. CHIP provides health coverage to certain low-income children and pregnant women whose family income levels are above the threshold to obtain Medicaid coverage. It is funded jointly by the federal government and the states. In 2016, CHIP served 8.9 million beneficiaries. The reauthorization "should have been done in September, first of all," Pelosi said in her Jan. 18, 2018. "Second of all, we wanted 10 years … which, by the way, saves $6 billion." Republicans, she added, rejected a 10-year reauthorization. "Doing it for six years saves $1 billion. That's good," she said. "Doing it 10 years, saving $6 billion is better. In fact, it's best." A few days later, after government funding had lapsed, lawmakers decided to include a six-year CHIP reauthorization in the bill that reopened the government. We were struck by Pelosi’s claim that a federal program to provide health coverage for 8.9 million children and pregnant women could actually save the government money, rather than costing it. So we took a closer look. When we contacted Pelosi’s staff, they pointed us to a Congressional Budget Office analysis of the pending reauthorization bill that had been released the previous day, Jan. 17. CBO is Congress’ nonpartisan arbiter of projected costs of legislation. CBO said that a six-year CHIP reauthorization would produce an additional $8.204 billion in revenue, but only $7.223 billion in additional costs. That means a cumulative savings of $981 million, or nearly $1 billion. (It’s in the chart on page 4 here.) As for a 10-year reauthorization, Pelosi’s office pointed us to a Jan. 11, 2018, CBO analysis. The report projected a 10-year reauthorization "would decrease the deficit by $6 billion over the 2018-2027 period." So Pelosi was correct on the numbers. The broader question: Why does CHIP save the government money? In short, it’s because the alternatives cost more. According to CBO, "extending funding for CHIP for 10 years yields net savings to the federal government because the federal costs of the alternatives to providing coverage through CHIP (primarily Medicaid, subsidized coverage in the marketplaces, and employment-based insurance) are larger than the costs of providing coverage through CHIP during that period." "It’s a very popular program across party lines, and the CBO score had it saving money," said Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who studies health care policy. Our ruling Pelosi said that reauthorizing the Children’s Health Insurance Program "for six years saves $1 billion" and that doing it for 10 years saves $6 billion. CBO analyses back up Pelosi’s numbers. Because the reauthorization of CHIP would essentially take the place of more expensive programs, doing so would eventually net savings for the government.

pomt-05904	"United States of America is twenty-sixth in school performance in the world."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/feb/03/jim-whelan/united-states-ranks-26th-school-performance-world-/	New Jersey students may perform better than their counterparts in many other states, but from a global perspective, students across the United States are falling behind. State Sen. Jim Whelan (D-Atlantic) raised that point during a Jan. 9 debate on the Senate floor about the Urban Hope Act. That legislation, passed by the Legislature and quickly signed into law by Gov. Chris Christie, allows nonprofit entities to build and run schools in three failing districts. Before casting his vote in favor of the bill, Whelan told his fellow legislators that "we’ve got to change the conversation" and consider a longer school year. "Let’s look where we are in the world. We’re twenty-sixth," said Whelan, a teacher in Atlantic City. "United States of America is twenty-sixth in school performance in the world." PolitiFact New Jersey found the numbers that back up Whelan’s statistic, but due to the margins of error attached to the average test scores, the 26th ranking may not be completely accurate. Let’s explain the test we’re talking about. The test -- known as the Programme for International Student Assessment, or PISA -- is overseen by the Paris, France-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The test assesses 15- and 16-year-olds for reading, math and science. The PISA was administered in 65 countries or economies in 2009, and another 10 participants in 2010. Of those 75 participants, the United States ranks 26 when the mean scores in the three subject areas are averaged out. Anthony Jackson, vice president for education at Asia Society, a global educational organization, said in an email that such a composite ranking gives a "broader sense of how student performance in the US (or any nation) compares with that of other nations beyond its performance in any one subject area." Andreas Schleicher, head of the OECD's Indicators and Analysis Division in the Directorate for Education, told us averaging the scores is acceptable, but he cautioned: "I would still not call this ‘overall performance’ since there are a number of school subjects not measured by PISA (e.g. history, geography or music)." But rankings may not be as clear-cut when factoring in the margins of error attached to the average scores. Those margins of error make it difficult to rank countries for both the individual subject areas as well as the composite averages, according to Dana Kelly, co-national project manager of PISA in the United States. "It may appear that the U.S. average is lower (or higher) than another country when actually there is not a measurable difference in the average scores," Kelly said in an email. "Likewise, countries ‘above’ us may not have measurably different average scores from each other so (it) gets even more difficult to figure out where we are in a ranking." "We understand that people want to know where the US stands, but ranking is just tricky," Kelly added. Beth Schroeder, Whelan’s chief of staff, defended the senator in an email: "The point Senator Whelan was trying to make still stands. By any measure, the United States is lagging behind the rest of the world in school performance. Whether we’re 26th or some other rank once you factor in the margin of error, we should be striving to have the best educational system in the world, and shouldn’t settle for anything but first." Our ruling During a debate on the Senate floor, Whelan claimed the "United States of America is twenty-sixth in school performance in the world." Based on the most recent international assessments, the senator’s statistic is on target. After averaging out the mean scores in reading, math and science, the United States ranks 26 out of 75 participating countries or economies. But since those mean scores are subject to margins of error -- which could alter the rankings -- we rate the statement Mostly True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-13764	Says Hillary Clinton "wants to essentially abolish the Second Amendment."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/21/donald-trump/despite-new-adverb-trumps-claim-about-clinton-want/	In officially accepting the GOP presidential nomination, Donald Trump tried to finesse one of his favorite but false attacks on the campaign trail: "My opponent wants to essentially abolish the Second Amendment," Trump said July 21 in Cleveland. It’s nice that Trump added the word "essentially," but the charge is still not without faults. When we last looked at the claim, we found no evidence that Clinton has ever said she wants to repeal or abolish the Second Amendment. She has called for stronger regulations, but continuously affirms her support for the right to bear arms. However, gun rights advocates argue that it’s reasonable to infer from a few comments that she wants to roll back the Second Amendment as it’s currently interpreted. Straight shooting on the campaign trail In both her 2008 and 2016 White House bids, Clinton has called for more gun control all the while saying she "believes in the Second Amendment." Here are a few examples of comments she’s made: • January 2008, Democratic presidential debate: "I believe in the Second Amendment. People have a right to bear arms. But I also believe that we can common-sensically approach this." • August 2015, in response to the on-air murders of a news crew in Virginia: "We are smart enough, compassionate enough to balance legitimate Second Amendment rights concerns with preventive measures and control measures, so whatever motivated this murderer ... we will not see more needless, senseless deaths." • January 2016, on Twitter: "Nobody's attacking the Second Amendment. We can protect Americans' rights — and also protect families from gun violence. #GOPdebate" • June 2016, on ABC’s This Week: "I believe we can have common-sense gun-safety measures consistent with the Second Amendment." (More on this later.) Setting aside the bulk of Clinton’s comments on protecting the Second Amendment (examples here, here, here, here, here and here), we’ll now go over three points that some gun rights advocates and experts say gives Trump’s charge some credence. Smoking guns? Clinton riled the gun lobby with two eyebrow-raising comments last fall and one from this spring. Clinton said in October 2015 a national gun buyback program like Australia’s compulsory program was "worth looking into." After a gunman killed 35 people in Port Arthur, Tasmania, in 1996, Australia banned semiautomatic and automatic weapons and enacted a mandatory buyback of the newly prohibited guns. That program is "incompatible with private ownership of guns," Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, told us in May. (The National Rifle Association shares this view.) The full context of Clinton’s response, however, suggests she may have misspoken or not fully understood Australia’s program, as she also evoked voluntary buybacks as potential models for a U.S. program. Second, Clinton said in a leaked recording of a private fundraiser that she thinks the Supreme Court "is wrong on the Second Amendment," referring to its landmark ruling in District of Columbia vs. Heller. In a 5-4 decision, the Court struck down Washington’s handgun ban and recognized that the Second Amendment applies to the individual’s right to bear arms. Experts who support gun rights told us undoing Heller basically ends the Second Amendment as currently interpreted. They pointed out that former Justice Department officials under President Bill Clinton and his appointees Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg argued in Heller that gun regulations do not violate the Second Amendment because it primarily pertains to a well-regulated militia, not the individual right to bear arms. Clinton, in her June interview on This Week, added fuel to the fire when she appeared to talk about the individual right as a hypothetical. "Do you believe that their conclusion that an individual's right to bear arms is a constitutional right?" host George Stephanopoulos asked. "If it is a constitutional right, then it, like every other constitutional right, is subject to reasonable regulation," she responded. "And what people have done with (the Heller) decision is to take it as far as they possibly can and reject what has been our history from the very beginning of the republic, where some of the earliest laws that were passed were about firearms." The NRA and voices on the right seized upon these comments as proof that Clinton doesn’t really believe in the individual right to bear arms. But that ignores what she said immediately after: "So I think it's important to recognize that reasonable people can say, as I do, responsible gun owners have a right — I have no objection to that. But the rest of the American public has a right to require certain kinds of regularity, responsible actions to protect everyone else." UCLA Second Amendment expert Adam Winkler, meanwhile, said that the accuracy of Trump’s charge depends on Clinton’s grounds for rejecting Heller. (According to news reports from the 2008 election, she supported Washington’s handgun ban.) "If she thought the reasoning was wrong, but the result right, then she would fit in with a number of strong pro-gun advocates," he said. "If, however, she thought there should be no protection for gun rights, then Trump's claim comes closer to the truth." The Clinton campaign previously told us Clinton "believes Heller was wrongly decided in that cities and states should have the power to craft common sense laws to keep their residents safe." This suggests Clinton disagrees with the court declaring the district’s ban on handguns unconstitutional, not necessarily the individual right itself — a position that’s more or less in line with the George W. Bush administration’s position on Heller of recognizing the right but allowing reasonable curtailment. Our ruling Trump said, "My opponent wants to essentially abolish the Second Amendment." The addition of the word essentially doesn’t change the accuracy of this claim. We found no evidence of Clinton ever saying verbatim or suggesting explicitly she wants to abolish the Second Amendment. The bulk of her comments suggest the opposite: She wants to enact stricter gun control, but has no objection to responsible gun ownership. Gun advocates say Trump’s claim is backed up by Clinton’s openness to a gun buyback program and her disagreement with a Supreme Court decision on the Second Amendment. But whether or not these cherry-picked comments actually reveal Clinton’s intentions is a matter of interpretation. We rate Trump’s claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/85ef6fa9-d3d9-4a5f-afd2-40af77b1eb94	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-07-21T23:23:50	2016-07-21	['None']
pomt-13219	The stories from women saying he groped or forced himself on them "largely have been debunked."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/20/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-reports-sexual-assault-him-have-/	Republican nominee Donald Trump said at the third and final presidential debate that allegations from nine women that he groped or kissed them without their consent have been debunked. "Nobody has more respect for women than I do — nobody," Trump said. "And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked." Have they? We decided to look into Trump’s claim. What we found is that while some accounts have been challenged, none have been shown to be untrue by any objective measure. We’ll discuss the situation surrounding each accuser. Jessica Leeds Leeds told the New York Times that in the 1980s, Trump groped her during an airplane flight to New York. According to the New York Times, Leeds "told the story to at least four people close to her, who also spoke with The New York Times." The Trump campaign offered a contrary account from a man who said he was on that flight. Anthony Gilberthorpe told the New York Post that Leeds was the one who was being flirtatious and that he saw nothing inappropriate. Gilberthorpe has a checkered past involving his revelation that he procured young boys for high-ranking British politicians, but more importantly, he told the Post he has no evidence to support his story. Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson challenged Leeds’ story on the grounds that the airplane Pierson said Leeds flew in didn’t have armrests as Leed’s described. No one knows what sort of plane Leeds was in. For the most part, it’s word against word. Mindy McGillivray McGillivray told the Palm Beach Post that in 2003, Trump grabbed her behind at a Mar-a-Lago concert. McGillivray was assisting photographer Ken Davidoff. Davidoff told the Post reporter he "vividly remembers when McGillivray pulled him aside moments after the alleged incident and told him, ‘Donald just grabbed my ass!’ " The counter information comes from the conservative website thegatewaypundit, which claims that there was no concert on the day Davidoff said. But the website asserts that without proof. Even if the photographer got the date wrong, and there’s no proof that he did, that doesn’t debunk the allegation. Natasha Stoynoff Stoynoff wrote in People magazine that during a pause in a 2005 interview with Trump and his wife Melania, Trump and she were alone in a room briefly where he forcibly kissed her. She told a co-worker, friends and family soon after the event happened but did not include it in her article. The counter information comes from Trump’s former butler Anthony Senecal who told the Palm Beach Post that "it never happened." Melania Trump also disputes later meeting Stoynoff on the street as Stoynoff said. Again, we have the confirmation of Stoynoff’s friends, and at most, it’s her word against Senecal’s. Summer Zervos Zervos was a former contestant on Trump’s reality show The Apprentice. She said she went to Trump’s golf course in Palos Verdes, Calif., in 2007 to apply for a job and Trump forcibly kissed her and groped her. In a news conference, a social worker said that Zervos told her about the encounter in 2010, years before Trump announced his presidential bid. Trump posted on Facebook that he never met Zervos at a hotel and that she stayed in touch with him. Trump wrote that as recently as April this year, she invited him to come to her restaurant in California. Also, Zervos’cousin said she only had good things to say about Trump. Trump’s account raises questions about Zervos’ contact with him, but it does not rebut her claim. Claims from other women There are five other women who say that Trump groped or kissed them without their consent. They are Cassandra Searles, Rachel Crooks, Kristen Anderson, Jill Harth and Temple Taggert McDowell. We found no evidence to undermine their claims other than Trump’s own denials. We asked the Trump campaign to send us details that would disprove the women’s accounts and did not hear back. Our ruling Trump said that the stories of him groping or forcing himself on women "have been largely debunked." His campaign offered no evidence of that. We found that five of the nine stories have not been independently disputed. Of the remaining four stories, the women told friends, family or colleagues at the time, which provides some support. On the flip side, there is the account of Trump’s former butler and a man who acknowledges that he has no proof of his version of events. While some of the women’s stories have been questioned, not one has been conclusively debunked, and the majority of the stories haven’t been challenged by any facts other than Trump’s denials. We rate this claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/fa622a1b-1c53-4b62-b3ec-629c8a468bc5	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-10-20T01:48:46	2016-10-19	['None']
pomt-08525	Ron Klein "sponsored an amendment that specifically allows price gouging."	false	/florida/statements/2010/oct/05/we-love-usa-pac/pac-claims-kleins-amendment-would-allow-price-goug/	A political action committee entered the fray between U.S. Rep. Ron Klein, D-Boca Raton, and his Republican challenger Allen West. The "We Love USA" PAC is not in love with Klein -- the group's website features an image of Klein dangling from puppet strings being directed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The entrance of a PAC isn't surprising in this big-money District 22 battleground in South Florida. When we first spotted the website on Sept. 24, 2010, it had a video posted called "Klein passing gas." A few days later we found the same video on YouTube though the date was June 18, 2008 -- during Klein's previous re-election bid when he also faced West. The 1-minute, 16-second video focuses on gasoline prices. Near the start, text on the screen states, "While the prices at the pump are skyrocketing, Ron Klein speaks strong..." The video shows an undated clip of him apparently speaking on the House floor about giving the Federal Trade Commission "the authority to crack down on the people who price gouge." Then the text says "But Klein lies! ... Ron Klein sponsored an amendment that specifically allows price gouging." We wanted to know, did Klein sponsor an amendment related to gas prices that "specifically allows price gouging"? In South Florida, with limited public transportation options, residents rely heavily on cars -- so gas prices matter to many voters. And in a region prone to gas shortages caused by hurricanes, we're sensitive to the issue of gouging. The video mixes narration, text and photos. The images show a gas station with prices as high as $5.199 a gallon and a blurry image of Klein in front of another station. The text cites an amendment to H.R. 3355 offered by Klein on Nov. 8, 2007, and claims it was "to modify the instruction prohibiting price gouging by replacing it with language discouraging price gouging, thereby legalizing price gouging." It continues: "Middle-class families and their increasingly tight budgets need relief. Not more lies and broken promises. Floridians are paying twice as much at the gas pump as when Ron Klein came to office in 2006... Every time we pump gas into our car or truck, we should remember that Ron Klein allows price gouging!" In the background, Gwen Stefani's sultry voice can be heard singing the hit single "Don't Speak" by No Doubt. First, some background -- and we could find little -- about We Love USA. The group's website states that the PAC was set up on Sept. 23, 2010, and that "Our core mission is simple; showing the voters how the candidates have voted during the Obama administration. Those in Congress who voted with Pelosi on every single important bill are trying to hide their record thru negative attacks and denial of their near unanimous voting with her. We will do our best to not let the voters forget where these politicians stand on the issues." FEC reports show that the PAC filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission Sept. 21 and lists Nancy Watkins, of the accounting firm Robert Watkins and Company in Tampa, as the treasurer. The PAC filed an FEC report Sept. 28 showing it had spent $62,652 on advertising. In an interview with the Miami Herald editorial board Sept. 27, both West and Klein said that they had nothing to do with the PAC. The PAC responded to e-mails about the gas video but not about the PAC itself. Nor did anyone return phone calls. About three hours after our first e-mail Sept. 27 asking about the gas video, the PAC responded that it had taken down the video. "Thank you for bringing to our attention that we should provide links to fact check our videos and statements we place on this website,'' said the e-mail signed "Media Relations." "We have pulled the video 'Ron Klein Pass Gas' as it stated that Ron Klein came to office in 2006. In 2006, Ron Klein became Congressman-Elect, and officially took office in January 2007. Because of this oversight, we have decided to take the video off of the website." But the PAC still stood behind the claim about price gouging, and Mark Laffler of We Love USA e-mailed us the amendments cited in the ad. Let's look at H.R. 3355. The bill, sponsored by Klein in 2007, was called the "Homeowners Defense Act of 2007." The bill was to provide federal support for state-sponsored insurance programs to help homeowners facing natural catastrophes such as hurricanes. On Nov. 8, 2007, U.S. Rep. Ginny Brown-Waite, a Republican who represents west-central Florida, introduced an amendment to "prohibit price gouging in any disaster area located within the State." The amendment defines price gouging as: "providing of any consumer good or service by a supplier related to repair or restoration of property damaged from a catastrophe for a price that the supplier knows or has reason to know is greater, by at least the percentage set forth in a State law or regulation prohibiting such act (not withstanding any real cost increase due to any attendant business risk and other reasonable expenses that result from the major catastrophe involved), than the price charged by the supplier for such consumer good or service immediately before the disaster." Klein responded with his own amendment to strike "prohibit" and insert "discourage." He wanted to soften that price-gouging language because he didn't want to set up a barrier to many states joining the national disaster consortium. The overall bill passed the House, 258-155, on Nov. 8, 2007, but stalled in the Senate. The Homeowners Defense Act of 2010, H.R. 2555, sponsored by Klein is pending. That doesn’t make Klein soft on gasoline price gouging though. We found three laws he voted for that were specifically aimed at prohibiting gas price gouging or limiting gas prices: • Klein was one of 125 co-sponsors and voted for the "Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act" H.R. 1252 in 2007. It would have made it illegal during an emergency to sell gas at an excessive price. That bill stalled in a Senate committee. A related bill, H.R. 6346 the Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act in 2008, failed to become law though Klein did vote for it. • Klein voted for the Gas Price Relief for Consumers Act of 2008 H.R. 6074, which would have made it illegal for foreign states to act together to limit the production of gas or set the price. The related Senate bill S. 879 had hearings but no vote. • Klein voted for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Fill Suspension and Consumer Protection Act of 2008 H.R. 6022. It passed and "directs the Secretary of the Interior to suspend petroleum acquisition for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve through the royalty-in-kind program" through the end of 2008. Pelosi called for the move to bring down gas prices. This bill was signed into law by President George W. Bush on May 19, 2008. We also wanted to check the ad's claim that gas prices doubled during Klein's tenure in Congress. The PAC, in an e-mail, wrote that the price of gas doubled in 2008 and sent us a link to GasBuddy for historical gas prices in Miami -- which is outside of Klein's Congressional district. We contacted AAA and asked for gas prices for January 2006, January 2007 and the most recent month available in 2010 for Fort Lauderdale -- part of the city lies within the district. AAA’s chart showed a gallon of unleaded gas cost $2.3855 in January 2006, $2.3074 in January 2007, and $2.7175 in September 2010. AAA figures show the average price rose to more than $4 in 2008 in Fort Lauderdale, though the peak was still more than 50 cents short of doubling from the start of Klein’s term. Let's review: the We Love USA PAC had a video on its website that stated "Klein sponsored an amendment that specifically allows price gouging." Klein's amendment was to change the wording from "prohibit" price gouging to "discourage." The PAC interprets "discourage" to mean "specifically allows," which is a stretch. Further, the video suggests to the viewer that the amendment was about gas prices -- but the bill was about homeowners insurance and property damage. We rate this claim False.

pomt-06156	Says Texas did not bail out a loan program he oversaw as state agriculture commissioner.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2011/dec/18/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-loan-program-he-oversaw-wasnt-bail/	In the Dec. 15, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Iowa, Texas Gov. Rick Perry was asked to account for a loan program he oversaw as the state’s agriculture commissioner, the elected post he held from 1991 through 1998. Neil Cavuto of Fox News noted that Perry wants Congress to stop spending so much. "But as Texas agriculture commissioner, you oversaw a loan guarantee program that, as the Austin American-Statesman reported at the time, had so many defaults that the state had to stop guaranteeing bank loans to start-ups in the agribusiness, and eventually bailed out the program with the taxpayer money," Cavuto said. "So aren't you guilty of the same behavior you rail against as a presidential candidate?" Perry replied: "Number one, don't believe everything you read in the Austin American-Statesman. And the second side of it is, we had that program put in place, and the state did not bail (it) out; those programs worked as they were supposed to work. Just like in any bank or any business, you are going to have some that fail." No bailout? As agriculture commissioner, Perry oversaw the Texas Agricultural Finance Authority, which was created in 1987. The authority was launched to boost the agricultural economy by selling state-backed bonds to guarantee bank loans to entrepreneurs who could not get commercial loans. The goal was to create small businesses and jobs by processing — rather than simply growing — Texas agricultural products. A revamped version continues today. The authority’s Agricultural Loan Guarantee program provides loan guarantees to lenders for eligible applicants who wish to establish or enhance their farm and/or ranch operation or an agriculture-related business. According to the Texas Department of Agriculture, applicants may seek a loan of any amount from their local lender, but the guarantee may not exceed $750,000 or 70 percent of the loan amount, whichever is less. Other offerings include a young farmer grant and interest-rate reduction programs. From 1997 through 1999, the Texas state auditor alerted officials to problems in the program, with the problems growing each successive year. Responding to the first hint of problems, Perry said the program was positioned to thrive. In a Jan. 15, 1998, guest column in the Amarillo Daily News, Perry said the program was "on solid footing with a positive balance projected by 2010." He noted too that the loans were funded by debt — commercial paper: "No taxpayer money has ever been used to make TAFA loans." In May 1999, though, the auditor’s office warned that if the program’s loan-guarantee program did "not improve its financial position, appropriations may be required in the future to meet its general obligation debt." The auditor said the loan-guarantee program had a "negative fund equity" of $6.9 million through August 1998 because 22 of 83 loans had defaulted since 1993. "An additional $4.5 million, associated with loans currently in default, may have to be written off," the auditor said. "Because it provides loans that otherwise would not be made, the authority has had difficulty attracting good loans to act as a buffer against its riskier loans," the auditor said. "A certain volume of good loans is needed to ensure that losses are offset and that the programs are self-sustaining; however, the authority has not yet developed financial projections to identify that volume." As bad debt accumulated, the agency in 2002 put a moratorium on new loans in five of eight TAFA programs. As of the end of August 2008, the agency later reported, TAFA had $25 million in outstanding debt with only $6.4 million in loans and $4.1 million in cash available to service the debt. In 2009, the agency asked the Texas Legislature to pay off the loan guarantees with a $14.7 million appropriation. An April 24, 2009, Statesman news article says the authority’s bad loans had been pronounced uncollectable. At the time, Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples told the newspaper in an interview that the authority had distributed about $82 million in loans through the program’s suspension in 2002. Some loans worked out, Staples said, and a study showed the program had created jobs, but Staples acknowledged that the $14.7 million in defaults -- about 18 percent of the total amount lent -- represented a dismal track record. "It's bad," Staples said. "Unfortunately, taxpayers are on the hook for something that happened as long ago as 1987." According to records, the authority’s first bad loans were written off in August 1995. Twenty-nine of 102 guaranteed loans defaulted, almost all of them during Perry's tenure, according to the records, which were provided to the Statesman by the agriculture department. As governor, Perry signed the program’s infusion of aid into law by approving the 2010-11 state budget sent to him by lawmakers. A provision specifies that $14.7 million is appropriated to "retire the debt of the Texas Agricultural Finance Authority," which was restructured by a separate measure. We asked Perry’s campaign about his no-bailout debate statement and didn’t hear back. Asked to describe the 2009 spending, Bryan Black, a spokesman for the agriculture department, called the action a "one-time state appropriation to pay off the debt." Our sense? Taxpayers picked up built-up costs that otherwise could not be covered. It seems reasonable to call that expenditure a bailout. Further, Perry’s contention there was no bailout runs counter to his signing the spending into law -- making his debate claim ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-12827	Says Melania Trump’s security detail at Trump Tower costs more than the annual budget for the National Endowment for the Arts.	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2017/feb/08/social-media/does-melania-trumps-security-detail-cost-more-fede/	Grumbling about the first family’s taxpayer-funded trips and expenses is a time-honored political tradition, no matter the party of the president. Former President Ronald Reagan's two-week stay in Santa Barbara, Calif., ran up a Air Force One tab of at least $250,000 in 1981. President Barack Obama’s golf getaways were the subject of constant conservative consternation. Enter President Donald Trump, the tweeter in chief. People are turning to Trump’s favorite social medium to complain about tax dollars spent protecting first lady Melania Trump and son Barron, who still live in Trump Tower in New York. One common comparison we’ve seen says that Melania Trump’s security detail at Trump Tower costs more than the annual budget for the National Endowment for the Arts, which the administration reportedly has considered eliminating altogether. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com We wanted to know how the argument held up. Problem is, there’s no good number for how much Melania Trump’s New York security detail costs. We’ll start with what we know: The National Endowment for the Arts’ budget was a little under $148 million for fiscal year 2016, and it’s requested a budget of about $150 million for fiscal year 2017, according to its website. To top the 2016 amount, Melania and Barron would need to stay at Trump Tower for an entire year with a detail costing more than $405,000 a day. To beat the 2017 budget request, the security costs would need to exceed $410,000 a day. During the transition period, the city took on most of the cost of protecting the Trumps in New York. A spokesperson for New York mayor Bill de Blasio told us Donald, Melania and Barron Trump ran up a $37 million bill for security from Election Day to the inauguration Jan. 20. (De Blasio has requested the federal government reimburse his city for security costs, and Congress has doled about $7 million.) In comparison, the city of Chicago spent at least $2.2 million to protect Obama’s home in Chicago from his election in November 2008 to his inauguration in January 2009, the Chicago Tribune reported. CBS’ New York affiliate reported, based on anonymous sources, that the city spends $500,000 a day to protect Trump Tower when the president is there, but less when it’s just Melania and Barron. That figure, de Blasio spokesperson Freddi Goldstein said, likely refers to the daily cost of security ($37 million divided by 74 days). But the mayor’s office has yet to complete an estimate for the cost of the first lady and Barron’s security detail alone, and believes it’ll be less than $500,000 a day. Goldstein told us even if the president were visiting New York, the price tag would likely be less today as much of the activity outside Trump Tower has dissipated since the first months of his election. Trump told reporters in November that his wife and youngest son would join him at the White House "very soon, after he’s finished with school," which indicate a mid-year move. The White House said this month that Melania Trump will move to the White House at the end of the school year and split time between New York and Washington. Our ruling Social media posts say Melania Trump’s security detail at Trump Tower costs more than the annual budget for the National Endowment for the Arts. That’s a flawed projection based on incomplete data. It assumes that Melania and Barron Trump will stay at Trump Tower the entire year, racking up a security bill of more than $410,000 a day, every day. But officials say the Melania Trump and her son intend to move to the White House at the end of the school year and split time between Washington and New York. What the first family will actually do we don’t know. But neither do bloggers. They should back off this claim until there is more data. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-11044	Says he "actually wrote the bipartisan law that makes it illegal to drill off Florida’s coast."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2018/jun/29/bill-nelson/did-bill-nelson-write-bipartisan-law-makes-it-ille/	A new ad in Florida’s hotly contested Senate race portrays a clear distinction between Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson and Republican opponent Gov. Rick Scott when it comes to their record on offshore oil drilling. The ad accuses the term-limited governor of supporting offshore drilling even after the BP oil spill and claims that Scott’s January meeting about drilling with Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke was nothing more than a "political stunt." Then the ad by Nelson shifts to his record. "Bill Nelson actually wrote the bipartisan law that makes it illegal to drill off Florida’s coast," the text on the screen says. We’ve already taken a close look at Scott’s record on oil drilling when we gave him Full Flop in January. We found that Scott clearly campaigned in 2010 on expanding oil drilling. But that changed around the time of the meeting with Zinke. This time, we wanted to hone in on Nelson’s legislative record. Did Nelson actually write the law that makes it illegal to drill off Florida’s coast? Environmental experts said Nelson deserves credit for protecting Florida’s Gulf Coast, but the legislation that actually was signed into law didn’t have Nelson’s name on it. Still, based on news reporting at that time, it was clear that Nelson’s bill (and the Republican who co-sponsored it) was the inspiration for the law that enacted a moratorium on drilling on the Gulf Coast. The evidence In 2006, Nelson teamed up with former Florida Republican Sen. Mel Martinez to cosponsor a piece of legislation known as the Permanent Protection for Florida Act of 2006 (S.2239). That bill aimed to prohibit offshore drilling on the outer Continental Shelf near Florida. Specifically, the bill put a moratorium on issuing a lease for the exploration, development, or production of oil, natural gas, or any other mineral off much of the coast of Florida until June 30, 2020. Frank Jackalone, the director of Florida chapter of the Sierra Club, praised Nelson and Martinez when the bill was introduced. (The Sierra Club endorsed Nelson). "Last week our Florida senators introduced legislation that would head off these threats by providing permanent protection for Florida’s coasts and extended protection for the remaining moratoria areas," Jackalone said in a speech he gave at the time "... He and Senator Nelson have given us a wonderful example of bipartisan leadership that puts Florida’s economy and environment first." That bill was introduced in the Senate but did not get a hearing and never made it to law. So can Nelson really take credit for signing the bipartisan law that makes it illegal to drill off Florida’s coast? Although Nelson and Martinez’s legislation was not signed into law, similar ideas were included in a section of another bill known as the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (S.3711), which was sponsored by former Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M. That bill enacted a moratorium on drilling within 230 miles of Tampa Bay and 125 miles from the Panhandle until June 2022, among other things. It was signed into law Dec. 20, 2006. The bill didn’t have Nelson’s name on it, but each bill aimed to protect Florida’s Gulf Coast for oil drilling by placing a moratorium on issuing a lease for the exploration, development, or production of oil, natural gas, or any other mineral. Alyson Flournoy, a law professor at the University of Florida, said that if the language of Nelson’s bill was included in the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006, we would treat Nelson as the author of that part of the law. Taking a closer look at the text We compared the text of Nelson and Martinez’s bill with the text from the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 to get a better look at the similarities between the two measures. The language in the 2006 Energy Act is not a carbon copy of Nelson’s bill, but conveys very similar ideas, especially about where drilling would be prohibited. For example, Nelson and Martinez’s bill defined the area off limits as the Florida exclusion zone. That area included: 25 miles west of the Military Mission Line, 150 miles off the Florida Panhandle, including the area commonly known as the "Stovepipe’" in the Gulf of Mexico, and 150 miles off the Florida east coast. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 enacted the moratorium on any area east of the Military Mission Line in the Gulf of Mexico; any area in the Eastern Planning Area that is within 125 miles of the coastline of the State of Florida and part of the Central Planning Area that is in middle of the Gulf of Mexico. So, Nelson’s bill isn’t the exact same language, but newspaper outlets at the time said that Nelson and Martinez worked together to make sure the Gulf of Mexico was protected from oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006. "Florida's U.S. senators, Democrat Bill Nelson and Republican Mel Martinez, had helped craft the bill, and both voted for it this morning," the St. Petersburg Times wrote in 2006. "Martinez, who negotiated the measure with input from Nelson, rebuffed suggestions that the delegation could successfully maintain its 'no drilling' stance," the Miami Herald wrote after the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act passed the House. Days before the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 was signed in to law. Martinez attended a press conference to speak about it. "Nelson and I, both from Florida, have had longstanding concerns about protections we felt were necessary for Florida's fragile environment and also because of our very strong economies derived from tourism, that our coastal waters and beaches be protected," Martinez said. "For that reason, the features of this bill that are attractive to us is the zone of protection that it creates for Florida along the Gulf Coast while at the same time permitting this very important additional exploration to take place." Environmental experts agreed that Nelson deserves credit for writing the bipartisan law that makes it illegal to drill off Florida’s Gulf coast. "Nelson out of anybody has the right to brag about being the gatekeeper on the Eastern Gulf," said Julie Wraithmell, the executive director of Audubon Florida. "If it wasn’t for him, we really would have struggled." Our ruling A campaign ad paid for by Nelson said he "actually wrote the bipartisan law that makes it illegal to drill off Florida’s coast." The ad writers should be more careful with their language. Nelson co-sponsored legislation in 2006 that would have banned drilling off Florida’s coast. That measure was never signed in to law, but similar ideas were included in the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006, which, among other things, enacted a moratorium on drilling 125 miles of the eastern portion of the Gulf of Mexico until June 2022. According to news reports at that time, Nelson and Martinez negotiated and worked to make sure Florida’s Gulf Coast was protected under with the 2006 act. And even though the law was not an exact copy, environmental experts agreed that Nelson deserves credit for writing the bipartisan law that makes it illegal to drill off Florida’s Gulf coast.

pomt-06810	"We're inches away from no longer having a free economy."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/12/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-gets-another-pants-fire-saying-were-in/	During the Republican presidential debate in Ames, Iowa, on Aug. 11, 2011, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney revived a line he first used in his June 2, 2011, presidential announcement at a farm in Stratham, N.H. Decrying the growth of government as a share of the economy, Romney said in Ames, "We're inches away from no longer having a free economy." We gave Romney a Pants on Fire when he first used the line -- when his exact wording was, "We are only inches away from ceasing to be a free market economy" -- and we see no reason to change that ruling. Separately we'll be checking the lead-in to this comment that Romney used in Ames -- that "back in the days of John F. Kennedy, the federal government took up, along with the state and local governments, 27 percent of the economy. Today, government consumes 37 percent of the economy." But here, we’ll recap our analysis of his claim that "we’re inches away from no longer having a free economy." As we indicated in June, we at PolitiFact tolerate a bit of hyperbole from politicians on all sides when they’re trying to make a point. So we’re not literally using a ruler to measure distances here. However, we decided that the underlying question -- whether the United States could really be approaching socialism -- is a fair one to analyze. Here are some of the statistics to consider: Government spending. On the suggestion of several economists, we took the figures for government expenditures (which includes all levels of government) and divided them by the national gross domestic product for the years 1996 through 2010. For more than a decade, government spending as a percentage of GDP was quite stable, bouncing between 30.4 percent and 32.9 percent. For the last few years, that percentage has indeed gone up -- to roughly 38 percent in both 2009 and 2010, which is within striking distance of the 40 percent Romney cited. Bruce Bartlett, a former official in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, said that Romney is "implying that the temporary increase in spending from (Obama’s stimulus bill) and the consequences of the recession are permanent," Bartlett said. Other economists noted that government’s footprint in GDP started growing in 2008 -- under Bush, not Obama -- because that’s when the recession began to hit. And even if the government share of GDP is close to 40 percent, would that be a catastrophe for economic freedom? Most of the experts we spoke to scoffed at the suggestion. "It has long been the conservative view that there is only so much freedom out there and if government grows in size then this necessarily diminishes freedom," Bartlett said. "Thus if spending is 25 percent of GDP, then we are three-quarters free, and if it grows to 40 percent, then we have lost 15 percent of our freedom and are only 60 percent free. This, of course, is nonsense, because it implies that the greatest freedom exists in anarchy … and that freedom is the only thing anyone cares about." Here are a few other statistics to consider. Taxes. Taxes offer another measure of government involvement into the economy. According to the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that studies tax policy, the total federal, state and local tax burden has been falling -- not rising -- in recent years. Every year, the group computes a national figure for all levels of taxation as a share of national income. The data shows that the tax burden has fallen modestly in recent years, from 31.2 percent in 2006 to 27.2 percent in 2011. And as we concluded in a separate fact-check, the U.S. tax burden isn’t just hovering around a historical low -- it’s also low compared to other advanced industrialized nations. In a 2006 international comparison, 25 nations had a higher percentage of taxes compared to GDP than the U.S., while just four -- Mexico, Japan, Korea and Turkey -- had a lower percentage. Regulation. "One loses being a free market economy not so much, or not solely, because of the level of spending and taxation, but also by the level and reach of government regulation, and by the distortions to choices that arise through government policy -- think of tax rules that discourage some behaviors and investments in favor of others," said J.D. Foster, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation. Tevi Troy, a senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute, said that bailouts for Wall Street and U.S. automakers (approved under Bush and continued under Obama) and the increasing government oversight over the health care sector (approved under Obama) represent nearly unprecedented willingness by the government to intervene in the economy. (Supporters, of course, counter that all but the health care intervention were intended to be temporary and came in response to a dire situation.) However, there’s strong evidence undercutting Romney's claim that comes from, of all places, the conservative Heritage Foundation. Heritage published an economic freedom index for 2011 -- an international ranking of nations using a combination of 10 types of statistics, covering business freedom, trade freedom, fiscal freedom, government spending, monetary freedom, investment freedom, financial freedom, property rights, freedom from corruption and labor freedom. Certainly, different groups could measure freedom differently. But let’s look at what Heritage concluded. The U.S. ranked ninth out of 179 nations on the list, with a score that placed it near the top of the "mostly free" category. The only nations to be considered more "free" than the U.S. were, in descending order, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Canada, Ireland, and Denmark. If the results of this study -- which, we’ll remind readers, was produced by a staunchly conservative think tank -- suggest that the U.S. is on the verge of socialism, then Lenin must be partying in his mauseoleum. For the U.S. to fall into the "mostly unfree" category, which is only the third-lowest category in the study, it would have to drop a whopping 83 slots, to a perch below such nations as Albania, Rwanda and Kazakhstan. We did hear one argument that provided a measure of support for Romney’s position -- but only in a backhanded way. Eugene Steuerle, an economist with the Urban Institute, a think tank that does economic and social policy research, said Romney’s comparison is imperfect because over the past century, there really hasn’t been a golden age in which the economy was genuinely unfettered, so the U.S. really couldn't be inching away from such an age. "We’ve been a mixed economy for a long time," Steuerle said. "The ‘free market’ is a somewhat vague term. Technically, a Federal Reserve system and an antitrust division of the Justice Department interfere with a totally free market economy, yet they may promote a competitive economy." So where does this leave us? It’s true that the government’s footprint on spending has grown over the past few years, due in large part to the recession. But while the statistics show that the government continues to have a large influence on the economy, there is little indication that the government’s role has risen dramatically enough over the past few years to threaten the kind of free market that the U.S. has operated under in recent decades. And international comparisons show that the U.S. ranks low in both total tax burden and high in economic freedom -- at least as measured by a prominent conservative think tank. In June, we found this claim ridiculous. In August, we still do. Once again, we rate Romney's statement Pants on Fire.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2011-08-12T11:12:44	2011-08-11	['None']
pomt-11903	"Seventy-three percent of our veterans are graduating from drug courts. By contrast, I think most of the people in the very good drug court program — the graduation rate’s like 53, 55 percent. The point of that is that drug courts are working for veterans."	mostly true	/missouri/statements/2017/oct/21/eric-greitens/greitens-mostly-right-veterans-treatment-court-gra/	In his August Facebook Live video, Gov. Eric Greitens encouraged viewers to submit their questions. One viewer asked, "What do we do for our veterans except use them as our reason to get mad when it fits our agenda?" In response, Greitens touched on providing jobs for veterans, in addition to citing the rate of veterans graduating from treatment courts in Missouri. "Our veterans in our veterans court, are graduating — 73 percent of our veterans are graduating from drug courts," Greitens said. "By contrast, I think most of the people in the very good drug court program — the graduation rate’s like 53, 55 percent. The point of that is that drug courts are working for veterans." We were wondering: Are 73 percent of veterans graduating from treatment courts? While we never heard back from Greitens’ spokesman, a Supreme Court of Missouri spokeswoman pointed us in the direction of where those numbers came from. Treatment courts According to the Missouri Courts website, treatment courts began as a way to battle increasing substance abuse problems. Treatment courts have existed in Missouri for nearly 25 years. The first treatment court was started in 1993 in Jackson County. Legislation in 2013 established the first veterans treatment courts programs, which "are hybrid drug and mental health court dockets that use the treatment court model to serve veterans struggling with addiction, serious mental illness and/or co-occurring disorders," according to a treatment courts fact sheet. As of August 2017, there were 147 treatment court programs throughout the state. Of those, 12 are veterans treatment courts, with the remaining being adult, juvenile, family and DWI courts. Veterans can be accepted into treatment courts for drug-involved offenses and DWI offenses, Beth Riggert, communications counsel for the Supreme Court of Missouri, wrote in an email. The numbers According to the treatment courts fact sheet, "The graduation rate for all programs in fiscal 2017 exceeds 61 percent." However, the most recent data on veterans treatment courts is from calendar year 2016, Riggert said. In that time frame, there were a total of 247 veterans participating in veterans treatment courts in the state, Riggert said. However, because the program is rolling, only a total of 82 veterans exited the program in 2016. Of those, 60 successfully graduated the program and 22 did not. That translates to a success rate of 73.17 percent, or just about what Greitens said. Since 2011, the graduation rate from veterans treatment courts has steadily been increasing as more veterans have gone through the program. Greitens also said, "By contrast, I think most of the people in the very good drug court program — the graduation rate’s like 53, 55 percent." Because we were unable to reach Greitens’ spokesman for comment, we are unsure which specific treatment courts program Greitens was referring to when he said "the very good drug court program." However, Riggert elaborated on the graduation for other treatment court programs. In the same period, the graduation rate from adult drug courts was 52 percent, and the graduation rate from DWI courts was 90 percent, Riggert said. While Greitens is correct that the veterans treatment courts’ graduation rate was higher than some, such as the adult drug court’s rate, it is still not as high as the DWI court’s graduation rate of 90 percent. However, Riggert said it may not be accurate to compare graduation rates between treatment courts to prove one program’s success. "The various types of treatment court programs are distinct, and so it is not helpful to try to make a side-by-side comparison," Riggert said. While 73 percent of veterans exiting the program did graduate in 2016, it is unclear how many veterans who graduate from the program have to return for additional treatment. "Because veterans treatment courts are relatively new, we do not yet have sufficient quantifiable data from which to determine recidivism rates for these programs," Riggert said. Our ruling Greitens said, "73 percent of our veterans are graduating from drug courts. By contrast, I think most of the people in the very good drug court program — the graduation rate’s like 53, 55 percent. The point of that is that drug courts are working for veterans." While the overall numbers are small, Greitens is correct that in 2016, 73 percent of veterans successfully completed treatment court. Over the same time period, the overall graduation rate from adult treatment court was 52 percent, officials say. However, officials also pointed out that the two programs are not identical, which makes comparing them imprecise. In addition, while graduation rate is one measurement of success, it’s not the only one, and as Riggert noted, veteran treatment courts are so new that no data on recidivism rates have been collected. We rate Greitens’ claim Mostly True.	None	Eric Greitens	None	None	None	2017-10-21T11:08:54	2017-08-13	['None']
pomt-08453	Georgia lawmakers balanced the budget without raising taxes on residents.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2010/oct/15/casey-cagle/cagle-budget-claim-gets-scrutiny/	There are some things you just don't do if you want to be considered a conservative politician. Raising taxes is at the top of the list. Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle has proudly told audiences that Georgia leaders, amid one of the worst economic periods in American history, passed a budget this spring without raising taxes. Cagle, a Republican running for re-election, bragged about this at a Sept. 4 GOP rally in Carroll County, giving some of the credit to Gov. Sonny Perdue. "[Perdue] was able to help us balance the budget without raising taxes on the residents of Georgia," Cagle said, according to the Times-Georgian newspaper in Carrollton. Some AJC PolitiFact Georgia readers have questioned the claim in recent weeks and asked us to check it out. Carol Porter, Cagle's Democratic opponent in the Nov. 2 election, cut a television commercial this week calling out her opponent. "Casey Cagle raised our taxes during a recession," a voice says over ominous music. There are three main points of debate about Cagle's statement. The first is centered on House Bill 1055. It is 84 pages of legalese that raises fees on many items. Most are for services not used by the average Georgian, such as the licensing fee for a fertilizer distributor. Some, however, included the annual fee to register a business in Georgia, the cost for a personalized license plate and fees to run a child care business. Combined, the fee increases are estimated to collect an additional $90 million over a year. Some say a fee increase is simply a politician using a different word for a tax increase. Others disagree. It's a longtime argument. Webster's defines a tax as "a charge, usually of money, imposed by an authority on persons or property for public purposes." Webster's says a fee is "a sum paid or charged for a service." University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock considers a fee as the cost for a service people can choose to use or not. He contends a tax is for a service that serves a general purpose, such as public schools or roads. Kelly McCutchen, president of the Georgia Public Policy Foundation, a conservative think tank, defines a fee as a charge that covers the cost of providing a service. He says a tax is when the government collects revenue that is greater than the cost of providing the service. Under those definitions, we're not convinced these fee increases constitute a tax increase. The second area of disagreement concerns a proposal near the bottom of HB 1055. It requires hospitals to give the state 1.45 percent of their net patient revenue, which is estimated to total about $200 million a year. Many fiscal watchdogs called it the "hospital bed tax." The debate about it was "polarizing," recalled Josh Culling of Washington, D.C.-based Americans for Tax Reform. Perdue wanted the bed charge and got into a verbal battle with ATR, which opposed the idea. The earlier version of the bill, which was passed by the Georgia Senate, which Cagle leads, caused such conflict within the GOP that Sen. Preston Smith of Rome said he was ousted as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee over his opposition to the legislation. Smith called it a tax increase. McCutchen and others argue hospitals will pass the cost on to patients, and in this case, the patient is paying more than the cost of the service. Cagle spokesman Ben Fry disagreed. He said the legislation isn't a tax increase because the money is used to collect more money from the federal government to fund the state's Medicaid insurance program for low-income Georgians. Fry also notes the charge is set to expire by July 2013 and the bill includes a provision to gradually eliminate the small state property tax by 2016 and provide tax reductions on retirement income. The Cagle spokesman reminded us of a front-page headline in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that called the legislation a "tax break." Fry also showed us a statement by Americans for Tax Reform, which is best known for its pledge that many politicians eagerly sign during campaign season committing not to support any bill that increases total taxation. "When fully phased in, with the hospital bed tax expiring in three years and the statewide property tax completely eliminated in 2016, HB 1055 represents a net revenue reduction for the state -- and a net tax reduction for Georgia citizens," the ATR statement said. ATR's Culling said of the legislation: "There was a tax increase, but it was offset by the other cuts." Smith told reporters from the AJC and Channel 2 Action News in an April interview that he wasn't sure about the likelihood of those cuts. "The tax increase is certain and it's immediate," the lawmaker said. "The so-called tax decreases that were in the original bill are contingent, they're not certain and they're some point in the future." Still, it seems like a stretch to us to equate the indirect passing along of a hospital surcharge to patients with a tax increase "on residents." The third argument concerns the Homeowner's Tax Relief Grant program. The state program gave Georgia homeowners between $200 and $300 to offset their property taxes, which cost the state about $428 million a year, about 2 percent of Georgia's budget. The Legislature didn't continue the program this year. Leaders in Georgia's 159 counties, beset by their own budget problems, said they could not cover the costs either. State lawmakers did not include the grant during this year's legislative session for the fiscal year that began July 1. Democratic Party leaders in the Georgia Legislature such as Dubose Porter, the husband of Cagle's Democratic opponent in the lieutenant governor's race, Carol Porter, argued to keep the grant. In her TV ad, Carol Porter has criticized Cagle for not continuing the grant. Cagle told the AJC in 2008 that he wanted to continue the grant, but Fry doesn't agree with those who say not funding the grant program equates to a tax increase. Alan Essig, executive director of the liberal-leaning Georgia Budget & Policy Institute, also believes it is not accurate to say not providing the credit is a tax increase. "What was taken out of the [state] budget was an appropriation," said Essig, a former state budget analyst. "It was a local tax that you give a credit to." Clint Mueller, the legislative director for the Association County Commissioners of Georgia, agreed. "They didn't force the [property tax] rate to go up," he said of the Legislature. "It was the elimination of the credit. ... Technically, it's not a tax increase." Still, the bottom line is that many Georgia homeowners will pay more for their property taxes. We found this the most persuasive argument. So where does that leave us? It's clear that there was no direct, across-the-board tax increase on Georgians. Some of the discussion turns into a semantic debate concerning what's a fee and what's a tax -- and whether there's truly a difference. We won't be able to settle that here. On the tax relief grant, while its demise wasn't technically a tax increase, the effect is that Georgia property owners are paying more. In all, we found Cagle's statement accurate but needs clarification on the tax relief grant. By the definition of our Truth-o-Meter, that rates as Mostly True.

pomt-04689	The stimulus program "cut taxes for 95 percent of the American people."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/06/bill-clinton/clinton-says-obama-cut-taxes-95-percent-people-thr/	Update, Sept. 6, 2012, 10:43 a.m.: When we first posted this item, we did not address the distinction between all Americans and all American workers. Our report now addresses that difference, and we have changed the rating from True to Half True. In making the case for President Barack Obama’s re-election, former President Bill Clinton vouched for job creation under Obama’s reign despite the "deeply damaged economy" he inherited. Clinton singled out Obama’s 2009 economic stimulus program, known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, as a positive step for the economy. "In 2010, as the president's recovery program kicked in, the job losses stopped and things began to turn around," Clinton said in his keynote Democratic National Convention speech. "The Recovery Act saved or created millions of jobs and cut taxes -- let me say this again -- cut taxes for 95 percent of the American people." Clinton borrowed this factoid from the man of the week, who made it part of his 2008 campaign and bragged about it in his 2010 State of the Union speech. That night, Obama said, "We cut taxes. We cut taxes for 95 percent of working families." PolitiFact rated that claim True. Here’s why: The stimulus included tax cuts for many Americans, including a broad cut known as "Making Work Pay" intended to offset payroll taxes, which are automatically taken out of most workers’ paychecks and are not refundable. Because of the stimulus, single workers collected a $400 tax credit, and working couples got $800. The credit didn’t come in the form of a check; it worked out so that most workers had about $400 less in federal income taxes withheld from their paychecks. The result mostly mirrored what Obama promised he would do on the campaign. Obama pledged tax cuts of $500 for each worker and $1,000 for working couples. We rated the promise a Compromise on our Obameter because the resulting tax cut was a little lower than what Obama wanted. Ahead of the 2008 election, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center analyzed the effects of Obama’s tax proposals for workers. The center determined about 95 percent -- more precisely, 94.3 percent -- of tax filers would receive a tax cut under Obama's plan based on the tax credit to offset payroll taxes. The 5-percent sliver of workers who wouldn’t qualify included couples who make more than $250,000 or a single person making over $200,000 The tax cut expired at the end of 2011. Obama won another round of tax cuts for most workers in a December 2010 tax deal with Republicans in Congress. Those tax cuts -- worth about 2 percent a week -- expire in 2013. However, Clinton left out an important qualifier: It’s a tax cut for 95 percent of working families. Not everyone works -- think seniors or the unemployed, for example -- and when you account for those people, the percentage of people who get a tax cut drops to approximately 75 percent. That’s still tax cuts for many Americans, but not close to the 95-percent range. We rate Clinton’s statement Half True.

Just one in three students is ready for college when he or she graduates high school. "That’s a problem, that’s a real problem," Weatherford said Sept. 10 as the guest speaker at a Suncoast Tiger Bay luncheon. "So while we’re having this debate about Common Core, and the grading system, and how much we pay our teachers, and how we should assess our students’ performance, just remember that one out of every three students currently today is ready for college before they go there." Weatherford earlier joked about intense PolitiFact coverage of "every word that comes out of my mouth," so we knew his team would not be surprised by us asking for backup of his claim that "one out of every three students currently today is ready for college before they go there." Weatherford spokesman Ryan Duffy responded to our inquiry on Twitter, directing us to Florida Department of Education data for the percentage of 2011 public high school graduates who took the SAT, ACT or CPT and scored at or above college-level scores. The state average was 64.7 percent. As Miami Herald political reporter Marc Caputo pointed out, that actually means two out of every three high school students graduates public school college-ready. Not one in three, as Weatherford said. Duffy acknowledged the flub. He insisted Weatherford has cited the statistic correctly in the past. Our ruling For us, the facts here aligned pretty easily (thanks, Twitter). Weatherford said one in three Florida students graduates high school prepared for college. Based on Florida Department of Education data, it’s two in three. We rate Weatherford’s claim False.	None	Will Weatherford	None	None	None	2013-09-11T14:32:32	2013-09-10	['None']
pomt-08927	The "state bureaucracy" Jane Norton managed "grew by $43 million in just three years."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/26/americans-job-security/jane-nortons-public-health-and-environment-departm/	An ad from a third-party group has Jane Norton blasting back and blaming her opponent in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate in Colorado. "Seen those TV ads attacking me? They're paid for by a shady interest group doing the bidding of Ken Buck," she said in reaction to the ad paid for by Americans for Job Security. "You'd think Ken would be man enough to do it himself." Norton says in the ad. "Here's the truth: In state government, I cut budgets, cut programs and reduced staff," Norton continues. "Ken Buck's Office? His spending skyrocketed by 40 percent. We need a senator who's actually cut spending, and has the backbone to stand her ground." The "shady interest group" Norton refers to is an outfit called Americans for Job Security. Here's their ad: "Our country is at the brink," a narrator says. "Colorado families and workers need relief -- yet Jane Norton supported the largest tax hike in Colorado history, costing us billions. And Jane Norton's record on government spending? The state bureaucracy she managed grew by $43 million in just three years. Record taxes and reckless spending has cost Colorado jobs. Call Jane Norton, tell her no more tax hikes and big government spending." Norton is a former lieutenant governor who got early backing from national Republican Party leaders. Buck, on the other hand, is the Weld County District Attorney and a former U.S. attorney and has received backing from the tea party movement. There are a lot of facts to sort through here. In this report, we're fact-checking the claim about Norton growing state bureaucracy; we also fact-checked whether she supported "the largest tax hike in Colorado history." And we're examining Norton's charges against Buck in still another report. Americans for Job Security said that "the state bureaucracy she managed grew by $43 million in just three years." The group -- a business league that's not required to disclose its donors -- based its claims on Norton's tenure as executive director of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment from 1999 to 2002. Norton was appointed by then Gov. Bill Owens, also a Republican. The department is in charge of public health, as well as things like air quality and nursing home regulations. Under Norton's tenure, the budget did grow from $226 million to $269 million. But most of that increase came from federal funds or cash funds from things like user fees. State funds to the department increased for a few years but then declined. Over Norton's entire tenure, state funding dropped from $23.7 million to $16.2 million. Finally, we should note that some people don't believe a state agency director has that much control over the amount of money an agency receives from the state. The reduction in state funding was part of large-scale budget cutting during a year of low tax revenues, according to a review of Norton's tenure at the Public Health and Environment Department in the Denver Post. The Americans for Job Security ad said that "the state bureaucracy she managed grew by $43 million in just three years."

pomt-10244	When Sarah Palin was in government, Barack Obama was a community organizer.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/31/john-mccain/palin-was-a-sports-reporter-when-obama-was-organiz/	The day after John McCain selected Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to be his running mate for the presidential campaign, McCain defended his pick from questions about her experience. Chris Wallace, who interviewed McCain on Aug. 30, 2008, for Fox News Sunday , asked McCain several questions about why he selected Palin. Here's one exchange: Wallace: "Senator, you talked about her years of experience. Ten of those years were as a city councilwoman and mayor of a town of 9,800 people. And in terms of foreign policy, in March of 2007, two months after the surge had started, she was asked about it, and she said: 'I've been focused on state government. I haven't focused on the war in Iraq.' Understandable for a governor; not understandable for a vice president." McCain: "Well, by the way, also she was a member of the PTA. I think it's wonderful. But the point is she has been to Kuwait. She has been over there. She has been with her troops, the National Guard that she commands, who had been over there and had the experience. I'm proud of her knowledge of these challenges and issues. And of course, as governor she has had enormous responsibilities, none of which Sen. Obama had. When she was in government, he was a community organizer. When she was taking tough positions against her own party, Senator Obama was voting 'present' 130 times in the state legislature, on every tough issue whatever it was, while she was taking them on. That's the kind of judgment that I'm confident that we need in Washington." We examined Obama's "present" votes in an article when the issue came up during the Democratic primary . It's true that Obama cast roughly 130 present votes from more than 4,000 votes cast during his time in the Illinois legislature. It's also true that Palin earned experience as a governor that Obama doesn't have, but then McCain doesn't have that, either. Here, we'll look at McCain's claim that Palin was in government while Obama was a community organizer. Palin and Obama are fairly close in age, only 2 years apart. As of this writing, Palin is 44 and Obama just turned 47. According to her biography from the Alaska governor's office, Palin graduated from the University of Idaho in 1987 with a degree in communications-journalism. She then worked as a television sports reporter from 1987 to 1989, according to the Almanac of American Politics. Her sports reporting career was at Anchorage's NBC affiliate KTUU, a fact the station noted in its biography of Palin, who then used her maiden name of Heath. Palin first took elected office in 1992 when she was elected to the city council of Wasilla, a town of 5,469, according to the 2000 U.S. Census. Obama, meanwhile, graduated from Columbia University with his bachelor's degree in 1983. He worked briefly for a business research firm before moving to Chicago to become a community organizer. He worked as a community organizer from 1985 to 1988 before leaving Chicago to attend Harvard Law School in 1988. In 1992, Obama had finished his law degree at Harvard and was directing a statewide voter registration drive. His work there earned him a mention in the annual "40 under 40" list published by Crain's Chicago Business to recognize the city's young leaders. Crain's credited him and a staff of 10 with registering 150,000 new voters. After the drive ended in November 1992, Obama went on to join a Chicago law firm and finish his memoir Dreams From My Father, which was published in 1995. He was elected to the Illinois legislature in 1996. When Obama talks about his days as a community organizer, he usually is referring to the work he did prior to law school, most notably organizing the community around Atgeld Gardens on the issues of asbestos removal from public housing. For McCain's statement to be true, you would have to consider Obama's voter registration drive work to be community organizing — an arguable point. In addition to that, municipal elections in Wasilla in 1992 were held in the first week in October, so at most Palin had won office for a month while Obama was a community organizer by an arguable definition. Because Obama's best-known days as a community organizer were prior to his graduation from Harvard Law School, from 1985 to 1988, and during those years Palin was graduating from college and working as a sports reporter, we rule McCain's statement False.

pomt-11454	The flu shot is "designed to spread cancer."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/09/meddaily/no-flu-shot-was-not-designed-spread-cancer/	Amid a severe flu season, an inaccurate story on Facebook said that the flu shot is laced with cancer-causing ingredients but provided no credible evidence. "Doctor blows whistle on flu shot: ‘it’s designed to spread cancer,’" said a Feb. 28 headline on Meddaily, an alternative medicine website. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We interviewed scientists who disputed the claim that the flu shot is linked to cancer. The story largely focuses on comments by Dr. John Bergman. We were unsuccessful in reaching Bergman. We messaged him on Facebook and received an automated message back that he no longer answers private messages. We searched for any credible newspaper articles that quoted a Dr. John Bergman about flu shots and found nothing. Meddaily wrote that Bergman "has revealed the influenza vaccinations being used to combat the latest H3N2 strain, are virtually ineffective and being forced onto the public through fear tactics to spread cancer." Meddaily also links to a video that has circulated for years by Dr. Joseph Mercola, who argues that the flu vaccine is ineffective. Mercola has been criticized by scientists and federal agencies for many years. The Meddaily article offers no credible evidence that the flu shot causes cancer. We sent the Meddaily article to three well-respected scientists who agreed the claims about the flu shot having "cancer-causing ingredients" or being "designed to spread cancer" were wrong. "What does this even mean?" said Aaron Carroll, a pediatrics professor at Indiana University. "Wouldn’t you need evidence that it’s ‘designed to spread cancer’ to make such a claim? I mean, you’d have to think the absolute worst about humanity, including pediatricians, to believe that." William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University, said that about 120 million to 150 million doses of the flu vaccine are given in the United States alone, in addition to millions of doses in other countries. "Would the World Health Organization be promoting a cancer-promoting product? No," he said. U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a Feb. 26 statement that the flu this year has "resulted in a record number of hospitalizations." The federal government continues to research why the effectiveness is lower this year, however, a preliminary finding suggests the cell-based influenza vaccine might be somewhat more effective than the egg-based vaccine. The overall estimated effectiveness of the 2017–18 seasonal influenza vaccine for preventing medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection was 36 percent, as of mid February. The CDC continues to recommend the flu shot because it can prevent some infections with currently circulating flu viruses. "Even with current vaccine effectiveness estimates, vaccination will still prevent influenza illness, including thousands of hospitalizations and deaths. Persons aged ≥6 months who have not yet been vaccinated this season should be vaccinated," the CDC wrote in February. Meddaily stated that the flu shot is "designed to spread cancer." Experts say this claim is nothing more than a ridiculous conspiracy theory. We rate this headline Pants on Fire.

pomt-07112	"Janice Hahn hired hard-core gang members with taxpayer money to be 'gang-intervention specialists.' She even helped them get out of jail, so they could rape and kill again."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/20/turn-right-usa/video-accuses-janice-hahn-hiring-gang-members-taxp/	It has been called one of the most offensive political videos ever. It has been denounced as vile, racist and sexist. So, naturally, it went viral on YouTube. It's only been up a few days, but as of June 17, 2011, the video attack on Los Angeles Councilwoman and Democratic congressional candidate Janice Hahn -- over her support for gang-intervention programs that use former gang members -- had already been viewed a half million times. What's all the hubbub? The video features a woman dancing on a stripper pole as two rappers hold guns and grab money out of her hot pants. "Give us your cash b--ch, so we can shoot up the streets. Give us your cash b--ch, so we can buy some more heat," they sing. When the woman turns around, there's a demonic version of Hahn's face superimposed. Putting aside the offensive images in the video, we wondered about the claim at the heart of the attack. It comes via a voiceover at the start of the video: "In an insane effort to reduce gang violence, Janice Hahn hired hardcore gang members with taxpayer money to be 'gang-intervention specialists.' She even helped them get out of jail, so they could rape and kill again." We spoke with the video's unapologetic creator, Ladd Ehlinger, who specializes in viral political videos. Remember the campaign video for Alabama Agriculture Commission candidate Dale Peterson, the rifle-toting cowboy who called his opponent a dummy? Then there was the one from congressional candidate Rick Barber where he had a fictitious conversation with several of the Founding Fathers, ending with George Washington saying through gritted teeth, "Gather ... your ... armies." And we can't forget the one that cast Nancy Pelosi as the Wicked Witch of the West. All Ehlinger. "I think it's only offensive to people who don't have a sense of humor," Ehlinger told us. Critics may call his latest video over-the-top, he said, but it drew attention to a piece of Hahn's record the media was ignoring. It's true that Hahn, whose district encompasses some gang-ridden neighborhoods of Watts, has been an active advocate for gang prevention programs that include the controversial practice of hiring ex-gang members to act as go-betweens for law enforcement, community activists and gangs. The issue, though, is whether Hahn hired these gang-intervention specialists with taxpayer money and even helped get some of them out of jail. The allegation is based largely on a 2008 Fox 11 (Los Angeles) story in which investigative reporter Chris Blatchford reported that anti-gang money was going to the gangsters themselves. In the Fox story, Watts gangster Steven Myrick is seen in a 2006 police video claiming that he "worked for" Janice Hahn and "that's why I'm out (of jail) right now. Miss Hahn got me out like three weeks ago." Myrick was released after an arrest for indecent exposure. He was later tied to a 2000 rape and robbery of a woman at gunpoint and was sentenced to life in prison. The Fox report includes several other examples of men hired as gang-intervention specialists, paid through programs sponsored by the city, who were still actively involved in gang activity. In the Fox report, Hahn defended the use of "gang-intervention specialists," saying, "I do know that it takes a different kind of person to be able to speak the language that convinces the shooters to not retaliate. And that's what we've achieved." Blatchford asked if that was like making a deal with the devil. "I see it as keeping the peace in a community that has been plagued with violence," Hahn said. Asked about the use of convicted criminals as gang-intervention specialists, Hahn responded, "I think you're saying some of these people have been part of the problem in the past. Well, I'm here to say they're part of the solution now. And I think that's positive." Two weeks after the Fox 11 report, the Torrance, Calif., Daily Breeze published a story that purported to largely debunk the Fox story. Reporter Gene Maddaus wrote that a review of the Fox report "found major flaws that undermine its central allegations. Most notably, records and interviews show that the gang-intervention workers identified in the report have not received city funding. Additionally, a convicted rapist was wrongly identified as a gang-intervention worker, and Hahn was mistakenly accused of providing funds directly to gang workers." According to the story, Myrick, who was featured prominently in the Fox report, "attended a few task force meetings and took an interest in facilitating peace between gangsters. At one point, he was arrested for violating an order to stay out of Imperial Courts [housing project], and his wife came to a meeting to urge Hahn to help get him out." "The only thing I've ever done is call and ask what the basis of an arrest was," Hahn told the Daily Breeze. "I never called to get anyone out of jail." According to the Daily Breeze, "Myrick was released and apparently believed that Hahn had pulled strings for him. He was arrested again a few weeks later, in March 2006, on a 'cold hit' from a 6-year-old rape case." Despite Myrick's claim that he was getting paid to help facilitate nonviolence, the Daily Breeze reported it could find no evidence that Myrick was paid as a gang-intervention specialist, nor that he ever received city funds. Other gang-intervention specialists mentioned in the Fox story were reported to have been paid through an organization called Unity One, which the Daily Beeze noted is almost entirely funded with private sources. The story noted that Unity One did receive $60,000 a year from a subcontract with the Toberman Settlement House, with money that originated from the city's Community Development Department. But, the story noted, records showed the the funding went to pay Unity One's president and program manager, and "Hahn did not obtain that money for Unity One." We spoke to Cornell Ward, executive director of Unity One, who acknowledged they do hire ex-gang members to act as gang-intervention specialists. But he said Unity One does not get government funding, and he dismissed the idea that Hahn ever directed any city funds to hire gang-intervention specialists. "She didn't give them a dime," Ward said. "She didn't give us one red cent." When we contacted Hahn's campaign, spokesman Dave Jacobson reiterated the point that Hahn did not "directly" fund gang-intervention specialists. Bu that doesn't mean city money doesn't filter to them. "She (Hahn) did not hire any gangsters," said civil rights lawyer and gang expert Connie Rice. "The city doesn’t pay the intervention specialists directly." Rather, Rice said, city funds go to agencies like hers, the Advancement Project in Los Angeles, which then go out and hire intervention specialists. And, she said, it works: violence is down. That's why city and county law enforcement agencies routinely work with organizations that hire former gang members to "interface" with the gang community, she said. "We have to engage with the people doing the damage," said Rice. "Do we talk to actual gangsters, yes," Rice said. "We ask them not to shoot kids. This is the reality. We're trying to save lives, not score political points. It's smart policy." Is it controversial? Sure, Rice said. And sometimes some of the people hired for gang-intervention work "mess up." Those found to be abusing the system are cut off, she said. That doesn't mean the program isn't working, she said. "You can throw stones at that," Rice said, but the reality is "when you go into gang-controlled hot spots, you have to deal with the gangs. People don't understand what we're facing out here. In our hots spots, we still have the OK Corral." Watts is one of the most dangerous places in the country, she said. And it's in Hahn's district. "As a councilwoman, she had to do something," Rice said. We asked Hahn campaign spokesman Jacobson whether, if the city pays money to agencies that, in turn, hire ex-gang members as gang-intervention specialists, isn't that the same thing as them being paid with taxpayer money? "The city funds are used to fund a three-pronged approach to fight the war on gangs," Jacobson responded by e-mail. "That includes funding gang prevention, suppression, and intervention services. In the past couple years, the rules about who gets money have become much, much stricter. And funds do not go to organizations unless they can show that their staffers are not involved in gangs and have gone through a rigorous training program on how to be an effective part of community policing." So what about the charge that Hahn "even helped them get out of jail, so they could rape and kill again." The only evidence that she intervened in that way comes from Myrick's taped statements to police. Myrick certainly suggests she did. "The entire Fox story was based on statements made by desperate criminal gang members who would say anything to avoid going to jail," Hahn said at the time. "I have never paid these gang members, never had them work for me, nor have I ever helped them to get out of jail." Said Fox reporter Blatchford: "We stand behind everything in our report." We should note that Hahn has since filed a complaint with the Federal Elections Commission alleging the political action committee that paid for the video, Turn Right USA, is connected to the campaign of her Republican opponent. Both Hahn's opponent in the congressional race and Ehlinger vehemently deny that. Republican Craig Huey, who will face Hahn in a July 12 special election, released a statement condemning the ad, saying it was not authorized or affiliated with his campaign. "The ad is blatantly racist and sexist, and neither racism nor sexism has any place in the public sphere," Huey stated. According to its website, Turn Right USA is "a non-connected, expenditure only political action committee (SuperPAC), definitely not authorized by any candidate or candidate’s committee." Talking Points Memo reported that the group's treasurer said he may resign because, "I just don't approve of that video." For his part, video creator Ehlinger isn't backing off one inch. He said the allegation about Hahn getting gangsters out of jail early comes right from the mouth of Myrick, who is serving a life sentence for rape and robbery. Said Ehlinger: "I'm going to take him at his word. I trust Myrick's word over Janice Hahn's. And you should, too." He added that Hahn is simply hiding behind the fact that she (and the city) didn't give money directly to former gang members. "No one ever said Hahn pulled money out of her purse and paid them," he said. But the city paid third-party programs that paid these intervention specialists, he said. It may be one step removed, he said, but it amounts to the same thing. Rice says she welcomes a public dialogue about the controversial practice of using former gang members as intervention specialists. But this video, which she said was made by "lazy political assassins," is not the right way. "I don't understand why we have to look at it through this false lens that these propagandists ginned up," Rice said. If a "vile, sexist and misogynistic" video is the only way to get enough attention to have serious discussion about the issue, she said, "that's bad news for constitutional democracy." We're not going to debate the methods people use to get out their political message these days. The reality is that viral political videos, like chain e-mails, often reach a large audience and leave an impression. So what is the truth? We think the onus falls on the folks making the claim to back it up, and the makers of the video produce no hard evidence to support it. There's ample evidence that Hahn has been an advocate of programs that use ex-gang members as intervention specialists. And while the city does not fund these intervention specialists directly, it funds agencies that do. Still, it's a stretch to say "Janice Hahn hired hard-core gang members with taxpayer money to be 'gang-intervention specialists.'" That suggests she selected the ex-gang members tapped to be intervention specialists or that she paid them herself, and there's no evidence of that. We also think it's a stretch to accuse Hahn of getting gangsters out of jail based solely on the comments of one gang member facing serious criminal charges. Hahn acknowledges she made a call to to find out the basis for Myrick's arrest. Perhaps that was interpreted by Myrick or police as Hahn intervening on his behalf. Other than Myrick's hearsay declaration, however, the video and its producer present no proof that she did. That's not good enough to give it credibility. We rate the claim False.

pomt-01105	The cheerleaders for the Dallas Cowboys have "entertained more troops in the world than Bob Hope."	false	/texas/statements/2015/jan/09/jerry-jones/jerry-jones-says-dallas-cowboy-cheerleaders-have-e/	Jerry Jones said the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders have outflanked one of the country’s most-traveled actor-comedians. Jones, who owns the football team, spoke to ESPN’s Mike and Mike on Jan. 8, 2015, in the Dallas-area studio where the cheerleaders practice, according to a blog post by the Dallas Morning News. Opening the 15-minute interview, which aired the next morning, Jones stressed the location, saying: "We’re sitting here in the area where the cheerleaders perform. I’ll get my little plug in there." Then Jones said: "They’ve entertained more troops in the world than Bob Hope." Now this isn’t politics. But Jones made his claim in Texas and the late Hope, friend to presidents and world leaders, would surely holler for the Truth-O-Meter if he could, maybe waving a golf club. Hope and the troops Over decades, often around Christmas, Hope flew the globe to put on shows for U.S. troops. In his later years, the shows were taped as TV specials. According to a web page for the USO, the nonprofit dedicated to lifting the spirits of troops, Hope performed his first USO show in California in May 1941. "Hope entertained" with the USO "until December 1990, when he brought laughter and Christmas cheer to troops participating in Operation Desert Shield in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain on his final USO tour," the page says. A USO timeline, on another web page, says in the entry for 1943: "Over the course of his career, Hope appeared in or hosted almost 200 USO performances, including annual Christmas tours for 35 consecutive years." Hope's run with the USO nearly reached 50 years. By telephone, though, USO spokeswoman Gayle Fishel said she was uncertain the organization had a tally of the number of troops Hope ultimately entertained. Maybe millions? A 1997 congressional resolution, deeming Hope an honorary veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces, said that during "World War II, the Korean Conflict, the Vietnam War, and the Persian Gulf War and throughout the Cold War, Bob Hope traveled to visit and entertain millions of United States service members in numerous countries, on ships at sea, and in combat zones ashore." Responding to our inquiry by email, James Hardy, producer for Bob Hope Enterprises, Inc., pointed out an Air Force web page stating: "For more than 50 years, Bob Hope entertained men and women of the U.S. Air Force and the other services at home and overseas, in peace and in war. At least 10,000,000 G.I.s benefited from his efforts." Hardy said Hope routinely did 150 shows during a USO tour. Cheerleaders and the troops Dallas Cowboys officials replied to our query about Jones’ statement by noting the cheerleaders have been doing performance tours in coordination with the Department of Defense since a 1979 tour in South Korea. A page in the Cowboys media guide, emailed to us by the team, states the cheerleaders’ Show Group has made "more international tours with the USO than any other entertainment group. They bring their own special brand of goodwill and gratitude to the men and women in the military, traveling to locations as diverse as Iraq, Bosnia, Afghanistan, Cuba, Korea and the Persian Gulf." Through 2014, the team told us, the cheerleaders had teamed up the government 78 times "to boost the morale of the men, women and families of our U.S. military at hundreds of bases and outposts around the world." Separately, USO spokeswoman Sharee Posey emailed that since 2002, the Cowboys cheerleaders had entertained more than 198,000 troops and military families. Posey said USO does not have information on Hope's appearances. We pressed Dalrymple on how Jones concluded the cheerleaders had entertained more troops than Hope. Spokesman Rich Dalrymple replied that the team hasn’t laid claim to the cheerleaders entertaining more troops than Hope. But Jones did, yes? "Evidently he did not have his facts correct, which is my fault, so you can blame me," Dalrymple said by email. Our ruling Jones said the cheerleaders for the Dallas Cowboys have "entertained more troops in the world than Bob Hope." The cheerleaders may be outpacing other groups in USO tours, having toured nearly 80 times. But it looks like Hope, who died at 100 in July 2003, performed before more troops, given that he had nearly 200 USO swings. We rate Jones' claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

UPDATE, 4 p.m., Jan. 13, 2015: We updated this story Jan. 12, 2015, to correct the spelling of a USO official's name and to fold in that group's count of the troops entertained by the Cowboys cheerleaders since 2002. We updated it afresh the next day to add an Air Force mention of Hope entertaining millions of troops. These changes did not affect the rating of the statement.

pomt-00919	More than 1 million Texans live without affordable health care because Rick Perry failed to "partner with the Legislature to find a Texas solution to closing the coverage gap."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2015/mar/01/texas-democratic-party/texas-democrats-say-rick-perry-left-more-1-million/	By not teaming with legislators, Rick Perry left many Texans without reasonable health care, a Democratic group says. The Texas Democratic Party popped this claim a day after the former governor and 2016 Republican presidential prospect told New Hampshire residents: "People criticize us for having a large number of uninsured. That’s what Texans decided they wanted. They did not want government forcing everyone to buy insurance." According to a Dallas Morning News blog post datelined Bedford, N.H., Perry was referring to Texas’ refusal, under his leadership, to create an insurance marketplace--leaving it to the federal government to do so--or to expand Medicaid as permitted under the federal Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. Javier Gamboa, the Democratic Party’s spokesman, reacted in a Feb. 12, 2015, press release: "Perry should be ashamed of himself for saying that the people of Texas did not want increased coverage and expanded access to healthcare. More than one million hardworking Texans are living without affordable care because of his failure to partner with the Legislature to find a Texas solution to closing the coverage gap." Is all of this so? Perry and legislators Perry won his last term as governor in 2010, the year the then-Democratic-controlled Congress and President Barack Obama agreed to mandate health coverage for most Americans. The law also permitted states to widen access to Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance, with Uncle Sam covering related costs for three years. But Perry was adamant about Texas not expanding; in July 2012, he rejected the deal, calling the offer a brazen intrusion into state sovereignty. And in 2013, the Republican-led Legislature, in accord with Perry, "shot down federal efforts to cover uninsured, low-income Texans by expanding access to Medicaid," according to a May 2013 Austin American-Statesman news story. Texans in the 'coverage gap' So what is this "coverage gap" and how many Texans fall into it? In 2014, uninsured Texans earning 100 to 400 percent of the federal poverty level began to be offered subsidies to help buy insurance on an online healthcare exchange or marketplace. However, as the Statesman story said, Texas adults living below the poverty line—then $11,170 for an individual, $19,090 for a family of three—won no change in access. Some 947,000 uninsured Texas adults were living below the poverty line at the time, the story said. Varied estimates Mindful that figure is years old, we hunted fresh data. Replying to our requests for elaboration, the Democratic spokesman, Gamboa, pointed out news stories, including a January 2015 Associated Press news story stating: "Texas leads the nation in uninsured, with nearly a quarter of the state’s population—6.4 million people—lacking health insurance." That story said the Obamacare law "mandates expanding Medicaid to residents with incomes less than 138 percent of the federal poverty level, but a Supreme Court ruling left expansion up to each state and Texas said no. "That created a ‘coverage gap’ of more than 1 million Texans who aren’t poor enough to qualify for Medicaid," the story said, "but don’t earn enough to receive the law’s new subsidized health insurance." But there also are other estimates. In particular, Anne Dunkelberg of the Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for low-income residents, initially nudged by email that according to the center’s interactive Health & Wealth County Checkup website, nearly 1.2 million to nearly 1.3 million Texans fit the coverage gap. Drawing on an October 2013 report from the Kaiser Family Foundation, itself rooted in Census Bureau surveys asking whether respondents had health insurance, the center reached a rough estimate of 1,151,410 to 1,208,090 Texans in the coverage gap. The foundation is a nonpartisan health policy research group, Also, the center notes, a February 2014 report by the Urban Institute, limited to estimates for major urban counties, supports the estimate of 1,293,100 Texans in the coverage gap. A November 2014 analysis Most recently, a November 2014 Kaiser report said that in states that do not expand Medicaid, many adults fall into a ‘coverage gap’ of having incomes above Medicaid eligibility limits but below the lower limit for Marketplace premium tax credits," meaning the Obamacare subsidies. The report, starting from the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey results for 2014, offered this illustration of its estimated nearly 4 million citizens in the gap--one quarter of them, or 948,000, living in Texas--who would have been newly eligible for Medicaid if their state had expanded coverage: Source: Report, "The Coverage Gap: Uninsured Poor Adults in States that Do Not Expand Medicaid – An Update," Kaiser Family Foundation, Nov. 12, 2014 (accessed Feb. 24, 2105) By email, Kaiser spokesman Chris Lee told us the 948,000 figure was the organization’s latest estimate of Texans lacking insurance who would be eligible for Medicaid if Texas agreed to expand access. Experts told us there is one other way to use Census Bureau surveys to estimate Texans in the coverage gap. By email, a bureau demographer, Carla Medalia, guided us to results from the 2013 American Community Survey indicating that nearly 1.4 million Texans aged 18 through 64 were uninsured and living below the poverty level--meaning they weren’t eligible either for Medicaid in Texas or for Obamacare subsidies; they’re potential gappers. Dunkelberg cautioned, though, that the bureau figures don’t filter out residents living in the country without legal authorization or legal immigrants here less than five years; members of both subgroups would be ineligible for Medicaid. On balance of late, Dunkelberg said, she’s been saying around 1 million Texans fall into the gap. Affordable care? Next, we wondered if individuals in the gap live without affordable care, as the Democrats said. Nationally, the Kaiser report offered its read of what kinds of Americans fit the coverage gap. "While nearly half of people in the coverage gap report that their health is excellent or very good, nearly a fifth (18%) report that they are in fair or poor health," the report said. "These individuals have known health problems that likely require medical attention." The report also recapped whether individuals in the gap otherwise reported having access to coverage, perhaps through a family member’s job. "The work status of people in the coverage gap indicates that there are limited coverage options available for people in this situation," the report said. "Two-thirds (66%) of people in the coverage gap are in a family with a worker, and 54% are working themselves," the report said. "While workers could potentially have an offer of coverage through their employer, the majority of workers in the coverage gap (51%) work for small firms (<50 employees) that will not be subject to ACA penalties for not offering coverage. Further, many firms do not offer coverage to part-time workers. A majority of workers in the coverage gap also work in industries with historically low insurance rates, such as the agriculture and service industries. More than a third (34%) of adults in the coverage gap are in a family with no workers." Our ruling The Democratic Party said more than 1 million Texans live without affordable health care because Perry failed to "partner with the Legislature to find a Texas solution to closing the coverage gap." Per the latest estimates, it’s safe to say around a million Texas adults fall into the coverage gap for making too little money to qualify for insurance subsidies and also remaining ineligible for Medicaid unless Texas expands access as encouraged by the Obamacare law and rejected by Perry and the state’s ruling Republicans. Less certain is what kind of care is available to those people in the gap and how affordable it might be for them. We rate this statement, which lacked clarification, Mostly True.

pomt-01570	"Under Rick Scott, homeowners are paying higher (home insurance) premiums for less coverage."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/sep/10/charlie-crist/homeowners-are-paying-more-less-insurance-coverage/	It didn’t take long for Charlie Crist to fire a major volley in the battle for the governor’s mansion, taking aim at incumbent Rick Scott’s record on homeowner’s insurance. Soon after the August primary, Crist outlined a plan to "reverse Ricks Scott’s hikes to property insurance." The Sept. 4 document compared the new Democrat’s record on the issue to Scott’s, saying the cost-to-benefit ratio has been going in the wrong direction. "During Scott’s tenure, premiums rose while the amount of coverage declined," Crist’s plan read. "In other words, under Rick Scott, homeowners are paying higher premiums for less coverage." The insurance market has been on a rollercoaster ride the past decade, with consumers reeling from the highest costs for homeowner’s insurance in the nation. Are homeowners paying more for less coverage under the current Republican governor? It’s PolitiFact Florida’s policy to check the paper trail very carefully. A familiar pledge Crist is no stranger to making insurance rates a campaign issue. When he campaigned as a Republican in 2006, he pledged to bring rates down after eight hurricanes hit the state in 2004 and 2005, catapulting premiums ever higher. He followed through on a promise to call a special session of the Legislature in January 2007. The result was HB 1A, which expanded state-sponsored reinsurance (essentially insurance for insurers) for private carriers and froze rates for Citizens Property Insurance Corp., the state-run insurer of last resort. Because private insurers began charging such high premiums, Citizens had taken on some 400,000 more policies between 2004 and 2007, for a total of 1.2 million properties covered as private insurers looked to reduce their exposure in Florida. Industry experts warned that a major side effect of expanding Citizens was that the company would not be able to pay claims in the event of a direct hit by a hurricane, resulting in a statewide assessment on all policies. The rate freeze eventually stretched on until 2009, when Crist signed HB 1495, which passed the Legislature with strong support. That law allowed rate increases of up to 10 percent to help Citizens become actuarially sound. Florida’s insurance rates began another upward climb under Crist, despite no direct hits from hurricanes since 2005. Scott came into office in 2011 looking to reduce the high number of Citizens policies by turning to the private insurance market. His first year, he signed SB 408, which insurance companies and business groups praised. This is the bill Crist blames for rising premiums and reduced coverage; Crist vetoed a similar bill near the end of his term. Critics warned the legislation was bad for consumers because it allowed a reduction in overall coverage limits, shortened the window for filing sinkhole and storm-related damage claims, and limited claims for damage caused by sinkholes to primary structures, among other things. SB 408 also made carriers file requests with the regulation office for rate increases up to 15 percent to account for higher reinsurance costs. The law also allowed insurers to pay back some claims at actual cash value -- the cost of the insured dwelling minus depreciation -- instead of replacement value, depending on the policy. By the following year, Citizens began limiting coverage on most policies to the primary structure, leaving out things like gazebos, awnings, carports and pool enclosures. That was something private insurers had been doing since Hurricane Wilma in 2005. We took a look at average premiums for all private homeowners insurance policies over the last eight years. (Crist’s plan referred to all these years except 2014’s first quarter totals, as well, which the state’s Office of Insurance Regulation said were accurate). Total exposure is the amount both private companies and Citizens were liable to cover, while total premiums paid is the amount all policies collected in premiums. The state maintained a steady run of roughly 6 million total policies during this time period: Year/governor Average premium Total exposure Total premiums paid 2007/Crist $1,679 $1.82 trillion $9.6 billion 2008/Crist $1,463 $1.9 trillion $8.6 billion 2009/Crist $1,421 $1.9 trillion $8.3 billion 2010/Crist $1,518 $1.88 trillion $8.8 billion 2011/Scott $1,608 $1.88 trillion $9.3 billion 2012/Scott $1,670 $1.83 trillion $9.6 billion 2013/Scott $1,732 $1.82 trillion $10 billion 2014/Scott* $1,741 $1.68 trillion $9.5 billion * as of March 2014, excludes State Farm The chart shows that premiums dropped the first year after Crist took office, even while more coverage was in force. Premiums went up and exposure went down in 2010, Crist’s final year in office, but the trend really took off after Scott took office. Premiums continued to rise while exposure fell by some $200 billion. Scott’s aim was to shrink Citizens, and that’s what happened (his campaign promise to make Citizens "actuarially sound" is on our Scott-O-Meter). The state insurer slimmed down by more than 400,000 policies, largely by "taking out" customers, in which private insurers assumed coverage at slightly different terms. While customers were allowed to refuse the switch, the new policies often were less expensive than Citizens policies, with marginally better terms. On Sept. 4, the same day Crist released his plan to lower insurance rates if elected, the state Office of Insurance Regulation authorized 14 insurers to assume up to more than 425,000 Citizens policies, further shrinking the state’s pool of customers and reducing the company’s risk. It is the single largest authorized removal since Citizens was formed in 2002, although far fewer than that are likely to move to private insurers. There’s no question SB 408, passed under Scott, allowed rates to increase and coverage to be restricted, because that’s what it was supposed to do, according to Citizens media relations manager Michael Peltier. He told PolitiFact Florida that changes in sinkhole coverage were necessary because of a dramatic increase in claims that often were fraudulent. The problem hadn’t been addressed and was increasingly becoming an issue after those historic hurricane seasons in 2004 and 2005, leading to the 2007 legislation that froze rates. "The rates have been raised since (SB) 408 and there have been more stricter policies since (SB) 408, but those are making up for prior deficits," Peltier said. He said now that rates have gone up and exposure has gone down, the company is in a much better position. It’s not all rosy, however, because some customers still cannot afford the coverage they need, since sinkhole coverage is not a part of a base policy. The entire insurance industry has insisted there are many other factors forcing continued rate increases, such as reinsurance costs and payouts for other claims beyond hurricane damage. For example, State Insurance Consumer Advocate Steve Burgess said, companies have pointed to a recent spike in claims on homeowners policies over water damage. Reports have surfaced of attorneys convincing contractors they were being shortchanged by insurance companies to repair damage from leaky pipes and floods. Data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in 2013 ranked Florida as having the most expensive homeowners insurance in the nation. Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty said in a January 2014 report that after years of double-digit increases, a half dozen top insurers suddenly had sought or approved cutting future premiums between 2.4 and 9.2 percent. Companies that had initially wanted increases reversed themselves when their savings on reinsurance came to light. Citizens in August also asked for a 2015 rate cut for about 70 percent of its customers.The state approved a slightly larger break than what was requested in September, and Citizens had to back off a plan to raise sinkhole rates in Hernando County. Peltier said the drop in exposure, the terms of 408 and the recent lower cost of reinsurance all helped bring about the lower premiums. The lack of hurricanes since 2005 has been a big help, as well. "It’s taken time," Peltier said. "Since (SB) 408 has had such an effect on our claims, we can’t project what our losses are going to be. We’ve had to wait." Our ruling Charlie Crist said "under Rick Scott, homeowners are paying higher premiums for less coverage." He was referring to a controversial bill Scott signed in 2011, right after taking office, that made a host of changes to the insurance industry and allowed rates to go up. The insurance industry says these changes were necessary to remain solvent after dealing with a host of factors, including two very active hurricane seasons, a jump in sinkhole claims and high reinsurance costs. Those issues have since ebbed, and many policyholders should now enjoy a small break on premiums. Rates have been rising since Crist’s last year in office, in part because companies sought to catch up from limits placed on them by his 2007 legislative push after premiums rocketed out of control. That’s a bit of additional information Crist didn’t include in his attack on Scott, but his statement is still accurate. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-00283	Says "Christine Blasey Ford’s letter to Sen. Dianne Feinstein revealed to be a total FAKE… contains 14 glaring errors that could only be committed by a poorly educated writer." ​	pants on fire!	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/sep/28/blog-posting/no-christine-blasey-fords-letter-wasnt-written-som/	Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee questioned many aspects of sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during the hearing on Sept. 27. However, the authorship of the initial letter outlining one accusation was not in dispute. Christine Blasey Ford wrote a confidential letter to her congresswoman over the summer saying she was sexually assaulted by Kavanaugh while the two were in high school. The committee’s top Republican Sen. Charles Grassley released that letter publicly on Sept. 23. Ranking committee member Sen. Dianne Feinstein sent him the letter Sept. 20. Some websites have questioned the letter’s legitimacy, saying Ford did not author the letter. Ford has now testified under oath that she did. The blog Natural News makes the claim, saying the letter contains "14 glaring errors that could only be committed by a poorly educated writer." This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Ford is a California psychology professor who says Kavanaugh assaulted her at a party in 1982. The blog says that because Ford is an academic, grammatical errors in her letter indicate she did not write it. Some of these "errors" in the letter nitpick word choice. The blogger points out phrases like "the two scrapped with each other" and "I feared he may inadvertently kill me" as examples of poor or odd phrasing. Other "errors" could be due to copying procedures. An "I" toward the end of the document has a blur that makes it look lowercase. A line of text is stretched larger than other lines in the scan. The blogger points to the warp as an attempt to alter the content of the letter because that line has Kavanaugh’s name in it. Kavanaugh is named several other places in the letter without any text warping. Another of the "errors" is that Ford uses the phrase "opportune moment." The blogger says that wording "indicates a low-level writer attempting to sound sophisticated." That’s an unfounded opinion, not an error. This isn’t the first time Natural News has made ridiculous claims related to Ford’s credibility or motives. We gave the blog a Pants on Fire rating for a claim that Ford came forward to "protect abortion industry profits." This isn’t any less absurd. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-00895	The infant mortality rate is 15 percent higher in states with right-to-work laws.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/mar/05/julie-lassa/julie-lassa-says-infant-mortality-rate-15-percent-/	The arguments against right-to-work legislation usually focus on economic matters. Supporters say such a law will make a state more friendly to business; opponents say it will reduce the strength of unions, and depress the state’s wages and incomes. The Republican-pushed bill, which prohibits employers from signing contracts with unions that require employees to pay union dues, was fast tracked in the Legislature and is expected to reach Gov. Scott Walker’s desk by March 6, 2015. When the state Senate debated the right-to-work bill Feb. 25, 2015, state Sen. Julie Lassa (D-Stevens Point) criticized the measure with the wages-and-income argument -- then she took it a step further. Said Lassa: "Families in right-to-work states are less likely to have health insurance, and the infant mortality rate is 15 percent higher than in other states." Wait. Babies are at greater risk of death in right-to-work states? Looking at the evidence When we asked Lassa for her evidence, her staff pointed to a Jan. 23, 2015 report by the liberal Economic Policy Institute written by Gordon Lafer, a political economist at the University of Oregon. His report says that by a number of measures -- including infant mortality rates -- Wisconsin fares better than the 24 states with right-to-work laws. And he says right-to-work states are worse off than those without such laws. For infant mortality numbers, Lafer relies on data from 2010 collected by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. To do the right-to-work comparison, he added up the infant mortality rates in those states and divided by 24, to get 6.7 deaths per 1,000 births. The same approach for the other states found 5.8 deaths per 1,000 births. The difference is 15 percent. But simply adding up the rates and dividing by the number of states isn’t an accurate method because the calculation could be skewed by states with relatively more or fewer births and deaths, said Geoffrey Swain, medical director and chief medical officer for the City of Milwaukee Health Department, and an expert on infant mortality. His office provided the raw data from the CDC for births and infant deaths for 2012, the most recent year available. Using those numbers, right-to-work states had 6.48 deaths per 1,000 live births, while the remaining states (and the District of Columbia) had 5.54. The difference under this approach is actually larger -- 16.97 percent. So, Lassa is about right when it comes to the numbers. But she linked the number to right-to-work status, suggesting there is a causal relationship: One leads to the other. That’s a lot less clear, and it depends on the impact the law would have on the state’s economy, income and wages. And, of course, the sides disagree on that front. A study prepared for the conservative Wisconsin Policy Research Institute by Ohio University economist Richard Vedder argues that right-to-work laws added "about six percentage points to the growth rate of RTW states from 1983 to 2013. With such a law, Wisconsin’s per capita personal income growth of 53.29 percent would have been, instead, about 59.29 percent." Translated: right-to-work boosts the economy and wages. Lafer’s report comes to a much different conclusion. His study says right-to-work "is associated with lower wages and benefits for both union and nonunion workers. In a RTW state, the average worker makes 3.2 percent less than a similar worker in a non-RTW state." He also said average household income in right-to-work states is $6,430 less than in states without such laws. Of course, it’s impossible to predict how the law will affect jobs and wages in Wisconsin. The linkage Lafer -- and Lassa -- make also is based upon the idea that infant mortality rates are themselves correlated with poverty and other factors. Swain noted that a 2012 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that there was an improvement in key factors affecting infant mortality when the federal earned income tax credit -- targeted at low income people -- was expanded. Putting a relatively modest amount of money in the hands of the most needy helped, Swain said. "These people are living on the margins and giving them a little more (income) would make a difference," Swain said. Therefore, he said, "it’s likely that lower wages are going to lead to worse outcomes." For their part, CDC officials say they "haven’t investigated the association between wages (or right to work states) and infant mortality." Our rating Lassa says right-to-work states have higher infant mortality than states without such a law. She’s right on the raw numbers. But there are many more factors at work -- some of them are vigorously disputed -- when it comes to how such laws affect wages, incomes and especially lower income people whose babies are more at risk. That’s simply not settled. Over the years, we have examined a series of claims that take a wage or job related statistic and say it is either better or worse in a right-to-work state. Generally, we have rated these Half True -- the statistic is right, but there is no clear evidence of a causal relationship. That fits here as well.

pomt-03997	"The brutal fact is, when it comes to education, America is slipping" behind other nations.	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2013/feb/08/bob-mcdonnell/mcdonnell-says-us-education-slipping-behind-other-/	For the good of the state and the good of the nation, Gov. Bob McDonnell has asked the General Assembly to approve a package of education reforms this winter. "The brutal fact is, when it comes to educating our young people, America is slipping," McDonnell said in his State of the Commonwealth address on Jan. 9. "While Virginia's schools rate well nationally, according to the Program for International Student Assessment, the United States now ranks 14th in reading, 17th in science, and 25th in mathematics." he added. "This is unacceptable. Those are not grades that we want to put on the national refrigerator." We checked whether the U.S. really is slipping in world education rankings. McDonnell made the claim while urging lawmakers to approve his education agenda that would grade all public schools and empower the state to take over schools that receive failing marks. The international assessment test McDonnell cited is a two-hour exam given to a representative sample of 15-year-olds in an increasing number of nations. The testing started in 2000 and has been given every three years to measure literacy in reading, math and science. The results show the average scores, weighted for demographics, in each country. Most of the 34 member nations belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -- an industrialized group of mostly Western European and North American countries -- participate each testing cycle. A smattering of other countries, such as Russia, Indonesia and Brazil, and regional educational systems in China also take part. In 2000, 32 countries participated. That grew to 65 nations in 2009, the most recent test year with published results. Let’s look at the United States’ rankings, as reported by the National Center for Educational Statistics: Reading *In 2000, the U.S. was 15th among 28 OECD countries and 15th of 32 total nations. *In 2003, 15th among 30 OECD countries and 18th among 41 overall. *In 2006, U.S. scores were not tabulated because of a printing error in the test books. *In 2009, tied for 12th among 34 OECD countries and was 15th among 65 total nations. Science *In 2000, the U.S. was 14th among the 28 OECD countries and 14th of 32 total nations. *In 2003, 19th among 30 OECD countries and 22nd among 41 overall. *In 2006, 21st among 30 OECD countries and 27th among 57 overall. *In 2009, 17th among 34 OECD countries and 23rd among 65 overall. Math *In 2000, the U.S was 18th among 28 OECD countries and 19th of 32 total nations. *In 2003, 24th among 30 OECD countries and 27th among 41 overall. *In 2006, 25th among 30 OECD countries and 35th among 57 overall. *In 2009, 25th among 34 OECD countries and 31st among 65 overall. Now, let’s take a look at the actual test scores over the last decade, which were calculated on a scale from 0 to 1,000. We can compare the average score of U.S. students to those of all students from OECD nations. The National Center for Educational Statistics does not compute a worldwide average that includes every single nation that participates in the test. In reading, the U.S. average was 504 in 2000, 495 in 2003 and 500 in 2009. Results, as we noted, were not tabulated in 2006. The OECD average was 500 in 2000, 494 in 2003 and 493 in 2009. In science, the U.S. average was 499 in 2000, 491 in 2003, 489 in 2006 and 502 in 2009. The OECD average was each year was either 500 or 501. In math, U.S. students scored 493 in 2000, 483 in 2003, 474 in 2006 and 487 in 2009. The OECD average was 500 for the first two tests, followed by 498 and 496. What conclusions should be drawn from this data? Experts said the results do not show a decline in America’s education standing, but a solid, middle-of-the pack position. "The pattern of scores over the years shows that we’ve held fairly steady," said Robert Pianta, dean of the Curry School of Education at the University of Virginia. Tom Loveless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies international testing, said scores bounce around routinely, but the long-term trend is positive in American education. The U.S. participates in several international tests and typically scores in the the middle or just above the middle of the pack. "All these tests measure different things, but they all confirm that education is improving, it could be improving faster and there is more room for improvement, but we’re definitely not in decline," he said. "The idea that any of these tests are saying that American education is in decline is false." McDonnell is hardly the first politician to claim the U.S. education system is slipping in status. Mitt Romney, the Republican candidate for president last year, cited the same statistics and said the country has "fallen way behind." And in 2009, President Barack Obama said that "we have let our grades slip" and "other nations outpace us." Loveless says it’s simply not the case. "The first international test was given in 1960 to 12 countries and the U.S. came in 11th out of 12," he said. "We’ve never done well on these tests." Loveless said the U.S. -- unlike some of the nations with top test rankings -- tends to prize well-rounded students by teaching many subjects, encouraging extracurricular activities and social interaction at school. We asked McDonnell’s office if it had any further explanation of the governor’s statement. "In the past decade, the United States has not ranked among the top 10 countries in reading literacy, science literacy or mathematics literacy," Paul Logan, deputy director of communications, said in an email. "The governor believes that every year we lag behind other countries in education is a year in which we are slipping in our ability to compete for the jobs of the 21st century." Our ruling McDonnell said that "when it comes to educating our young people, America is slipping" in worldwide rankings. The international test results he referred to have been administered every three years since 2000. There’s a tiny element of truth to McDonnell’s claim: America’s math standing dipped last decade when compared with other nations in the OECD. But even that overlooks the fact that U.S. math scores, after a mid-decade drop, rebounded in 2009, when the last test results were published. And when all countries that took the exam in 2009 are considered, the U.S. ranked in the top half in math for the first time. McDonnell ignored critical facts that paint a different picture of America’s performance. During the last decade, the U.S. edged up in the rankings on reading and remained at the 50th percentile in science among OECD nations. "Slipping" implies lower scores and rankings. That’s not the case. The U.S. has never ranked near the top in education test scores and, with a possible exception for math, has not lost ground to other countries. We rate McDonnell’s claim Mostly False.	None	Bob McDonnell	None	None	None	2013-02-08T15:27:09	2013-01-09	['United_States']
pomt-13584	"While introducing Donald Trump, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani omitted the September 11, 2001, strikes as a ‘successful’ terrorist attack during the eight years before President Obama’s 2008 election."	true	/california/statements/2016/aug/18/john-burton/top-california-democrat-seizes-911-omission-donald/	California Democratic Party Chairman John Burton seized on a major gaffe this week by former New York City mayor and Donald Trump backer Rudy Giuliani. Giuliani, as he introduced Trump during an August 15 speech in Ohio, claimed radical Islamic terror attacks started in the United States under President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and not under President George W. Bush. "By the way, under those eight years before Obama came along, we didn’t have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attack in the United States," Giuliani said. "They all started when Clinton and Obama got into office." Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani speaks at a rally for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.​ He makes his omission at the 1:00 minute mark. PolitiFact, citing the huge omission of the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, rated Giuliani’s claim False. Burton jumped on Giuliani’s statement a day later, saying: "Yesterday while introducing Donald Trump, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani omitted the September 11, 2001, strikes as a ‘successful’ terrorist attack during the eight years before President Obama’s 2008 election. Mayor Giuliani must be spending so much time with Trump that he’s unable to tell truth from fiction." We are relying on the national PolitiFact team’s reporting below to examine the accuracy of the portion of Burton’s statement about Giuliani’s major omission, which appears unassailable. Giuliani’s omission Giuliani, warming up the crowd for Trump’s counter-terrorism speech, appeared to forget one of the defining moments of modern U.S. history and his own political career: the Sept. 11 attacks. The Republican former mayor of New York City during 9/11 was widely lampooned (following the omission) for suggesting that terrorist attacks on U.S. soil were unique to Barack Obama’s presidency. But many media reports left out the beginning of his speech, when he talked at length about 9/11. He recounted how it was the "worst foreign attack in our history since the War of 1812" and how Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence, visited "Ground Zero when we were in desperate need of help." Still, Giuliani seemed to throw everything he had just said out the window: "By the way, under those eight years before Obama came along, we didn’t have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attack in the United States. They all started when Clinton and Obama got into office." Back in 2010, Giuliani made a similar gaffe when he claimed, "We had no domestic attacks under (President George W.) Bush." He later apologized for misspeaking and not adding the words, "since Sept. 11." Giuliani apparently made the same mistake again, telling the New York Daily News that he was just using "abbreviated language." But even barring 9/11, Giuliani is omitting several successful attacks on U.S. soil. Some are undoubtedly jihad-linked while the connection to "radical Islamic extremism" is murkier in others. The New America Foundation, for example, compiles a comprehensive list of terrorist plots, but its definition of "violent jihadist attacks" does not necessarily match up with law enforcement classification. That’s because strict definitions like "hate crime" or "terrorist attack" may be useful for prosecuting cases, but they may cloud the public’s understanding of what the attack was and what motivated the crimes — "questions to which answers are rarely linear or packaged into a neat explanation," said Albert Ford, a research assistant at New America. That being said, let’s go through successful attacks on U.S. soil in which ideology played some role. 2002 Los Angeles Airport shooting On July 4, 2002, Hesham Mohamed Hadayet opened fire at Los Angeles International Airport, killing two and injuring four. Hadayet, a 41-year-old Egyptian national, died after being shot by an airport security guard. Prior to his immigration to the United States, Egyptian authorities accused him of belonging to the terrorist organization, Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya (though he denied this charge). The FBI concluded that Hadayet’s killing spree was a terrorist act, but he acted alone and hoped to influence U.S. government policy toward Palestine. 2002 Beltway snipers In October 2002, John Allen Muhammad and his accomplice, 17-year-old Lee Boyd Malvo, randomly gunned down 10 people in Washington. They were arrested by police and SWAT officers on Oct. 24. The snipers’ motives were myriad. Malvo drew sketches depicting his acts as jihad and testified that Muhammad, a member of the Nation of Islam, lectured him on the religion. He also said Muhammad wanted to start a revolution over "the continued oppression of black people." A Virginia court found Muhammad guilty of engaging in an act of terrorism, and the incident is listed as a major terrorism case on the FBI’s website. Muhammad was executed in 2009 and Malvo is currently serving a life sentence. 2006 Seattle Jewish Federation shooting On July 28, 2006, Naveed Afzal Haq killed one woman and injured five others at the Jewish Federation of Greater Seattle. A witness told the Associated Press that Haq declared himself "a Muslim American, angry at Israel" before opening fire. FBI officials said he was not acting part of a terrorist group, but "acting out some kind of antagonism toward this particular organization." The attack was ultimately classified as a hate crime by the county prosecutor. In 2014, however, the City of Seattle included the shooting as an example of an incident that fits "into the terrorist mold" while the New America Foundation lists it as a "violent jihadist attack," because Haq claimed to be motivated by opposition to U.S. actions. 2006 University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill attack In March 2006, UNC graduate Mohammad Reza Taheri-azar drove an SUV onto campus, injuring nine pedestrians. He turned himself in following the attack and sent several letters to UNC’s student newspaper from jail declaring his intentions to exact revenge for Muslims. "I was aiming to follow in the footsteps of one of my role models, Mohammad Atta, one of the 9/11/01 hijackers, who obtained a doctorate degree," he wrote in one letter. UNC students were divided over whether Taheri-azar’s actions constituted an act of terror. The FBI declined to comment on whether it was investigating links to terrorism, the New York Times reported in 2006. PolitiFact’s ruling on Giuliani’s claim Moments after mentioning 9/11, Giuliani said, "Under those eight years before Obama came along, we didn’t have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attack in the United States." Since then, there have been four successful plots on U.S. soil that were declared by the FBI to be terrorist attacks or whose perpetrators claimed to be motivated by ideology or anti-U.S. sentiments. Reasonable people can disagree over the definition of jihad-inspired terrorism, but Giuliani is taking things too far by omitting all of them. We rate his claim False. PolitiFact California’s ruling on Burton’s claim California Democratic Party Chairman John Burton said Giuliani omitted the 9/11 attacks as "a ‘successful’ terrorist attack during the eight years before President Obama’s 2008 election." Giuliani’s remarks were captured on video and clearly show he left out the 9/11 attacks. Based on this video and PolitiFact’s reporting about terror attacks that took place under President Bush, including 9/11, we rate Burton’s claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-09881	Only 15 percent of drug users are African-American, yet 74 percent of all drug offenders sentenced to prison are black	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/28/arianna-huffington/arianna-huffington-calls-drug-imprisonment-rates-b/	In another example of how the arrest of African-American scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. has driven pundits to talk about issues of race and crime, Arianna Huffington, the founder of the liberal Huffington Post news Web site, offered some statistics about race, drug use and incarceration during a July 26, 2009, roundtable on ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos . Huffington said, "It is really stunning that only 15 percent of the total drug population — drug offending population is African-American. And yet you have 74 percent of them who wind up in jail." A staffer for Huffington clarified her point: African-Americans make up 15 percent of drug users, but 74 percent of drug offenders sentenced to prison. Her comment echoed longstanding calls by critics of U.S. drug policy and criminal sentencing guidelines. These critics have argued that blacks are unfairly targeted by U.S. drug laws as well as the ways those laws are enforced. So we decided to dig into Huffington’s numbers to see if they were correct. An aide to Huffington said her numbers came from a 2006 ACLU report, "Cracks in the System: Twenty Years of the Unjust Federal Crack Cocaine Law," and she did indeed report the numbers correctly from that study. The ACLU, in turn, footnoted those numbers to a fact sheet posted by a group called the Interfaith Drug Policy Initiative. When we checked that group’s Web site, however, we could not find any further footnoting for the statistics. So we decided to look at the raw federal data ourselves. To determine whether blacks account for 15 percent of drug users, we first turned to the 2005 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, released by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services. That study is considered the most reliable in the field, though experts say it probably undercounts harder-core addicts who cannot be reached by survey takers. Among other things, the study quantifies the rates of illicit drug use by different racial and ethnic groups. The drugs studied include marijuana, cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens and inhalants, as well as the nonmedical use of prescription drugs. The numbers do not include tobacco or alcohol. According to the survey, 9.7 percent of blacks, 8.1 percent of whites and 7.6 percent of Hispanics reported using illicit drugs within the prior month. To convert these figures into something comparable to what Huffington said, we cross-referenced these drug-use rates to the current populations of each ethnic group, according to the Census Bureau. Our calculations showed that 70 percent of drug users are white, 14 percent are black and 13 percent are Hispanic. On this fact, then, Huffington was very, very close. She wasn’t as accurate, however, on the second half of her assertion, that 74 percent of all drug offenders sentenced to prison are black. To verify her number, we turned to "Prisoners in 2007," a report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, which is the statistical arm of the U.S. Department of Justice. That report offered estimated figures for offenders sentenced to state prison for drug violations: 113,500 blacks, 72,300 whites and 51,100 Hispanics. On a percentage basis, this means that 29 percent of inmates for drug offenses were white, 20 percent were Hispanic and 45 percent were black — well under the 74 percent level asserted by Huffington. In the federal system, the percentages are lower still for African-Americans. According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, for fiscal year 2008, there were 25,273 federal sentences for drug offenses. Of that number, African-American prisoners didn’t even account for the highest percentage among the three biggest groups. Hispanics led with 40 percent, followed by blacks at 31 percent and whites at 25 percent. One drug policy expert we contacted, Beau Kilmer of the RAND Corp., said our calculations were sound, though he added that Huffington’s comparison of drug use and incarceration has some logical holes. "We have to realize most drug use is marijuana, and that’s not the reason why people are going to prison — it’s the harder drugs," Kilmer said. Ultimately, Huffington was right about one number and quite a bit off with the other. However, even at the much lower rates of incarceration we found, black Americans — who account for about 13 percent of the U.S. population — are still imprisoned for drug offenses at wildly disproportionate rates. So we rate this statement Half True.	None	Arianna Huffington	None	None	None	2009-07-28T17:51:27	2009-07-26	['None']
pomt-08264	Grocery prices "have risen significantly over the past year or so."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/nov/10/sarah-palin/whos-right-food-inflation-sarah-palin-or-wall-stre/	Almost anything Sarah Palin says on her Facebook page draws attention -- especially if someone thinks she's got it wrong. And that's exactly what's happened in the past few days. It all began Nov. 7, 2010, when the National Review Online published an advance version of a keynote address Palin was preparing to give to a trade-association convention in Phoenix. Her comments were pegged to the Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors economic summit in South Korea, at which a central point of discussion was expected to be a Federal Reserve bond-buying proposal called "quantitative easing," or "QE2" for short. Palin warned that the U.S., specifically Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, "shouldn't be playing around with inflation." She explained part of her reasoning this way: "All this pump priming (by the Fed) will come at a serious price. And I mean that literally: Everyone who ever goes out shopping for groceries knows that prices have risen significantly over the past year or so. Pump priming would push them even higher." This triggered a response from an economics blogger at the Wall Street Journal, Sudeep Reddy. In a Nov. 8, 2010, blog post, Reddy wrote that inflation generally, and food inflation specifically, are actually quite low right now. Here's part of what Reddy wrote: "Grocery prices haven't risen all that significantly, in fact. The Consumer Price Index's measure of food and beverages for the first nine months of this year showed average annual inflation of less than 0.6 percent, the slowest pace on record (since the Labor Department started keeping this measure in 1968). Even if you pick a single snapshot — say, September's year-over-year increase in prices — that was just 1.4 percent, far better than the 6 percent annual increase for food prices recorded in September 2008. "The overall consumer price index was up 1.1 percent in September from a year earlier. Apart from September 2009 (when prices were down 1.3 percent), that was the slowest annual inflation rate for September since the early 1960s. That's not strong evidence to argue about rising prices today." The same day, Palin fired back via Facebook. She titled her post, "Do Wall Street Journal Reporters Read the Wall Street Journal?" "Really?" Palin wrote. "That's odd, because just last Thursday, November 4, I read an article in Mr. Reddy's own Wall Street Journal titled 'Food Sellers Grit Teeth, Raise Prices: Packagers and Supermarkets Pressured to Pass Along Rising Costs, Even as Consumers Pinch Pennies.' The article noted that 'an inflationary tide is beginning to ripple through America's supermarkets and restaurants. … Prices of staples including milk, beef, coffee, cocoa and sugar have risen sharply in recent months.' Now I realize I'm just a former governor and current housewife from Alaska, but even humble folks like me can read the newspaper. I'm surprised a prestigious reporter for the Wall Street Journal doesn't." Ouch. So, on Nov. 9, Reddy replied to Palin in another blog post. Reddy reiterated the statistics he had cited earlier, then added some additional detail. "While some items in the shopping cart have risen in price (ground chuck beef is up 4.8%) and others have decreased (bananas are down 5.3%), overall food price inflation has been historically low for the past year. This is not surprising. Weak demand, high unemployment and thrifty shoppers have led retailers to keep many prices from rising despite the rising cost of some commodities, including coffee and sugar. The Nov. 4 Wall Street Journal article noted, in its first sentence, 'the tamest year of food pricing in nearly two decades.' It does indeed report that supermarkets and restaurants are facing cost pressures that could push their retail prices higher -- but it hasn't happened yet on a large scale. Critics of the Fed's quantitative easing policy are focused primarily on concerns about potential future inflation." Clearly, sorting all this out sounds like a job for PolitiFact. We first turned to the Consumer Price Index, or CPI, the most widely used statistic to measure inflation. During the 12-month period ending in September 2010, we found that the CPI showed food costs rising 1.4 percent -- exactly as Reddy said they did. For some historical context, we also looked back a couple years. We found that for the year ending in September 2009, food prices dropped two-tenths of 1 percent; for the year ending in September 2008, food prices rose by 6 percent; and for the year ending in September 2007, food prices rose by 4.4 percent. So 2009 and 2010 have indeed been years of relatively low inflation for food. (Here's a chart Reddy provided us showing some of the data he used.) In the meantime, we also looked at additional data. One database we used comes from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a division of the U.S. Commerce Department. BEA produces a table that shows monthly, quarterly and annual prices for consumer products. One of the categories BEA tracks is food. (The differences between the data sets we used are of interest only to deep-in-the-weeds statisticians; we'll just say that all the databases cited here are considered trustworthy.) We compared food prices in the first quarter of 2009 with food prices in the first quarter of 2010 and found that they had declined 0.9 percent during that period. Making the same comparison for the second quarter of both years showed an increase of 0.2 percent, and a comparison for the third quarter showed an increase of 0.9 percent. These sounded like modest increases to us, but we confirmed that by comparing them to the historical trends in BEA's data. Looking at the past decade of year-to-year price changes, we found that annual food inflation averaged about 2.7 percent a year. The annual increases varied from 1.3 percent to 6 percent. In other words, so far so good for Reddy's critique of Palin: We found no sign that grocery prices "have risen significantly over the past year or so." Still, there are two other points worth making. One point (also mentioned by Reddy) is that certain grocery items increased faster than others -- and that included some staples. CPI data showed that the price of butter increased by 19.1 percent during the 12 months ended Sept. 30, 2010, while the price of bacon rose by 15.7 percent, lamb increased by 9.4 percent and milk increased by 8.3 percent. Meanwhile, BEA statistics show that certain broad food categories rose faster than the food-sector average: a 3.4 percent increase for meats and poultry, a 3.4 percent bump for milk, dairy products and eggs; and a 2.8 percent hike for sweets and sugar. All of these items, in other words, rose a whole lot faster than food inflation generally. And it's simply human nature for a consumer to feel like prices are rising quickly if you have to pay increases like that every time you enter the checkout line. As long as you're paying through the nose for milk, the brain tends to forget that the dried lentils you just bought are down 5.5 percent, and the peanut butter you just bought is down 5.1 percent. The second point is that even if food prices are flat or rising slightly, Americans are living through a period of stagnating or contracting incomes, which means even slowly rising prices hurt. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service assembles a table detailing "food expenditures by families and individuals as a share of disposable personal money income." The table essentially shows what percentage of their income families are paying for food. In total, Americans tend to spend about 11 percent to 12 percent of their income on food, with a small majority spent on food at home and the rest spent at restaurants. Over the last three years, the food-at-home portion of that spending -- the only part relevant for judging Palin's statement -- rose from 6.4 percent in 2007 to 6.5 percent in 2008 to 6.8 percent in 2009. The reason that families are paying a larger share of disposable income for food had little to do with food prices and a lot to do with contracting incomes. For the first time since at least 1959, "disposable personal money income" dropped between 2008 and 2009, by 1.3 percent. Because food is more of a necessity than many other consumer items, that budget line ended up taking a larger share of many families' shrinking incomes. Neither of these two factors support Palin's claim that grocery prices "have risen significantly over the past year or so." Strictly speaking, grocery prices have generally risen at historically sluggish rates during the period Palin is talking about. However, important food categories, including meat and dairy products, have risen at much faster rates. And in a time of shrinking family incomes, Americans are indeed paying slightly more for food as a percentage of their income. These two additional pieces of information make Palin's observation about grocery prices understandable, even if it isn't borne out in the most widely tracked statistics. So we rate her statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05340	"When we took office, let me remind you, there was virtually no international pressure on Iran."	false	/georgia/statements/2012/may/14/joe-biden/biden-obama-exerting-more-pressure-against-iran/	Vice President Joe Biden has been making a lot of news lately and his recent visit to the Atlanta area was no exception. Biden came to Sandy Springs to give a speech at the national convention of the Rabbinical Assembly, an influential group of about 1,600 rabbis. The Middle East, of course, was a main topic of the vice president’s speech. In particular, Iran, a perennial threat to stability in the region. "When we took office, let me remind you, there was virtually no international pressure on Iran," Biden said. "We were the problem." Some conservatives, who accuse the Obama administration of being apologists for America, responded quickly to Biden’s line that "we were the problem" -- an apparent shot at George W. Bush’s administration. One writer for the right-leaning National Review wrote an article arguing the vice president was wrong about the lack of international pressure on Iran prior to Democrat Barack Obama becoming president in 2009. "[T]hroughout President Bush’s final year in office, diplomatic efforts generated new levels of pressure on Tehran," the Review article reported, referring to the Iranian capital. So who’s right here? Bush, a Republican, was worried about Iran, but his attention in the Middle East was primarily focused on Iraq and Afghanistan, countries where he ordered U.S. troops in military conflict. Obama has made ending combat in Afghanistan and Iraq among his top policies in the region. He’s also turned up the heat on Iran, which is said to be on the verge of developing nuclear weapons. Since 2010, the United States and most of the world’s leading powers have approved several sanctions on Iran. Economic data on Iran is difficult to find, but there is consensus that United Nations sanctions and other forms of punishment are making an impact. The international pressure on Iran includes: an expanded arms embargo. tighter sanctions on groups and individuals associated with the Iranian nuclear program. banning Iran from any activities related to ballistic missiles. a European Union embargo on Iranian oil. According to U.S. Treasury and State Department officials, at least 80 major banks had committed not to finance exports to Iran or to process dollar transactions for Iranian banks. China and Russia, world powers who sometimes stray from the U.S.A.’s international game plan, have participated in varying degrees on pressuring Iran. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said in late 2011 before Parliament that the current sanctions campaign was "the heaviest economic onslaught on a nation in history." Okay, it appears the world is making life more difficult for the Iranian regime in the last two years. But what about Biden’s argument that the international community wasn’t as tough on Tehran before Obama took office. Kyle Beardsley, an Emory University assistant professor with vast expertise on such matters, pointed out that as the National Review said, there were several United Nations resolutions against Iran during the latter years of the Bush administration. The U.N. efforts during the Bush years included: Resolution 1737, passed in 2006, which banned trade with Iran in all items, materials, equipment, goods and technology that could contribute to the country’s development of nuclear-weapon delivery systems. Resolution 1747, adopted in 2007, which banned the country’s arms exports and restricted the travel of additional individuals engaged in Iran’s nuclear activities. Resolution 1803, approved in 2008, which froze the assets of people involved in the nuclear program. He did add that the Obama administration has tried to apply more pressure on Iran because there is greater willingness on the part of Europe and other key states to implement tougher sanctions. "It is true that multiple Security Council resolutions were passed during the Bush administration, but they only targeted specific individuals and companies involved in the Iranian nuclear program," Beardsley, whose research includes the influence of U.N. Security Council resolutions, told us via email. "In contrast, U.N. Resolution 1929 (2010) imposes more general sanctions on Iranian arms, and the E.U. decided this year to impose an embargo on Iranian oil. A number of other countries have also increased their own bilateral sanctions against Iran in recent years." Biden would have had a strong case for high marks on the Truth-O-Meter if he said what appeared to be his main point: the Obama administration has prodded the rest of the world to be tougher on Iran. But there is a disconnect with what the vice president actually said and U.N. resolutions passed against Iran during the Bush administration. The resolutions seem to be a little more than "virtually no international pressure on Iran." We rate Biden’s statement False.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2012-05-14T06:00:00	2012-05-08	['Iran']
pomt-01374	Says Charlie Crist "voted against minimum wage when he was in the Senate."	false	/florida/statements/2014/oct/16/rick-scott/scott-accuses-crist-voting-against-minimum-wage-hi/	Gov. Rick Scott was sure to bring allegations that Charlie Crist has changed positions to Wednesday night’s debate in Davie, including the new Democrat’s stance on raising the minimum wage. After former Gov. Crist said he supported raising the minimum wage to $10.10, echoing a plan by President Barack Obama, Scott attacked the newly minted Democrat. "He voted against minimum wage when he was in the Senate," Scott said. "He didn’t think it was the right thing to do, so he voted against it." We’ve looked into Crist’s record before on the minimum wage. There’s some evidence that earlier in his career, Crist opposed raising the minimum wage. But there’s no evidence to show that Crist voted on the minimum wage when he was a state legislator. When the Republican Party of Florida accused Crist earlier this summer of voting against a minimum wage increase, he said that wasn’t so. "I haven’t taken a vote since 1998," he told us then. That year was the tail end of his term in the state Senate, a seat he won in 1992. The GOP told us a commercial it had run attacking Crist for a vote against raising the minimum wage was referring to 2004, when Crist was attorney general. That year, Florida voted in favor of a ballot initiative to raise the minimum wage by $1, to $6.15 an hour. Before then, there was no state minimum wage, only the federally mandated minimum. After the measure passed, the state’s minimum wage went up and was tied to inflation. This year it went up 14 cents an hour and is now $7.93. As attorney general, Crist had no say about whether the measure passed or not. But he also was a board member of the state’s public-private economic development agency Enterprise Florida, which did take a position on the minimum wage. Meeting minutes showed that on Aug. 19, 2004, the board held a teleconference in which members voted unanimously to oppose the minimum wage increase. The voice vote was a statement of principle and was not binding. Attorney General Crist was present at the meeting. Crist barely mentioned the issue until this year, and there is no record it has come up before now. Crist's campaign did not have any response to Scott's statement about Crist taking a Senate vote on the minimum wage. Karen Woodall, executive director of the Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy, said there had been voting on the minimum wage in the House while Crist was in the Senate, but there were no votes in the Senate. Miami Beach Democrat Jack Gordon had filed a bill in 1992, but that fight ended before Crist was elected. Another bill was filed in 1994 by Howard Forman, D-Hollywood, but it died in committee with no action taken. The House filed a bill with no Senate companion in 1997, but that also failed. The Scott campaign did not clarify Scott’s response, instead pointing out the 2004 vote. With no evidence the issue came up during Crist’s Senate term, it’s possible the governor meant the 2004 voice vote for Enterprise Florida. There’s no evidence of any Senate action between 1993 and 1999, when Crist was there. Our ruling Scott said Crist "voted against minimum wage when he was in the Senate." Crist served on the board of Enterprise Florida when the group opposed an increase to Florida’s minimum wage in 2004. At the time, he was attorney general. But there’s no evidence that Crist ever voted on minimum wage legislation as a state senator. It’s entirely possible Scott misspoke, but there’s no evidence of any such vote during Sen. Crist’s term. We rate the statement False.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2014-10-16T16:12:19	2014-10-15	['Charlie_Crist']
pomt-15269	"The top one-tenth of 1 percent" of Americans "own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jul/29/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-madison-claims-top-01-americans-hav/	A month after launching his long-shot bid for the White House, a 73-year-old senator from Vermont appeared in Madison before perhaps the largest gathering for any candidate to that point in the 2016 campaign. Bernie Sanders called for a political revolution against greed and took jabs at Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a contender on the GOP side of the field. Cheering him on was an Alliant Energy Center crowd that his aides estimated at nearly 10,000 people. At one point during his hourlong speech on July 1, 2015, Sanders said: "The issue of wealth and income inequality, to my mind, is the great moral issue of our time. It is the great economic issue of our time and it is the great political issue of our time. "Let me be as clear as I can be: There is something profoundly wrong when today, the top one-tenth of 1 percent own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent." Wealth inequality is sure to be an issue Sanders emphasizes as he challenges Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. So, does the top one-tenth of 1 percent of Americans own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent? Previous claims Two of our most-clicked fact checks have found significant gaps in wealth in the United States. Filmmaker Michael Moore -- also speaking in Madison, during the height of protests against Walker over his collective bargaining reforms in 2011 -- said 400 Americans have more wealth than half of all Americans combined. Our rating was True. As of 2010, the net worth of the Forbes 400 -- $1.37 trillion -- exceeded that of the poorest 60 percent of U.S. households. We also rated True a 2013 statement by the liberal One Wisconsin Now advocacy group, which said the wealth of the Wal-Mart Walton family equalled the wealth of the bottom 42 percent of Americans combined. The wealth of Sam Walton’s heirs, we found, was $89.5 billion -- equal to the bottom 42 percent of American families. A note about those fact checks, in terms of helping explain the wealth gap: Many Americans make a good income, have some savings and investments, and own a nice home; they also have debt, for a mortgage, credit cards and other bills. Some people would still have a pretty healthy bottom line, but still have a negative net worth. Meanwhile, so far in 2015, PolitiFact National has given Sanders a Mostly True for saying income equality in the U.S. is the widest since the 1920s; and a Mostly True for saying 99 percent of all new income is "going to the top 1 percent." Now to his new claim, which is about wealth, rather than income. Sanders’ evidence To back Sanders’ statement, his Senate office cited a news article from The Guardian newspaper. The headline on the article, which reported on a wealth inequality study released in October 2014, matched Sanders’ claim nearly word for word. The study was done for the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonpartisan organization in Cambridge, Mass. It is perhaps best known as the arbiter for determining whether the U.S. economy is in recession. The authors of the study were economists Emmanuel Saez of the University of California, Berkeley, and Gabriel Zucman of the London School of Economics. Using tax records, they made estimates for 2012 on wealth -- that is, the value of all assets, such as a home, and savings and retirement accounts, minus all debts, such as mortgages and credit card balances. The major finding, in terms of Sanders’ claim: The top 0.1 percent was composed of 160,000 families with average wealth of $72.8 million. All told, they owned 22 percent of the nation’s wealth. Meanwhile, the bottom 90 percent -- 144 million families with average wealth of $84,000 -- owned only 22.8 percent of the wealth. In other words, the top 0.1 percent and the bottom 90 percent of U.S. households own virtually the same share of all the nation's wealth. "Wealth is getting more concentrated in the United States," the researchers observed, "but this phenomenon largely owes to the spectacular dynamics of fortunes of dozens and hundreds of million dollars, and much less to the growth in fortunes of a few million dollars. Inequality within rich families is increasing." Two other prominent economists -- Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics and Edward Wolff of New York University -- told us that the study makes solid estimates about wealth inequality. Wolff said he was not aware of another study that examined the wealth of the top 0.1 percent. But some fault the findings to some degree. Another view Richard Burkhauser, a professor of policy analysis at Cornell University, told us that Saez and Zucman are "very well respected economists," but that he has a major complaint about their study: it excludes Social Security. "To ignore it as they do grossly understates the wealth held by Americans in the bottom 99 percent of the population," Burkhauser said. Another criticism is the study that it doesn't take into account changes in tax laws. Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, pointed us to an article one of his colleagues wrote in the Wall Street Journal. It said, for example, that changes in tax laws in the 1980s and ’90s skew any increase in wealth inequality by requiring more capital income of high-income taxpayers be reported on individual returns, while excluding most capital income of middle-income savers and homeowners. Mitchell told us: "Even if one makes the heroic assumption that the data is completely accurate, our friends on the left take these numbers and want people to believe that the wealth of the top 1 percent (or top 10 percent, or top .01 percent, etc) comes at the expense of the rest of us. This is generally nonsense. People such as Bill Gates become rich because they generate real value for others. There is no fixed pie." Our rating Sanders said "the top one-tenth of 1 percent" of Americans "own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent." His claim repeats a finding from a study by two internationally known economists that were supported by two other major economists we contacted. But the study has been criticized, for example, for not including Social Security in the wealth calculations. For a claim that is accurate but needs additional information, a rating is Mostly True.

pomt-01284	Says Scott Brown "voted to reward" companies "to ship jobs overseas."	half-true	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/oct/31/jeanne-shaheen/jeanne-shaheen-says-scott-brown-voted-reward-compa/	Everywhere they go, Jeanne Shaheen and Scott Brown each tout their own record of supporting businesses. It’s been a familiar topic on the campaign trail, in TV ads and during debates in one of the most-watched Senate races in the country. During their first of three televised debates on Oct. 24, 2014, Shaheen, the Democrat, took it to the Republican Brown, saying he voted to give tax breaks to companies that move jobs overseas. "One of the problems with our tax code is we encourage companies to outsource our jobs. We actually provide tax credits for companies that ship jobs overseas," Shaheen said directly to Brown. "When you were in the senate, you voted to reward those companies to ship jobs overseas." Brown had a definitive response: "I have never voted to outsource jobs." The exchange sounded like a job for PolitiFact. In this item, we will look into Shaheen’s claim that Brown "voted to reward" companies to ship jobs overseas. As evidence, the Shaheen campaign pointed to Brown’s vote on a 2010 bill introduced by Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., called the Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act (S. 3816). The bill aimed to give companies incentives to bring overseas jobs back to the U.S. and to reduce tax breaks that companies can benefit from when moving jobs outside of the country, according to a summary of the legislation by the Library of Congress. In some cases, the 2010 measure would have taken away a firm's option to defer taxes on profits from goods made overseas but sold here. The bill drew opposition from major businesses and industry groups as well, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Koch Industries, both of whom registered to lobby on the bill. "S. 3816 would create a payroll tax holiday for employers moving jobs to the United States from overseas in a purported attempt to stimulate job growth," wrote R. Bruce Josten, the executive vice president of government affairs for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which now endorses Brown in the race. "However, the concept of economic growth is not a zero-sum game. Replacing a job that is based in another country with a domestic job does not stimulate economic growth or enhance the competitiveness of American worldwide companies." PolitiFact previously checked a claim by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., a co-sponsor of S.3816, who said the country’s tax code allows companies to deduct the expense of moving jobs overseas. That statement was found to be true. Shaheen voted yes, and Brown voted "no." However, he’s got some cover. First, while the intention of the Durbin bill was "to create American jobs and to prevent the offshoring of such jobs overseas," it never came to an up or down vote. The bill died on a procedural vote to end debate, known as cloture. It gained only 53 of the 60 votes required to shut down debate and move to a final, up-or-down vote. Senators voted mostly along party lines: 52 of 57 Democrats voted yes (one didn't cast a vote), and 40 of 41 Republicans voted no (with one not casting vote). The chamber’s two independents were split. So Brown never cast a vote on the merits of the measure. However, Brown openly criticized the bill on Sept. 27, 2010 -- the day before the Senate vote -- saying it would hurt job creation and harm the economy. "Mr. President, this bill on the floor tonight is not about job creation. It’s about the campaign and November," he said at the time. "They want to call us the party of ‘No’– I get it. Some pollster says that it plays well back home when politicians talk about ‘companies that ship jobs overseas.’ I get that too." He added, "Major employers in Massachusetts that I’ve talked to have said that these proposals are like getting a small piece of candy with one hand and hit with a sledge hammer with the other." The second bit of cover for Brown is that Shaheen exaggerates somewhat when she says that Brown "voted to reward" companies "to ship jobs overseas." As we’ve noted previously, there is no tax break or loophole that addresses outsourcing or insourcing jobs specifically. When Democrats refer to "tax breaks" for outsourcing, they are typically referring to standard business expense deductions. Companies can write off many business-related expenses as tax-deductible -- including relocation. This provision of tax law isn’t targeted at businesses that move outside of the United States. A business would get the same deductions for money spent moving from New York to California. Our ruling Jeanne Shaheen says Scott Brown voted to reward companies to ship jobs overseas. A bill in the Senate in 2010 called the Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act was aimed at giving companies incentives to bring overseas jobs back to the United States and reducing tax breaks that can benefit companies that move jobs outside of the country. On a procedural vote to move the bill forward, Shaheen voted in favor and Brown against. Brown did openly oppose the bill in a speech, but his actual vote was procedural -- not on the merits -- and it’s debatable whether his opposition amounted to "rewarding" companies that outsource or simply kept a status quo that treated all companies equally. On balance, we find Shaheen’s statement Half True.	None	Jeanne Shaheen	None	None	None	2014-10-31T16:28:07	2014-10-21	['None']
pomt-05710	Says the proposed fiscal year 2013 budget "is still below the level of state spending when I took office."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/mar/08/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-proposed-budget-smaller-leve/	Gov. Chris Christie wants to increase state spending in the coming fiscal year, but he claims the proposed budget is smaller than the one in place when he took office in January 2010. The governor made that point in a Feb. 21 speech before state legislators and other officials, when he unveiled his proposed $32.1 billion budget for fiscal year 2013, which begins July 1. The adjusted budget for the current fiscal year stands at roughly $30.9 billion. "The budget I propose would total $32.1 billion for the coming year," Christie said. "While this represents minimal growth from last year, it is still below the level of state spending when I took office." PolitiFact New Jersey was interested in whether state spending was higher two years ago, and a state Treasury Department spokesman showed us the numbers that back up Christie’s claim. The proposed fiscal year 2013 budget is smaller than the fiscal year 2010 budget in place around the time Christie took office -- but just barely. The difference between the two budgets is about $5 million. Let’s break down the numbers. Christie, a Republican, was sworn into office on Jan. 19, 2010 -- in the middle of fiscal year 2010, which began under former Gov. Jon Corzine, a Democrat. Two months later, the new governor introduced his budget for fiscal year 2011. To support the governor’s statement, Treasury spokesman Andrew Pratt pointed out how the fiscal year 2010 budget when Christie took office was $32.151 billion. That figure represented the adjusted budget as of March 16, 2010, according to a Treasury report at the time. The governor’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2013 is $32.146 billion, according to a recent budget summary. "As such, his statement is true," Pratt told us. So, the proposed budget is roughly $5 million less than the "level of state spending" when Christie took office, marking a decrease of 0.016 percent. That’s not a lot of money, but it still means Christie’s statement is correct. But there’s a major reason for why the fiscal year 2010 budget was larger than the proposed budget for fiscal year 2013: federal stimulus dollars. That adjusted budget of $32.151 billion for fiscal year 2010 included $2.289 billion worth of appropriations supported by stimulus funds. Those stimulus funds were used to help close a projected budget shortfall. Without those stimulus dollars, the proposed budget for fiscal year 2013 would be larger than the budget in place when Christie took office. Our ruling In his Feb. 21 budget speech, Christie claimed in regard to his proposed fiscal year 2013 budget: "While this represents minimal growth from last year, it is still below the level of state spending when I took office." According to state Treasury documents, Christie is accurate. The proposed budget is $32.146 billion -- about $5 million less than the $32.151 billion spending plan in place when Christie took office.

pomt-09778	On whether the governor of Massachusetts should be able to appoint an interim U.S. senator	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/24/massachusetts-legislature/massachusetts-legislature-flip-flops-governors-sen/	We've never put an entire legislature to the Flip-O-Meter before. But the recent move by the Massachusetts legislature in filling the seat held by the late Sen. Edward Kennedy was too bold to pass up. Massachusetts legislators this week approved a bill that allows the governor to appoint a temporary successor to Kennedy. But that came just over five years after legislators stripped the governor's longstanding power to appoint a U.S. senator to fill a vacancy. Both moves were consistent in one sense: In the strongly Democratic state, they advanced the Democratic Party's interests. But the two actions amount to a resounding flip-flop. In 2004, the state's junior senator, John Kerry, was the Democratic presidential nominee. Party leaders knew that if Kerry won in November, state law allowed the governor — then Republican Mitt Romney — to appoint Kerry's successor, and that person would presumably be a Republican. So, the Democratic leadership of the legislature drew up a measure to strip the governor of his senatorial appointment power. Under this bill, a special election would be held between 145 and 160 days after the incumbent senator left office. Until that special election was held, the seat would be vacant, and the governor would be unable to appoint an interim senator, something the governor had the right to do previously. The measure passed both chambers and was vetoed by Romney. The Democrats then muscled a two-thirds majority to override the veto. Of course, Kerry never won the presidency, but the law remained on the books. Fast-forward to 2009. Democrats realized that the law they had enacted in 2004 forced the state to have only one senator for roughly five months — and after Kennedy's death, that meant the state would be short one senator. From a political standpoint, that meant the U.S. Senate would have one less Democrat at a time when a Democratic president was trying to reach a 60-vote threshold to enact landmark legislation on Kennedy's signature issue, health care. And this time, the governor, Deval Patrick, is a Democrat and presumably would appoint someone from his party. So legislators quickly passed legislation that would keep the special election but still allow the governor to appoint an interim senator to serve until the special election. The measure passed both chambers, and on Sept. 24, 2009, Patrick named former Democratic National Committee chairman Paul Kirk, a Kennedy family friend, as the interim senator. To gauge the magnitude of this flip-flop, we looked back at the roll call votes in the state House from 2004 and 2009. (We were unable to locate the Senate roll calls online.) We found 50 state House members who effectively voted in 2004 to keep Kerry's seat in Democratic hands and also voted this month to appoint an interim senator who — no surprise here — ended up being a Democrat. All 50 were Democrats. It's worth pointing out that the votes were not about exactly the same thing. The 2009 vote kept in place the 2004 legislation's provisions on the special election, with both bills ultimately putting the choice for the Senate seat in the hands of the voters. Indeed, if we compared the votes on this basis alone, we might have suggested that the legislature had done a Half Flip. But two factors made the flip-flop more egregious. One was the rhetoric that Democrats used to defend the initial effort to strip gubernatorial appointment power. Many legislators argued that the power to choose U.S. senators ought to reside with the voters, not with one person. For instance, Democratic state Rep. J. James Marzilli Jr. told the Boston Globe in 2004, "It's ridiculous. We choose senators and members of Congress in elections. We shouldn't let politicians make those choices for us." The article added that Marzilli "was unconcerned" about leaving the seat vacant until the special election. "We already have a congressional delegation, and we'll always have at least one member in the United States Senate," he said. Meanwhile, House Speaker Thomas Finneran charged that Romney wanted to name the next senator "in a back room," according to the Boston Herald . He added, "That's reform? Please." And Senate President Robert E. Travaglini said, according to the Globe , "We have always felt that this position is significant enough that no one person should make that determination. It should be decided by the people." (None of the three Democrats were serving in the legislature by 2009.) The second factor that underlined the magnitude of the flip-flop is that Democratic legislative leaders in 2004 specifically rejected an entreaty by Romney to allow the governor to pick a temporary senator. In fact, Romney even offered to let Democratic leaders have a say in whom he picked. As the Globe reported on July 12, 2004, a top aide to Romney unveiled the proposal on the steps of the state Capitol, saying the governor was willing to submit the name of a temporary appointee to the House speaker and the Senate president. That appointee would serve until the special election. (The temporary appointee could run in the special election; Kirk has promised not to.) But in 2004, key Democrats dismissed the governor's proposal. State Sen. Brian Joyce, the Democratic co-chairman of the Election Laws Committee, called it "a clever political ploy." It went nowhere. To be fair, we should note that Republicans also said some things during the 2004 debate that would eventually clash with what they argued in 2009. But we are rating the Massachusetts legislature, which was, and is, controlled by Democrats. So let's recap. Democratic legislators in 2004 sought to take away the power of a (Republican) governor to appoint an interim senator, arguing that doing so would enable the people to take up their rightful responsibility instead. Five years later, many of those same legislators passed a law enabling a (Democratic) governor to name an interim senator — and in doing so, enacted something very similar to what they had rejected when the (Republican) governor proposed it in 2004. We rate this a Full Flop.	None	Massachusetts legislature	None	None	None	2009-09-24T15:44:17	2009-09-22	['United_States', 'Massachusetts']
pomt-12487	"China account(s) for 90 percent of North Korean trade."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/01/rex-tillerson/does-china-account-90-north-korean-trade-rex-tille/	The Trump administration has cited China's trade relationship with North Korea as a key lever to deter the regime from producing a nuclear missile capable of striking the U.S. "We must all do our share," Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told the U.N. Security Council April 28. "But China, accounting for 90 percent of North Korean trade, China alone has economic leverage over Pyongyang that is unique, and its role is therefore particularly important." Tillerson’s remarks, which included a call for fresh economic sanctions, came at a time of heightened tensions between the United States and North Korea. As a U.S. Navy strike group steamed toward the Korean Peninsula -- where 28,500 American troops stationed in South Korea are on alert following the latest provocations from Pyongyang -- President Donald Trump on April 27 warned of a possible "major conflict" if diplomatic efforts fail. We’ve previously looked at Trump’s claim about the degree of control Beijing wields over Pyongyang. With Tillerson citing Chinese-North Korean trade relations as a vital diplomatic pressure point, we decided to explore how much China accounts for North Korea’s overall trade with the outside world. Finding accurate data for the secretive regime is a bit tricky since no North Korean equivalent of Trade.gov with troves of trade data exists, as Pyongyang treats this information as a state secret. But so-called "mirror statistics," an accounting of data reconstructed from other countries’ reports, offer a workaround, albeit a flawed one, since the statistics don’t capture some transactions. The available data tell a story of growing dependence on Chinese trade over roughly the past two decades as economic sanctions levied by the UN and individual countries, as well as other factors, have seen North Korea’s trade with other partners fall drastically. In 2000, China, South Korea and Japan each accounted for about a fifth of the regime's overall trade, with the rest of the world making up the remaining roughly two-fifths. Since then, China’s slice of the pie has more than quadrupled, according to Stephan Haggard, professor of Korea-Pacific Studies at the University of California-San Diego. "As sanctions have reduced South Korean and Japanese trade basically to nothing, trade has naturally become focused more on China," Haggard said. "The rest of the world has not picked up the slack." Marcus Noland of the Peterson Institute for International Economics agreed that China’s current position as an outsize trade partner of North Korea is largely a function of Pyongyang’s strained relations with its neighbor to the south -- but he noted this could change if political winds shift. "The reason that the percentage is so high is that South Korea, which was North Korea’s second largest trade partner, imposed sanctions and trade between the two countries is virtually nil," Noland said. "If South Korea were to resume trade relations (as it might in the next administration) China’s share of North Korean trade would fall, but China would still be the country’s principal trade partner." Bilateral disputes led to Tokyo imposing sanctions that went even further than UN restrictions, said Haggard, who noted that the commercial risk associated with North Korea and its poor record on honoring property rights have also dissuaded potential trade partners. As South Korean and Japanese trade with Pyongyang fell, China’s economy boomed, fueling increased trade with North Korea -- a relationship unfettered by bilateral sanctions, as Beijing has traditionally viewed the regime as an ally. China has also been accused of being less compliant with UN sanctions than other countries. As a result of these factors, the consensus among experts we spoke to is that China now accounts for roughly 90 percent of North Korean trade. Source: Stephan Haggard, professor of Korea-Pacific Studies at the University of California-San Diego. UNSCR refers to United Nations Security Council Resolutions. "Yes, China accounts for more than 90 percent of North Korea’s recorded trade," Noland said. "They are the primary supplier of oil and the marginal supplier of grain. If China wanted to, it could bring North Korea to its knees." "It has the economic leverage, but has been unwilling to use it, perhaps because it fears destabilizing the regime," he added. Our ruling Tillerson said, "China account(s) for 90 percent of North Korean trade." China’s role as an outsize trade partner of North Korea is a relatively new development. Since 2000, trade with the rest of the world has dropped off, as Chinese trade has risen. While the ratio is subject to change based on political factors, China now accounts for around 90 percent of North Korean trade. We rate Tillerson’s statement True.

pomt-14778	"From 2010-2014, median household income" in Wisconsin "has actually gone up 7.4 percent."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/dec/07/scott-walker/ignoring-inflation-scott-walker-says-incomes-rose-/	On the morning of Dec. 3, 2015, Gov. Scott Walker tweeted this from his official Twitter account: "From 2010-2014, median household income has actually gone up 7.4 percent." The word actually seemed to allude to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel news article from the front page of that morning’s newspaper. The headline was: "Household income takes sharp downturn in most of Wisconsin." So, which is it? Have incomes in the Badger State gone up? Or down? Previous claim In July 2015, while pursuing his presidential bid, Walker used his personal Twitter account to say that under his leadership, Wisconsin median household income was up 2.7 percent, while it was down 1.3 percent nationally under President Barack Obama. Our rating was Mostly False. Walker had cited U.S. Census data, usually a gold-standard source. But the data was from the census’ Current Population Survey. That set is good for the national income picture, but less accurate at the state level. The better data is from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, a rolling collection of household and demographic statistics from 3.5 million addresses. Those figures revealed a much different picture than Walker had painted: An income drop nationally, yes -- of 1.72 percent. But also an income drop -- not an increase, as Walker stated -- in Wisconsin of 1.62 percent. So, what about the governor’s claim this time? The news story The Journal Sentinel’s article reported on newly released data from the American Community Survey covering two periods: 2005 to 2009 and 2010 to 2014. Median household income fell by a significant margin in two-thirds of Wisconsin counties during the period. Importantly, the article reported figures that are adjusted for inflation. By the way, think of median household income as the midpoint: Half of Wisconsin households have an income higher than the median, and half have an income that is lower. Walker spokeswoman Laurel Patrick emailed the Journal Sentinel about the article, saying it was distorted because it did not include the 7.4 percent figure Walker cited in his tweet. The Journal Sentinel asked her for the data that produced that figure. What the newspaper found was that Walker used American Community Survey data -- but didn’t properly adjust for inflation. That means he compared 2010 dollars to 2014 dollars, an economic no-no. Whenever you are looking at income, "you should be looking at real income instead of nominal income, which means you adjust for changes," said Abdur Chowdhury, a professor of economics at Marquette University in Milwaukee and former chief economist of the United Nations Economic Commission in Europe. Otherwise, he said, you’re looking at apples and oranges. "$100 today is not the same as $100 last year," Chowdhury said. "If you adjust for price, what you get is the real change in your buying power." For the news article and for this analysis, the Journal Sentinel used the Consumer Price Index from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics to adjust for inflation. Here’s what the adjusted data show: Walker’s method: 2010 Wisconsin median household income -- unadjusted 2014 median household income adjusted for inflation (2014 dollars) Difference $49,001 $52,622 7.4% increase After adjusting for inflation: 2010 Wisconsin median household income -- adjusted for inflation 2014 median household income adjusted for inflation (2014 dollars) Difference $53,198 $52,622 1.1% decrease "What you are doing is the right approach, looking at real income instead of nominal income," Chowdhury said. "The real reason they (Walker) use nominal income is because it looks better." Our rating Walker said that from 2010-2014, median household income in Wisconsin "has actually gone up 7.4 percent." In the best light, median household income in Wisconsin rose by 7.4 percent from 2010 to 2014. But the better figures account for inflation. And by that measure, income dropped by 1.1 percent during that period. For a statement that contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate Walker’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-09658	On legalizing illegal immigrants.	half flip	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/30/lou-dobbs/did-lou-dobbs-oppose-amnesty-he-doesnt-oppose-it-n/	Before resigning as a CNN anchor Nov. 11, Lou Dobbs made a name for himself opposing illegal immigration. So we were surprised to see him a few weeks later on the Spanish-language network Telemundo declaring himself a friend to Latinos. "Whatever you have thought of me in the past, I can tell you right now that I am one of your greatest friends and I mean for us to work together," Dobbs said during a half-hour interview with Maria Celeste on the news program Al Rojo Vivo . Dobbs said he was considering his options and might make a run for public office. For most of the interview, Celeste grilled Dobbs about news reports aired on his CNN show that she said were inflammatory and denigrated immigrants. Dobbs said he made mistakes and corrected them, which Celeste disputed. One of the top examples was a report Dobbs ran in 2007 that said undocumented immigrants were responsible for 7,000 new cases of leprosy spread over three years, a claim that has been widely debunked . (There were actually 431 new cases between 2003 and 2005.) Dobbs said on Telemundo that the United States needs a "rational, effective humane policy" for immigration that emphasized securing the border. But also said, "We need the ability to legalize illegal immigrants on certain conditions." That last point surprised us, because we thought Dobbs opposed efforts to offer citizenship to undocumented immigrants, commonly called amnesty. We went poring through the files, and interestingly, we found no point-blank case where Dobbs himself said he personally opposed amnesty. But he certainly gave the impression that he didn't much care for it. He was particularly opposed to a 2007 immigration bill promoted by President George W. Bush and Republican Sen. John McCain that included eventual citizenship for some illegal immigrants. In one show, he called the bill "idiotic," "just bizarre" and "a horrible piece of legislation." He asked his viewers to vote on the following question: "Do you believe the Senate, the White House and those who support amnesty for millions of illegal aliens are simply ignoring our existing U.S. law and the will of the American people? Yes or no? Cast your vote at loudobbs.com," he said on May 23, 2007. Later, he reported, "The results of our poll tonight: 97 percent of you responding that the Senate, the White House and those who support amnesty for millions of illegal aliens are ignoring not only existing U.S. law, but the will of the American people." Dobbs gave another provocative answer to reporter Leslie Stahl of 60 Minutes when she interviewed him in May 2007. "He all but campaigns against the president's guest worker proposal and seemed to suggest that all illegals should be rounded up," Stahl said, then asked him directly, "But I wonder if you think that we can possibly deport all of those people?" "I've never called for their deportation," Dobbs said. "But at the same time, when this president and open-borders, illegal-alien-amnesty advocates say, 'You can't deport them,' my answer is: 'You want to bet?' Because this is the United States. ... I think this country can do anything it sets its mind to." We next turned to two advocates on different sides of the immigration issue to see what they thought of Dobbs' recent comments to Telemundo. The Southern Poverty Law Center has criticized Dobbs for promoting anti-immigrant views and false news reports. The center's director of research, Heidi Beirich, said that Dobbs has claimed many times to be a friend to immigrants, even though he brings on anti-immigrant guests who make false statements. "He's let his guests say things that he hasn't challenged many, many times," Beirich said, "He'll sit there and make comments like, 'Incredible,' 'Amazing,' 'Mind-boggling.'" Of his comments on Telemundo, Beirich said, "It seemed to me very cynical and opportunistic, based on the idea that he wants to jump into politics." We also spoke with Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies and the author of The New Case Against Immigration, Both Legal and Illegal . Krikorian said he differs with Dobbs in that Dobbs generally favored legal immigration, opposing citizenship only for those who entered the country illegally. "He was clearly opposed to legalizing illegal aliens, period. There is just no question about it," Krikorian said. "Everyone who cared about immigration thought he was against amnesty." We asked Krikorian if there was any sort of middle ground here in which someone could favor citizenship for some undocumented immigrants but still be opposed to amnesty. Krikorian said he didn't think so. "That's what amnesty means -- letting illegal immigrants stay," he said. "He was against legalizing illegal immigrants, and now he says he's for it." We reached a spokesman for Dobbs, Robert Dilenschneider, who said that Dobbs does indeed believe that undocumented immigrants should be allowed to stay in the country under certain conditions. "I think you're going to see a new Lou Dobbs in the next year or two, a man looking for solutions, not for problems," he added. In ruling on whether Dobbs changed his position on citizenship for undocumented immigrants, it's clear that he now favors legalization under certain circumstances. We have not been able to find statements in the past where Dobbs said specifically that he opposed amnesty. But he gave the distinct impression that he opposed it, and many people clearly thought he did oppose it. Now, at a minimum, Dobbs is significantly changing his tone on the issue. We hesitate to give him a Full Flop because we found his older position to be slippery and unclear. So we rate his position a Half Flip.

pomt-08023	On choosing a Texas House speaker	full flop	/texas/statements/2011/jan/08/warren-chisum/texas-rep-warren-chisum-two-minds-role-gop-caucus-/	Pointing to the Republican romp in the November elections and a desire to see a "conservative" lead the Texas House, state Rep. Warren Chisum, R-Pampa, is pushing the GOP caucus to select a speaker candidate during its scheduled closed-door Jan. 10 meeting. "The voters of Texas have elected a strong overwhelming majority of Republicans to the Texas House of Representatives," Chisum says in a Dec. 21 press release. "We need to respond to the will of the voters and work together to select a single Republican nominee for Speaker." He then notes there are three GOP candidates for speaker and says the "Republican caucus is the appropriate place for us to narrow the field to one candidate." Chisum and Rep. Ken Paxton, R-McKinney, are challenging the current speaker, Rep. Joe Straus, R-San Antonio. Whoever wins the post presides over the House and appoints its committees and committee chairs. Any speaker candidate agreed upon within the 101-member GOP caucus would be all but guaranteed to win when the 150-member body elects the speaker Jan. 11. In committing their votes to that candidate, Republicans could unilaterally choose the speaker. We're not sure the speaker-apparent has ever been designated through a caucus vote. But in the last 20 years, the speaker has been chosen by the entire membership in open session on the House floor. That doesn't mean the outcome is a surprise: The votes generally accord with written pledges that speaker hopefuls have already secured from members. In a Jan. 3 letter to House members, former Democratic House Speaker Rayford Price urged lawmakers not to anoint a speaker through a GOP caucus vote. "A majority of a political caucus has no right or authority to direct how any member will cast his vote," Price's letter states. "I cannot believe any member would agree to give up that right and duty as is being suggested." According to a July 2002 Austin American-Statesman news story, a similar push for the GOP caucus to hold a vote on a speaker candidate came that year, ahead of the November election, when Republicans were expected to win the majority in the Texas House for the first time in 130 years. The article says that "Republican Party delegates voted at their convention in early June to require their House members to agree to vote as a caucus for speaker, and to bind all the Republicans to vote for whomever the caucus chooses." But at about the same time, according to the story, 23 "Republican House members signed an open letter to newspapers saying they thought the requirement flew in the face of the bipartisanship President George W. Bush lauded while he was governor." There never was such a caucus vote, according to Rep. Todd Smith, R-Euless, among the signers of the 2002 letter. Chisum also was one of those 23 objectors, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reminded readers in a Dec. 23, 2010, blog post. Chisum's signature on that letter was also brought to our attention by GOP consultant Bryan Eppstein, who has Straus as a client. So, has Chisum changed his position on the appropriate way to pick a speaker? The 2002 Chisum-supported letter — which appeared in the Star-Telegram June 6, 2002 under the headline "Let's not have partisan speaker elections" — says that letting the majority party select the speaker would remake Texas in the image of Washington. "In Washington, each party caucus nominates one candidate for speaker," the letter says. "House members then are forced to vote for their party's candidate. A bare majority of the members ... of one political party decides who wins." In contrast, the letter praises the Texas practice: "The outcome is not determined by the majority party. It is an open election in which any member may nominate any other member. The speaker is elected by a majority of all members of the House — Republican and Democrat." The letter urges House Republicans to resist calls for the caucus to select a single GOP candidate. "Now that it appears Republicans will gain a majority of Texas House seats this November, some — but not all — of our Republican colleagues are eager to change this system and seize control so that no Democrat will have a voice in choosing the next speaker," the letter says. "They want effectively to elect the speaker in the Republican caucus. To support such a monumental policy change simply and solely because it improves the odds of a particular speaker candidate is short sighted and fundamentally wrong." We wondered what led Chisum to advocate a similar policy change for the 2011 speaker election. He did not respond to our inquiries. However, in a Dec. 29 press release, Chisum made an assertion that indicated he may be playing tit for tat with the Democrats. He said Democratic "members of the Texas House caucused before the last legislative session to elect Speaker Straus. ... Therefore, when we convene on January 10th, I call on Representative (Larry) Taylor as the Republican Caucus chair, to call for a vote to determine the Republican preference for Speaker of the Texas House." Soon after, a post on the online news site Quorum Report challenged Chisum's claim that the Democrats had caucused to elect Straus. Chisum fired back in a second news release that day, pointing to a pledge that some Democratic members made shortly before the 2009 session not to vote for the incumbent speaker, Rep. Tom Craddick, R-Midland. Chisum said: "Now, it seems to me that when you see a letter with 64 signatures, released by the Democratic Caucus, all taking a unified party position on the speaker's race, that it just might be fair to say that the Democrats 'caucused' and took a position on the speaker's race. We all know that every one of those 64 Democrats subsequently pledged to vote and did vote for Joe Straus for speaker. ... My position is that the Republicans should also caucus and take a unified position on the race for speaker." We're not truth-testing whether the Democrats' actions then constituted a caucus vote. The test is whether Chisum's recent call-to-caucus reverses the position he took in 2002. We find that it does. Mark this a Full Flop.

pomt-12979	Fifty percent of workers ages 55 to 64 have "zero" money "in the bank as they enter retirement."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/dec/21/bernie-sanders/approaching-retirement-half-workers-55-64-have-zer/	At a post-election town hall meeting in Kenosha, Wis., 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders opined on why Republican Donald Trump is headed for the Oval Office and not the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. "One of the arguments as to why Trump won is the belief that most of – or many of -- his supporters are sexist or are racist or are homophobes. I happen not to believe that`s the case," Sanders said at the Dec. 12, 2016 meeting, which was broadcast on MSNBC. "I think what he did do is, he said, ‘You know what, there is a lot of pain in this country; people are scared and people are worried.’ One example: Right now, 50 percent of older workers, 55 to 64 -- you know how much money they have in the bank, as they enter retirement? Who wants to guess? "Zero!" the Vermont senator exclaimed. "What do you think? People are scared to death of retirement." On another haves and have-nots claim -- that "the top one-tenth of 1 percent" of Americans "own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent" -- we gave Sanders a Mostly True. But, are half of Americans approaching retirement with nothing in the bank? Sanders’ evidence To support Sanders’ statement, his campaign cited a May 2015 report on the financial status of retirees and workers approaching retirement from a gold-standard source, the nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office. Sanders had requested it in his role as ranking member of the Senate Subcommittee on Primary Health and Retirement Security. The report used data from the latest triennial Survey of Consumer Finances done by the Federal Reserve Board, in 2013. It is the premier survey of wealth in the United States, according to Wellesley College economics professor Courtney Coile, who is the associate director of the Retirement Research Center at the National Bureau of Economic Research. The GAO found that 52 percent of households age 55 and over have no money in what the report defined as retirement savings -- an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) or a defined-contribution plan, such as a 401(k). But that group includes people who are well into retirement. The situation is somewhat less dire for the group that Sanders cited at the town hall, those ages 55 to 64. The report found that 41 percent of the people in that group have no money in defined-contribution plans or IRAs. There’s another point of clarification, however. The report did not consider in that statistic other savings that the 55 to 64 age group have. The Center for Retirement Research at Boston College ran those numbers for us, using the same Federal Reserve survey data, although it expressed the statistic a little differently. The center found that 38.5 percent of Americans ages 55 to 64 do not have a retirement account such as an IRA, traditional pension or 401(k), but nevertheless have some savings. With that group, the median amount of their savings is $1,000 -- in other words, half of them have savings of more than $1,000 and half have less. So, it’s not as though those people have "zero" in the bank, although many don’t have savings that would last them very long in retirement. Our rating Sanders said 50 percent of workers ages 55 to 64 have "zero" money "in the bank as they enter retirement." His claim is somewhat high, but doesn’t give a misleading impression. A widely respected government report says 41 percent of Americans 55 to 64 have no savings in common retirement accounts such as an IRA or a 401(k). It’s also worth noting that some in that group have other savings not in retirement accounts, though for many of them it’s less than $1,000. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7af4780e-159e-412b-8509-f19e0c95b6da	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2016-12-21T05:00:00	2016-12-12	['None']
pomt-07318	Says businesses "already pay most of the taxes."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/may/15/steve-ogden/state-sen-steve-ogden-says-businesses-pay-most-tax/	Asked by reporters how legislators can address the state’s recurring revenue shortfall, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Steve Ogden reiterated his belief that a good start would be reworking the business franchise tax. Readers may recall that the franchise tax was revamped in 2006 to help pay for a statewide reduction in local school property taxes, but it has not brought in as much money as was projected. However, "the issue is not to single out businesses as some sort of villain," Ogden, R-Bryan, said April 5. "They already pay most of the taxes. The issue is having a tax system that, in my opinion, is uniform and equitable and as low as possible." Readers who spotted Ogden’s comment in an Austin American-Statesman news story asked us to check whether businesses do "pay most of the taxes." Responding to our inquiry, Ogden pointed to the way the tax system is structured in Texas. Because the state has no personal income tax, Ogden said, most state and local tax revenue comes from taxes that are levied on businesses and individuals alike. And because businesses "are the largest economic entities in the state," he said, it stands to reason that they pay the most. Ogden referred us to a biennial report from the state comptroller’s office on tax burdens in Texas. The latest version, published in February, projects how much businesses and individual consumers will pay in state sales and use taxes, franchise taxes, gasoline taxes, motor vehicle sales taxes, cigarette taxes, oil production taxes and school property taxes in 2013. According to the report, two of the taxes — franchise and oil production — are initially paid entirely by businesses. A third tax, the cigarette tax, is paid entirely by consumers. The remaining four taxes are shared between consumers and businesses. The largest expected revenue producers are school property taxes ($11.3 billion projected to be paid by businesses in 2013, $10.7 billion by consumers) and state sales taxes ($9.8 billion projected to be paid by businesses, $12.1 billion by consumers). To get a total tax dollar amount for each category — consumers and businesses — we added up the estimated burden imposed by each of the taxes analyzed in the report. The results were close: $28.2 billion for businesses and $27.5 billion for consumers. Two previous comptroller’s tax-incidence reports calculated slightly greater tax burdens for businesses, compared with individuals, but differed from the current report because they included a natural gas tax but not cigarette and oil production taxes. The 2009 report, projecting ahead to 2011, estimated $30.1 billion for businesses and $28.4 billion for consumers. The 2007 report, projecting for 2009, estimated $25.9 billion for businesses vs. $25.2 billion for consumers. Next, we touched base with the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, a business group, about Ogden’s statement. Dale Craymer, its president, said by email that the comptroller’s report does not consider "the entire spectrum of taxes in the state." R.J. DeSilva, a spokesman for the comptroller’s office, told us that the six state taxes in the agency’s 2011 report — excluding school property taxes, which are collected locally — represented 86 percent of state tax revenue in fiscal 2010. Also excluded are property taxes paid to local governments such as cities and counties. Craymer suggested that we consider what he called the most comprehensive look at business taxes, a study done for the Council on State Taxation, a Washington-based trade association representing corporate businesses. Bill Hammond, president of the Texas Association of Business, also pointed us to the report. The study, by the economics and statistics unit of consulting firm Ernst & Young, estimates the taxes paid by businesses to state and local governments in each state in fiscal year 2008. Among them: property taxes, state and local sales taxes paid by businesses on purchases of production materials and equipment, corporate income and franchise taxes, unemployment insurance taxes, and business and corporate license taxes. The study estimates that in Texas, businesses paid 61.2 percent of state and local taxes. That compares with a national share of 44.1 percent. We asked how the study was done. Andrew Phillips, an author, told us that researchers drew data from several sources, including the U.S. Census Bureau, IRS and Bureau of Economic Analysis. For another perspective on the Ernst & Young report, we turned to Matt Gardner, executive director of the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a research arm of Washington-based Citizens for Tax Justice, which says it advocates for fair taxation of middle- and low-income families. Gardner suggested that the Ernst & Young report may have overestimated the share of total property taxes paid by businesses. He said his own estimate, based on available 2008 data from the Census Bureau, indicates that Texas homeowners paid about 45 percent of property taxes that year. If one assumes that businesses paid the rest, Gardner said, their share is 55 percent, not the 62 percent share of property taxes reported by Ernst & Young. Still, Gardner didn’t quibble much with Ogden’s statement. "It’s probably OK to assert that a majority of Texas taxes fall initially on non-individuals," he said. Both Gardner and Hammond, the TAB president, echoed Ogden’s point that businesses in Texas shoulder a higher-than-average initial tax burden because the state is one of a minority that have no income tax on individuals. But inherent in the distinction between taxes on individuals and on businesses is the idea that the latter can shift their burdens to customers, employees, tenants and others. The comptroller’s report says: "It should be recognized that any tax levied directly on a business" will ultimately be passed on — either to consumers through higher prices, to employees through lower wages or to business owners and shareholders through reduced profits. Businesses can also push some of their tax burden out of the state. How much tax shifting occurs depends on the market in which a business operates and other complicated factors. "The only thing that can be said with certainty is that no one really knows how taxes (particularly those levied on property and business) are shifted," according to the comptroller’s report. Tom Neubig, an author of the Ernst & Young report, told us, "All economists would say that it isn’t business that bears the burden of the taxes; it’s people." He pointed to a January 2010 national study in which he and other researchers, using 2005 tax data, estimated where state and local business taxes ultimately fall. The study concluded that in Texas, business owners wound up holding the bag for 4 percent of those taxes. The rest were shifted into higher consumer prices (2 percent), lower wages (45 percent) and to people living outside Texas (49 percent). For Gardner, this "final incidence" is more important than whether businesses or individuals initially pay the taxes. Upshot: The analyses we found basically support Ogden’s claim that businesses pay "most" of the taxes in Texas, though the margin varies from a slim 51 percent (according to the state comptroller) to 61 percent (Ernst & Young). However, analysts also agree that businesses — unlike individuals — can offload their tax burden through various means. We rate Ogden’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-11849	The diversity visa lottery is "plagued by fraud."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/06/david-perdue/gop-sen-david-perdue-says-diversity-visa-lottery-p/	Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., repeated President Donald Trump’s criticism of the diversity visa program, claiming that the program is "plagued by fraud." An Oct. 31 terrorist attack in New York City resulted in eight deaths and about a dozen injuries. Trump said the suspect came to the United States through the diversity visa program and called for its termination. ".@realDonaldTrump is right, the Diversity Visa Lottery is a problem and is plagued by fraud. The RAISE Act would eliminate it. #gapol," Perdue tweeted Nov. 1. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Perdue co-sponsored the Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy (RAISE) Act, seeking to reduce legal immigration to the United States and to eliminate the diversity visa program, which allows up to 50,000 immigrants per year. We wanted to know the accuracy of Perdue’s fraud claim and found that government reports and officials have identified fraud as an issue in the program. The State Department said it did not have data to determine how widespread the problem is, and experts told us they were unaware of quantitative estimates. Diversity visa program, fraud and scams The diversity visa program, administered by the State Department, was created in 1990 through a bill signed into law by former President George H. W. Bush. The program is intended to diversify the U.S. immigrant population, granting up to 50,000 visas annually to individuals from countries that in the previous five years had low rates of immigration to the United States. A lottery system that began in 1995 allows individuals to enter for a chance to apply for a visa. Fraud in the diversity visa program has been a concern for years among lawmakers and government officials. Reports of fraud have even led government agencies to post warnings about scammers’ attempt to deceive applicants. But the State Department told us it did not have data on how widespread fraud is in the program, or what percentage of applications or lottery entries per year are believed to be fraudulent. There are "extensive programs to vigorously prevent and combat U.S. passport and visa fraud" and the department investigates all fraud allegations, said Noel Clay, State Department spokesman. A 2007 U.S. Government and Accountability report said the program was "vulnerable to fraud committed by and against (diversity visa) applicants" and that the State Department had not compiled comprehensive data on detected and suspected fraudulent activity. Consular officers reported that in countries such as Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Ghana, Nepal, Nigeria, and Ukraine, applicants lacked access to computers or were not internet savvy, therefore sought help from "visa agents" or "visa consultants." Some providers took advantage of applicants by disseminating misleading information, intercepting official correspondence, and charging exorbitant fees for each step in the process, the 2007 report said. In Bangladesh, some agents used their own address on entry forms so that program notification letters would go to them instead of the person in the entry, and in some cases "held these letters for up to $20,000 in ransom" or offered to reduce the fee if the selectee entered into a sham marriage and added the spouse to the application, the report said. A September 2013 report from the State Department’s Office of Inspector General said there was a "pervasive and sophisticated fraud scheme" affecting the program in Ukraine. Organized fraud rings in Ukraine masquerading as travel agencies buy, steal or obtain from public sources information on Ukrainian citizens and enter their data into the program’s online entry form. The fraud rings contact individuals who win the lottery and demand $15,000 in exchange for a confirmation number sent by the State Department that’s needed to proceed with the visa application. If the person can’t pay, fraud rings seek to enter that person in a sham marriage with someone else who wants to come to the United States and is willing to pay the fraud rings a fee for the pairing, the report said. "There is no question that fraud is rampant in the diversity visa lottery program," said Jessica M. Vaughan, director of policy studies at Center for Immigration Studies, which favors low-immigration levels. Vaughan said there’s "massive document fraud" that’s difficult for consular officers to detect — where people apply first and later produce required information, such as education or work experience documentation. Vaughan and Jan C. Ting, a law professor at the Temple University Beasley School of Law in Philadelphia, told us they were unaware of quantitative estimates of the amount of fraud in the program. "It is very likely that people have obtained diversity visas through fraud and successfully immigrated to the U.S. and become citizens because of their fraud," said Ting, who in 2004 testified before a House committee in objection to the program. Charles D. Piot, an anthropologist and professor at Duke University, says there was a lot of gaming of the system when it was first instituted, but technology added to the process now makes it unlikely for a type of fraud where an applicant is substituted by another person. "It's important to emphasize that today it's impossible for applicants to sell his or her identity, to swap out that identity, because of the biometrics," said Piot, who has done research on Togolese who came to the United States via the visa lottery. Our ruling Perdue said the diversity visa program is "plagued by fraud." The State Department did not provide data on how widespread fraud is within the program, but fraud issues have been documented for many years. Some of the fraud involves organized groups entering individuals into the lottery without their consent and then extracting money from them in exchange for a confirmation number needed for the visa application process. Technology helps prevent the type of fraud where a person would take the place of the original applicant. We rate Perdue’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-08830	On whether to eliminate the state income tax.	half flip	/ohio/statements/2010/aug/12/john-kasich/kasich-silence-casts-doubt-whether-he-would-seek-i/	John Kasich stormed the stage in a park in his hometown of Westerville, Ohio, last year to emphatically declare his candidacy to become the Republican nominee for governor. He offered big-picture ideas, the staples of conservative politics — shrinking government spending and lowering taxes. One specific tax goal he reaffirmed that June 1 was to eliminate Ohio’s state income tax. It’s a goal Kasich had mentioned in earlier speeches in the run-up to that formal announcement. And he left no doubt where he stood that day. "We’ll march over time to destroy that income tax that has sucked the vitality out of this state," Kasich roared. But as time has marched on, a funny thing happened. Kasich has stopped calling for an elimination of Ohio’s income tax. It is absent from his campaign website, where he argues spending cuts are needed so taxes can be lowered. And at a speaking event Aug. 4, Kasich talked nearly an hour without mentioning the income tax repeal once. We decided to run his remarks through the Flip-O-Meter to see if he’s done a full gainer on the issue. When he launched his campaign, Kasich’s call to eliminate the state income tax was emphatic. But he has never detailed how he would eliminate a major tax that provides much of the state’s operating money. He repeatedly has dodged reporter’s questions for details about his plan. Full of disdain, he often would brush aside questions, sometimes snapping that he would discuss specifics when he was good and ready. Each week Kasich delivers campaign speeches across Ohio and it’s common now for him to not mention his cornerstone policy issue. Perhaps growing weary of the questions, Kasich lately has softened his retorts and taken pains to be less bombastic and more assuring that he has not abandoned his idea. "Nothing’s changed on that. I’m for reducing taxes," Kasich said to reporters Aug. 4 after his speech in Columbus. "Nothing has changed. But this idea of reducing these taxes, as I told you from the beginning, takes time. "There’s no obfuscation there at all. . . Nothing’s changed about any of my programs or my plans." Kasich was essentially forced to distance himself from his own idea when Republican state Rep. John Adams, of Sidney, near Dayton, last winter introduced a bill that would phase out the state’s income tax. Democrats, who control the House, happily linked Adams’ bill to Kasich’s idea and gave the bill a series of hotly promoted committee hearings. In January, the Legislative Service Commission, an independent state agency, released an analysis of Adams’ bill and predicted the plan would cost Ohio more than $800 million next year and as much as $12 billion by 2020. In all, eliminating the state’s income tax could blow a 40 percent hole in the general revenue fund, which could in turn impact police, fire and local government appropriations. Those details make Kasich’s plan all the more intriguing. He insists it can be done, even as he refuses to offer up details or talk about it on the campaign trail. Sure Kasich says he’s standing by his plan to eliminate the state’s income tax but his silence on the campaign trail about an issue he once was so boastful about speaks volumes. His unwillingness to answer questions or provide details about how he would eliminate the tax makes it appear as if he wishes he never promised its demise so prominently. He hasn’t publicly gone that far, yet, so we rate his position a Half Flip.	None	John Kasich	None	None	None	2010-08-12T11:45:00	2010-08-12	['None']
pomt-09332	"The video doesn't show the broader picture of the firing that was going on at American troops."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/12/robert-gates/gates-said-leaked-military-video-shooting-iraq-doe/	On ABC's This Week on April 11, 2010, host Jake Tapper asked Defense Secretary Robert Gates about the recently released WikiLeaks video showing American soldiers in an Apache helicopter opening fire on a group of men on a Baghdad street, which seriously injured two children and resulted in the deaths of two Reuters journalists who were mistaken for insurgents. "I understand the fog of war," Tapper said. "And I understand that this was a very difficult situation. Does the release of that video, and the fact that that happened damage the image of the U.S. in the world?" "I don't think so," Gates said. "They're in a combat situation. The video doesn't show the broader picture of the firing that was going on at American troops. It's obviously a hard thing to see. It's painful to see, especially when you learn after the fact what was going on. But you -- you talked about the fog of war. These people were operating in split second situations." "And, you know, we've investigated it very thoroughly. And it's unfortunate. It's clearly not helpful. But by the same token, I think it should not have any lasting consequences." We are fact-checking the claim that, "The video doesn't show the broader picture of the firing that was going on at American troops." According to a military review completed five days after the incident, soldiers in that company "had been under sporadic small arms and rocket propelled grenade fire since" the operation -- described as "clearing their sector and looking for weapons caches" -- began at dawn that morning. That comports with the detailed reporting from David Finkel, a Washington Post journalist who was embedded for eight months with the battalion in question, and who described the events that day in his book, The Good Soldiers. "All morning long, this part of Al-Amin had been the most hostile," Finkel wrote. "East Al-Amin had been filled with gunfire and some explosions. There had been reports of sniper fire, rooftop chases, and rocket-propelled grenades being fired at Bravo Company, and as the fighting continued, it attracted the attention of Namir Noor-Eldeen, a twenty-two year-old photographer for the Reuters news agency who lived in Baghdad, and Saeed Chmagh, 40, his driver." In the graphic and controversial video footage shot from an Apache helicopter on the morning of July 12, 2007, and later leaked by whistle-blowers to WikiLeaks -- now viewed by millions --it is clear from the audio that a soldier on the helicopter mistakes a camera with a telephoto lens slung across the shoulder of one of the journalists for a rocket-propelled grenade launcher (RPG). An investigative report by the military issued five days later concluded that among the group of 11 men on the street, two were carrying cameras with large telephoto lenses ("which could be easily mistaken for" a machine gun) but also that at least one other in the group had a rocket-propelled grenade launcher, and another had a rifle. The video at one point shows the Reuters cameraman peering from behind a wall, pointing a long telephoto lens. According to the military investigation, there were U.S. ground troops less than 100 meters away, and "due to the furtive nature of his movements, the cameraman gave every appearance of preparing to fire an RPG on U.S. soldiers." The report states that ground troops later discovered two RPGs, an RPG launcher and a rifle where the group had been clustered, and an RPG round under one of the bodies. "There is no question that coalition forces were clearly engaged in combat operations against a hostile force," Lt. Col. Scott Bleichwehl, a spokesman for the multinational forces in Baghdad, told the New York Times a day after the incident. Glenn Greenwald, an author and blogger for the online magazine Salon who has been highly critical of the military response, said Gates' comment was "sufficiently vague that it can't be called factually false, but is quite misleading." None of the people who were shot at by the Apache in that video ever fired on American troops, he said. "It's true that on that day -- and every day -- there were firefights involving American forces, but that had nothing to do with the incident depicted in the video," Greenwald said. "Worse, the part of the video that caused the most controversy -- the shooting of unarmed rescuers who were dragging an unarmed, wounded man to safety -- has absolutely nothing to do with prior firefights. Nothing that happened previously could justify or even mitigate the killing of people who plainly are not a threat and can pose no threat." The military investigation concluded that the men shot while trying to help one of the wounded journalists into a van were believed at the time to be insurgents. Two children in the van were seriously wounded. "I think it's fair to say that there have been many, many bad days for Iraqis and Americans, and this was one of them," Finkel wrote in an online Q & A about the video on April 6, 2010. By way of context, Finkel noted, "What's helpful to understand is that, contrary to some interpretations that this was an attack on some people walking down the street on a nice day, the day was anything but that. It happened in the midst of a large operation to clear an area where U.S. soldiers had been getting shot at, injured, and killed with increasing frequency. What the Reuters guys walked into was the very worst part, where the morning had been a series of RPG attacks and running gun battles. "More context," Finkel later added. "You're seeing an edited version of the video. The full video runs much longer. And it doesn't have the benefit of hindsight, in this case zooming in on the van and seeing those two children. The helicopters were perhaps a mile away. And as all of this unfolded, it was unclear to the soldiers involved whether the van was a van of good Samaritans or of insurgents showing up to rescue a wounded comrade. I bring these things up not to excuse the soldiers but to emphasize some of the real-time blurriness of those moments. "If you were to see the full video, you would see a person carrying an RPG launcher as he walked down the street as part of the group. Another was armed as well, as I recall. Also, if you had the unfortunate luck to be on site afterwards, you would have seen that one of the dead in the group was lying on top of a launcher. Because of that and some other things, EOD -- the Hurt Locker guys, I guess -- had to come in and secure the site. And again, I'm not trying to excuse what happened. But there was more to it for you to consider than what was in the released video." Asked about Finkel's comments, Greenwald said the only evidence for all of this is the video and the Army's investigative reports. "It's unclear from the video if someone had an RPG -- definitely possible, but far from definitive," Greenwald said. "The Army report claimed that an RGP was found at the scene -- impossible to verify or otherwise know, but that is what it claimed." Our aim here is not to settle this very complicated, controversial and terribly sad incident. We are not ruling on whether the United States military acted properly. Rather, we are looking specifically at Gates' comment that, "The video doesn't show the broader picture of the firing that was going on at American troops." Some might interpret Gates' comment to mean that if only the video had panned back, or started a little earlier, you'd see that this group of men in the street was firing at the Apache helicopter, and there's no evidence that that's the case. But we think Gates' words suggest he was speaking more broadly of the context around that incident, that -- as Finkel noted in providing context during his Q & A -- insurgents had been firing at American soldiers in that immediate area that very morning. And military reports support that. So we rule Gates' comment Mostly True.	None	Robert Gates	None	None	None	2010-04-12T18:07:14	2010-04-11	['United_States']
pomt-13822	"You're more likely to be the victim of a violent crime in Milwaukee than in 96 percent of the country."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jul/15/van-wanggaard/more-dangerous-milwaukee-96-nation/	Resentment and recrimination often characterize political relations between Milwaukee and the rest of Wisconsin. In the latest clash, the Milwaukee Public Schools board thwarted an effort by Republican state lawmakers to reform the low-performing district. That led the GOP leader of the Senate to say the Legislature might respond by cutting the district’s funding. About two weeks later, on July 10, 2016, another GOP lawmaker issued a broadside against largely Democratic Milwaukee. State Sen. Van Wanggaard of Racine wrote an opinion piece in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that was laden with statistical claims unfavorable to the city -- including one making a national comparison about crime that we want to check. "Recent complaints from Milwaukee leaders about their lack of state funding are misguided and lack perspective," the column began. "Unfortunately," Wanggaard later wrote, "the only way to cut this expenditure is to reduce the number of people needing assistance — reducing poverty. But the failing school system and Milwaukee's crime problem prevent that." Then came the claim we’re interested in, with Wanggaard saying "you're more likely to be the victim of a violent crime in Milwaukee than in 96 percent of the country." Milwaukee is known for a relatively high violent crime rate. But this way of expressing that has some problems. Trends in violent crime Across the country, crime has been on a downward trend. That’s what PolitiFact National reported in June 2016 in rating as Pants on Fire Donald Trump’s claim that "crime is rising." With regard to violent crime, our colleagues checked FBI figures through 2014, the latest year for which complete figures are available. They found that nationally, the rates of violent crime per 100,000 people have been falling on an almost uninterrupted basis since the early 1990s. As counted by the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR), violent crime includes murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. Milwaukee’s violent crime rate has been among the highest among large cities. In 2014, there were 8,864 violent crimes reported in the city, according to the FBI figures. That was up 8 percent from 8,194 in 2013. Now, to Wanggaard’s claim. Wanggaard’s evidence To back the statement, Wanggaard’s staff cited rankings from two websites that rank places to live. Each used the FBI’s UCR violent crime figures for 2014. AreaVibes.com says Milwaukee is safer than 4 percent of the cities in the United States. Another way to say that would be that Milwaukee’s violent crime rate is higher than 96 percent of the country. NeighborhoodScout.com says the figure is 3 percent. Michael O’Hear, a law professor at Marquette University in Milwaukee, told us the rankings give some basis for Wanggaard’s 96 percent claim. But O’Hear and other criminal justice experts told us there are problems with the claim. "It’s sort of a dubious measure on so many grounds," said Alfred Blumstein, an emeritus professor of urban systems and operations research Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Comparison problems 1. UCR figures are solid. But the FBI "strongly discourages" using them to make rankings to evaluate different communities, saying: "These incomplete analyses have often created misleading perceptions which adversely affect geographic entities and their residents. For this reason, the FBI has a long-standing policy against ranking participating law enforcement agencies on the basis of crime data alone … many factors cause the nature and type of crime to vary from place to place." 2. Across the country, violent crime generally is concentrated in larger cities, so it stands to reason there is less violent crime in most parts of the country. But the figures used in the website rankings compare Milwaukee with cities such as Mount Pleasant near Racine (15 violent crimes in 2014) and Sun Prairie (32) near Madison that have a population as low as 25,000. "There’s a world of difference between a city of 25,000 and a city the size of Milwaukee (population 600,000)," O’Hear said. 3. Violent crime in Milwaukee is concentrated in certain neighborhoods, while other neighborhoods carry no more risk of violent crime than many suburban neighborhoods. In other words, you’re not suddenly at great risk of being a violent crime victim simply by crossing the city limits. "Usually if you’re not hanging out" in high-crime neighborhoods, "your chances of being a victim of crime are pretty low," said Michael Jacobson, executive director of the City University of New York Institute for State & Local Governance. Our rating Wanggaard said: "You're more likely to be the victim of a violent crime in Milwaukee than in 96 percent of the country." Three rankings using violent crime rates from the FBI give Milwaukee such a ranking. But the FBI warns against using its figures to do rankings; the rankings compare Milwaukee to relatively tiny cities; and the claim makes a broad claim about Milwaukee but ignores the fact that most violent crime in the city is limited to certain neighborhoods. For a statement that is partially accurate but takes things out of context, our rating is Half True.	None	Van Wanggaard	None	None	None	2016-07-15T10:30:00	2016-07-10	['Milwaukee']
pomt-04526	The Obama administration’s "green" stimulus program "funneled close to $2 billion dollars to overseas firms," creating thousands of jobs in China.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/01/americans-tax-reform/anti-tax-group-says-obamas-stimulus-led-jobs-china/	Back in the spring, jobs and jobs alone seemed the core issue in the presidential race. Since then, the menu of issues has become longer, but a recent flyer from Americans for Tax Reform, a leading anti-tax group, seeks to put jobs front and center once again. The flyer appeared in mailboxes in New Hampshire and asks, where did the stimulus money go? A photo of President Barack Obama superimposed above a sprawling map of China in fire engine red provides an answer. Below the fold, an iconic photo of Mao Zedong is set against a newspaper headline "NH has lost more jobs to China than any other state." Inside, the text reads "The stimulus was intended to create ‘green’ American jobs. But the Obama administration funneled close to $2 billion to overseas firms. A Democratic Senator said this would create thousands of jobs in China." There is a lot to unpack here but the gist of it comes down to the assertion that about $2 billion in "green" stimulus money went to foreign companies, with particular benefits for China at the expense of American workers. That’s a claim that we can check. Foreign wind and solar suppliers Americans for Tax Reform cites the work of the Investigative Reporting Workshop, a project of American University headed by investigative journalists. In February, 2010, the workshop wrote that it had found that the largest stimulus program to develop alternative energy had handed out $2.1 billion for wind, solar and geothermal power and of that, 79 percent went to companies based overseas. We dug further and found some reports that Americans for Tax Reform missed but that bolster its claim. A later study from the workshop estimated the amount that had gone to overseas firms had reached nearly $2.4 billion. Later still, about a year after the first report, the lead author again updated his findings. The journalist, Russ Choma, noted that "most of the jobs that were created, in the United States at least, were short-term construction jobs." "Since the bulk of the companies that received the money were foreign," Choma continued, "and the bulk of the equipment (like wind turbines) were purchased from foreign companies, who mostly do their production overseas, very few of the high-skill, high-pay manufacturing jobs that green energy development can bring ended up in the United States." A study by the U.S. Department of Energy estimates that the domestic portion on wind projects ranges from 48 percent to 66 percent of the total investment. For large solar projects, the domestic portion falls in the 42 percent to 71 percent range. A complicated jobs picture Those wide ranges tell us that connecting taxpayer dollars to American jobs is not simple. Some foreign companies have American subsidiaries. Some American firms import large components. The people who have tried get a handle on this have looked at the two main programs the government used to build the renewable energy sector. The biggest program, called Section 1603, subsidized energy producers. It paid the project developers 30 percent of the total project cost after an installation was complete. So far, Section 1603 has cost about $14 billion. The smaller program, Section 48C, also provided a 30 percent subsidy but was focused on manufacturing. It helped companies that built or expanded manufacturing capacity in the U.S.. The final cost for 48C was $2.3 billion. Teasing out the ways that Section 1603 money worked its way through the economy is tricky. The reporter cited by Americans for Tax Reform spoke about his own uncertainty after months of research into wind power. "I can't say how many of the turbines built by American manufacturers were overseas," Choma said, "and how many of the turbines built by foreign manufacturers were built here." The case of the Danish firm Vestas shows the challenge when dealing with foreign-based firms. Vestas supplied over 1,800 turbines in the U.S. between 2009 and 2011, or about 15 percent of the total added in those years. On the power production side, the Section 1603 subsidies for the turbines alone would be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. But Vestas also received nearly $52 million through the government’s program to boost manufacturing. Those dollars ended up in Colorado for the construction of American subsidiary plants, Vestas Nacelles, Vestas Blades, and Vestas Towers. A declining wind industry has led to layoffs but at last count, the Danish firm employed about 1,700 workers in those plants, with about 5,000 workers statewide tied to the wind industry. "This is insourcing," said Peter Kelley, spokesman for the American Wind Energy Association, an industry trade group. "It’s important to draw foreign investment that creates jobs here in the U.S." Tracking the jobs for a domestic company is no easier. GE is the nation’s largest supplier of wind turbines. The Connecticut-based firm is providing the turbines for a wind farm in Alaska. GE might be an American company but the project includes blades made in Brazil and towers from China. On paper, it might look like stimulus money would stay in the country but in fact, not all of it would. The most detailed estimate of the total number of American jobs created through the 1603 program comes from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. In a 2012 report, it found that from 2009 to 2011, spending on wind and solar produced some 57,000 to 80,000 jobs each year in construction, manufacturing and ongoing operations. These are the jobs that remain after you subtract the dollars that went overseas. Importantly, the total earnings of American workers tied to these projects fell in the range of $9.5 billion to $14.3 billion. If these numbers are right, they tell us the low end of that estimate is more than the cost of the 1603 program, about $8.7 billion, during those years. This might be expected since 70 percent of the project costs were covered by private money. The China factor The flyer from Americans for Tax Reform casts China as a major beneficiary of stimulus spending. While Chinese firms have certainly received some contracts, they do not seem to have played a major role. Their biggest place in the American renewable energy marketplace is in solar. China has about half of the American photovoltaic market, according to Recharge News, an online industry magazine. In 2011, that was worth about $2.8 billion to Chinese manufacturers. Subsidies for the solar industry through the 1603 program amount to about 20 percent of all spending. Wind accounts for about 70 percent of the dollars. In wind, China is a negligible player. Of over 12,000 turbines installed under the 1603 program by 2011, Chinese firms had a role in six -- five in Texas and one in Iowa. This according to the American Wind Energy Association, an industry trade group. For the curious, here is the national breakdown for the number of turbines installed in the U.S.from 2009 to 2011, according to the American Wind Energy Association and the Congressional Research Service: United States - GE, Clipper - 49 percent Germany - Siemens, RePower, Nordex -15 percent Denmark - Vestas - 15 percent Spain - Gamesa - 7 percent India - Suzlon - 6 percent Japan - Mitsubishi - 6 percent All others - 2 percent Our ruling The Americans for Tax Reform flyer said the Obama administration funneled about $2 billion in "green" stimulus money to foreign companies, with particular benefits for China. On the dollars, the claim understates the amount that went to foreign owned companies. It was certainly more than $2 billion, which would bolster the group’s claim. But the flyer offers a very selective picture of what the stimulus did for American workers.. The distinction between domestic and foreign companies and the impact of that on jobs is unclear. And while the stimulus did help pay for high-skilled jobs overseas, it also leveraged thousands of jobs in the U.S. and produced earnings greater than the amount of money spent by the government. Money did leave the country, but not with the impact the flyer presents. Regarding China, the flyer exaggerates the benefits for that nation. China stood to gain from spending on solar power, and it is hard to see how it wouldn’t have collected millions of taxpayer dollars. But solar represented about a fifth of the stimulus subsidies. The wind projects accounted for 70 percent and in wind, China played a tiny role. The countries that gained the most overall were European. The statement has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-04672	"I've cut taxes for ... middle-class families, small businesses."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/07/barack-obama/barack-obama-said-hes-cut-taxes-middle-class-famil/	In his speech at the Democratic National Committee in Charlotte, N.C., President Barack Obama mocked Republicans for turning to tax cuts as the solution to every problem. "Have a surplus? Try a tax cut. Deficit too high? Try another. Feel a cold coming on? Take two tax cuts, roll back some regulations, and call us in the morning!" Obama said. "Now, I’ve cut taxes for those who need it – middle-class families and small businesses. But I don’t believe that another round of tax breaks for millionaires will bring good jobs to our shores, or pay down our deficit," Obama said. Obama is often accused by Republicans of raising taxes, and he has raised some taxes during his presidency. He’s also said that he intends to raise income tax rates for couples who make more than $250,000 a year or single people who make more than $200,000 a year. Here, we’re going to look at his claim to cut taxes for "middle-class families and small businesses." (We’ve been tracking all of Obama’s campaign promises about taxes on our Obameter.) Obama has signed off on two major tax cuts for middle-class families: the Making Work Pay tax credit that was part of the economic stimulus of 2009 and a temporary reduction in Social Security payroll taxes that went into effect in 2011. As part of the stimulus, formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, single workers collected a $400 tax credit, and working couples got $800. The credit didn’t come in the form of a check; it worked out so that most workers had about $400 less in federal income taxes withheld from their paychecks spread out over the entire year. Most workers received a tax cut under that plan, with the exception of some high earners. The tax cuts phased out for couples who make more than $250,000 or a single person making over $200,000, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center . The result mirrored what Obama promised he would do on the campaign. Obama pledged tax cuts of $500 for each worker and $1,000 for working couples. We rated the promise a Compromise on our Obameter because the resulting tax cut was a little lower than what Obama wanted. That tax cut expired at the end of 2011. But Obama won another round of tax cuts for most workers in a December 2010 tax deal with Republicans in Congress. Those tax cuts -- a temporary reduction in worker’s payroll taxes, worth about 2 percent of total earnings -- expire in 2013. Again, the tax cut didn’t come as a check, but gives workers a little more in their paychecks than they would have otherwise. Obama also has passed an array of tax cuts for small businesses. Eight of them were included in the stimulus, the Affordable Care Act (also known as the health care law), and the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act (also known as the HIRE Act). Among the cuts were the exclusion of up to 75 percent of capital gains on key small business investments; a tax credit for the cost of health insurance for small business employees and new tax credits for hiring Americans out of work for at least two months. Another eight cuts came via the Small Business Jobs Act, signed by Obama in September of 2010. These included: adding deductions for business cell phone use; creating a new deduction for health care costs for the self-employed; allowing greater deductions for business start-up expenses; eliminating taxes on all capital gains from key small business investments, and raising the small business expense limit to $500,000. Three months later, the president signed a tax bill that raised the expense limit to 100 percent of small business new investments until the end of 2011. It also extended the elimination of capital gains taxes for small business investments through the end of 2012. (For more details, see our previous fact-check that provided at least 16 tax cuts to small businesses; we rated it Mostly True.) To be clear, this doesn’t mean the middle-class and small businesses haven’t seen any tax increases under the Obama administration. We rated his campaign promise that no family making less than $250,000 will see "any form of tax increase" as Promise Broken. Obama has signed off on new taxes on cigarettes and indoor tanning. His health care law includes a tax penalty for people who don’t buy health insurance; that starts in 2014. (It includes hardship exemptions for people who can’t find affordable policies.) Also, under the health care law, small businesses that have more than 50 employees that don’t offer their employees health insurance could face fines. Our ruling Obama has raised some taxes during his presidency, but he’s also pursued broad-based tax cuts for the middle class and small businesses. We particularly give weight here to the tax cuts that were part of the stimulus and the payroll tax holiday, which reduced taxes for broad swaths of the workforce. Some small businesses may have been hit by new taxes that were part of Obama’s health law, but these would depend on the particular circumstances of each business. Also, there were new taxes on cigarettes and indoor tanning. Obama said he has "cut taxes for those who need it – middle-class families, small businesses." He has, but he also has raised some taxes. So while his statement is accurate, it lacks that additional context. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-09-07T00:27:40	2012-09-06	['None']
pomt-05898	Says Gov. Chris Christie’s proposal to reduce state income taxes "would be the second tax cut for the rich by the governor in two years."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/feb/05/paul-sarlo/chris-christies-proposed-income-tax-cuts-blasted-d/	A state income tax cut proposed by Gov. Chris Christie would provide greater savings to more affluent New Jerseyans, but according to Democratic state Sen. Paul Sarlo, that’s nothing new. As Sarlo sees it, the Republican governor has already cut taxes for the wealthy once before. At the start of the Jan. 30 Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee meeting, Sarlo, who serves as committee chairman, provided some opening remarks about how the governor’s proposal would disproportionately benefit high-income earners. "The proposed tax cut plan is measuring up as a potential billion-dollar gift for those who are high-income earners," Sarlo (D-Bergen) told his fellow legislators. "This would be the second tax cut for the rich by the governor in two years." If the latest proposal would be the second tax cut, what was the first? Sarlo told us in a phone interview that Christie cut taxes the first time when he vetoed a bill in 2010 to increase the income tax rate on taxable income exceeding $1 million, or the so-called "millionaires tax." But PolitiFact New Jersey found there’s a difference between stopping a tax increase and cutting taxes. The governor’s veto helped millionaires avoid a larger tax rate, but Christie has maintained the rates he inherited upon entering office in January 2010. Four economic experts also told us the governor’s veto doesn’t qualify as a "tax cut." First, let’s review the history behind the millionaires tax. In 2009, then-Gov. Jon Corzine, a Democrat, and the Democrat-controlled Legislature approved a one-year increase in some high-income tax rates. The higher rates were effective for tax year 2009 and reverted to their previous levels on Jan. 1, 2010 -- before Christie took office. A few months later, the Legislature passed a bill to increase the tax rate on taxable income exceeding $1 million from 8.97 percent to 10.75 percent. Christie immediately vetoed that bill and a related measure, and state Assembly Democrats later could not gather enough votes to override the vetoes. Through his veto, Christie "preserved the tax cut" provided when the higher rates expired at the end of 2009, according to Sarlo. But four economic experts argued that the governor’s veto should not be considered a tax cut. "I don’t believe that maintaining current law by vetoing the bill should be characterized as a tax cut," Jim Nunns, a senior fellow with the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, said in an email. "(Likewise, vetoing a bill that proposed some tax cut relative to current law should not be characterized as a tax increase.)" J. Fred Giertz, an economics professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, echoed the same argument: "Since the tax was never in place, the veto did not result in a tax decrease. The veto kept taxes the same and kept taxes from increasing." But Sarlo maintained that Christie’s veto led to a tax cut. "His actions resulted in the higher income brackets getting a reduced rate," Sarlo told us. "His actions resulted in a tax cut." Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts argued that Democrats could have renewed the millionaires tax before it expired at the end of 2009. "Factually, the tax surcharge (which I believe is what it technically was) expired under a Democratically controlled legislature and a Democratic Governor, before Governor Christie took the oath of office," Roberts told us in an email. "Pants on fire." Our ruling During a Senate committee meeting about Christie’s proposed income tax cut, Sarlo claimed: "This would be the second tax cut for the rich by the governor in two years." Sarlo was referring to Christie vetoing the proposed millionaires tax in 2010. But that veto just kept income tax rates at the same levels as when the governor took office. Those millionaires actually got their tax cut under a Democratic governor and the Democrat-controlled Legislature -- before Christie took office. Yet since Christie’s veto stopped a proposed tax increase from going through, we rate the statement Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-05685	Says there are four super PACs on the Republican side of the Texas U.S. Senate race.	true	/texas/statements/2012/mar/13/paul-sadler/paul-sadler-says-four-super-pacs-are-us-senate-rac/	At a candidate forum in Austin, Paul Sadler was asked if he’d support a constitutional amendment overturning the 2010 Supreme Court decision that touched off a flood of super PACs, a type of political action committee that cannot coordinate with a candidate’s campaign, but can independently spend unlimited donations to influence a race. "Hell yes, I will," Sadler said at the March 1, 2012, Travis County Democratic Party event. Calling the super PACs’ impact "scandalous," the lawyer and former Texas House member said: "In our race on the Republican side, already, there are four super PACs -- four super PACs -- and it is a distortion of our democracy." Such PACs are weighing in heavily this election season, raising eyebrows in some cases because they can accept money from certain tax-exempt groups that don’t have to disclose their donors’ names. According to the nonpartisan research group Center for Reponsive Politics’ opensecrets.org, super PACs have spent $65 million in the 2012 cycle so far supporting presidential candidates -- including President Barack Obama, who as PolitiFact noted February 7, 2012, executed a Full Flop in his stance on fundraising for super PACs. But four in our little ol’ U.S. Senate race? Jeff Rotkoff, spokesman for Sadler’s campaign to succeed retiring Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, told us the backup for his candidate’s statement was included in Sadler’s February 8, 2012, fundraising email, which cited in turn a Texas Tribune news story from the day before. That story listed four super PACs and linked them to candidates: Texas Conservatives Fund and Conservative Renewal Political Action Committee, supporting Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst; Real Street Conservatives, supporting Craig James; and Club for Growth Action PAC, supporting Ted Cruz. Like traditional PACs, super PACs register with the Federal Election Commission, which describes supers as "independent expenditure-only committees." Typically when a super PAC is created, the organizers attach a memo to the FEC stating their intent to make independent expenditures. The FEC website displays those memos for three of the PACs that Sadler referred to. For the fourth, we asked Club for Growth spokesman Barney Keller to confirm its super PAC status. Keller told us by email that the club’s Action PAC is its super PAC, distinct from its traditional Club for Growth PAC, which Keller said has endorsed Ted Cruz. So, yep: All four are supers. We set out to learn what we could about their activities. From websites and what the four PACs had reported to the FEC through March 6, 2012, we gleaned these thumbnails, keeping in mind that only the Club for Growth super PAC has existed long enough to have filed reports of contributions and expenditures: Texas Conservatives Fund: Created in January 2012 by Paul Kilgore, according to its statement of organization filed with the FEC. Kilgore, whom we reached by phone, is president of a campaign consulting firm in Athens, Ga. The PAC says on its website that its mission is to help Dewhurst get the GOP nomination and be elected to the U.S. Senate. Conservative Renewal Political Action Committee: Created in January 2012 by Larry Hicks, according to its statement of organization. A February 3, 2012, Houston Chronicle blog entry reported that the Conservative Renewal PAC would support Dewhurst. Hicks, whom we reached by phone, is a certified public accountant in Houston. Real Street Conservatives PAC: Created in February 2012 by Jerad Najvar, according to its statement of organization. Najvar, an election lawyer in Houston, told us by phone that he wasn’t authorized to state the PAC’s purpose or name the client who hired him to file the organizing documents. The Austin American-Statesman reported in a February 3, 2012, news blog post that a source had confirmed the Real Street Conservatives PAC supports James. Club for Growth Action: Created in August 2010 by Chris Chocola, according to its statement of organization. Chocola is president of the Washington, D.C.-based Club for Growth. The Club for Growth is a national conservative group that advocates economic growth. According to opensecrets.org, the group spent $5 million on Congressional races in the 2010 election cycle, using its cash for items such as television ads. In the 2012 election cycle, opensecrets.org shows the group has only spent $574,097 so far, but 82 percent, or $468,758, of that has been used against Dewhurst, the website records. So, yep: four supers, all linked to Republican candidates in the Texas U.S. Senate race. Sadler told us via email that he did not know of any such PACs supporting him. How would he respond if such a group formed? "Nothing I or anyone else can do -- I think that is the point, isn't it?," he wrote. We rate Sadler’s claim True.

pomt-05682	The "Democrat majority in the Senate has failed to submit [a] budget in the past 1,000 days."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2012/mar/14/johnny-isakson/isakson-democrats-failed-submit-budget-1000-days/	A favorite GOP talking point accusing Democrats of punting on the nation’s budget problems for the past 1,000 days has made its way to Georgia. The GOP devoted an entire video ad to it. U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, the Republican from Wisconsin who has won kudos from some deficit hawks, is churning out essays and press releases on it. And Georgia’s U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, a Republican, is putting his own spin on the subject. "I find it very troubling that the president is asking to increase the nation’s debt limit when his Democrat majority in the Senate has failed to submit [a] budget in the past 1,000 days," Isakson said in a Jan. 26 press release. That’s about three years. We grabbed our calculator and got to work with the help of our sister sites PolitiFact Florida and PolitiFact Wisconsin, who have analyzed other claims on the same subject. But before we proceed with our fact check, it helps to explain how Congress comes up with its federal budget. This is how it works: Since the passage of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Senate and the House are supposed to pass budget resolutions in the spring. These budget resolutions set a framework for spending, taxation and other fiscal items in the coming fiscal year. They also lay out general plans for the next four years. If these budget resolutions differ, the chambers are supposed to hammer out a compromise. If a budget resolution doesn’t pass, the federal government won’t go dark. Budget resolutions are distinct from appropriations bills, which actually allocate how the federal government spends its money. If a resolution tanks, the majority party can use congressional procedures to move forward to consider appropriations bills. As a previous PolitiFact National story said, "the inability to pass the budget framework can reflect poorly on the majority's organizational skills and/or the degree of partisan discord in Congress. It also increases the likelihood of a logjam of appropriations bills in the fall and winter, and decreases the chance that controversial tax bills will pass the Senate." Now, on to our fact check. Thanks to PolitiFact Florida and PolitiFact Wisconsin, we have a good sense of whether Isakson’s claim is accurate. Last year, George LeMieux, a Republican contender for U.S. Senate in Florida, posted on Twitter that it had been 750 days since his opponent and Senate Democrats "passed" a budget. LeMieux was referring to the last time the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats, passed a budget resolution. Indeed, the last time the Senate passed a budget resolution was in 2009 for the 2010 fiscal year, according to a report on the budget process by the Congressional Research Service. PolitiFact Florida rated this statement Half True. The candidate got the number of days right, but placing the blame on Senate Democrats wasn’t fair. Partisans on both sides share responsibility. Let’s move on to Jan. 23, about 250 days after LeMieux made his statement. Ryan, the Republican House member from Wisconsin, said Senate Democrats "have gone without any budget at all" for more than 1,000 days. Ryan’s language could have been more precise, PolitiFact Wisconsin ruled. It had been that long since a budget resolution passed, but not since the last Senate budget resolution expired. He earned a Mostly True. Isakson uses somewhat different wording from Ryan and LeMieux. He said that the Democratic majority in the Senate has failed to "submit" -- not pass -- a budget in the past 1,000 days. Democrats did submit a budget resolution since the last resolution passed, though it never went before the full Senate for a vote. We took a look at the Congressional Record, the official record of Congress’ proceedings. On April 26, 2010, under the heading "Submitted Resolutions," is S. Con. Res. 60, introduced by Sen. Kent Conrad of North Dakota. He’s a Democrat and head of the Senate Budget Committee. The resolution would have set forth the budget for 2011, but the Senate took no action after its date of submission. A resolution is "submitted" when its author formally presents it to the house of which he or she is a member, according to Congressional Quarterly’s American Congressional Dictionary, a widely used authority on language used in Congress. Instead of passing a typical budget resolution for 2011, Democrats passed one that would last for a single year. They said that they were waiting for a fiscal commission created by President Barack Obama to make its recommendations for debt reduction, according to news accounts at the time. In an email, Isakson spokeswoman Lauren Culbertson described Conrad’s submission of the budget resolution as a "gimmick." "It was never reported out of committee. It was never brought to the floor. It was not debated for even one hour," the email said. Federal law limits debate on a budget resolution to 50 hours. The Democrat-controlled Senate didn’t put a budget resolution up for a vote last year. And according to news accounts, they don’t intend to put one up this year, either. Isakson’s claim that the "Democrat majority in the Senate has failed to submit [a] budget in the past 1,000 days" needs some revision. No budget has been passed in the Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate. None has been put up for a vote in that time, either. But one was submitted April 26, 2010, or 640 days before Isakson issued his press release. That said, this flaw in Isakson’s statement doesn’t undermine his larger point. The budget resolution for 2011 languished. It never went up for a vote, and Democrats haven’t submitted one since. In the past few years, Senate Democrats have taken limited action on budget resolutions. The statement contains a kernel of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. It meets our definition of Mostly False.	None	Johnny Isakson	None	None	None	2012-03-14T06:00:00	2012-01-26	['None']

Rove, whose clients before Bush bid for governor included Hutchison, writes in his autobiography, “Courage and Consequence, My Life as a Conservative in The Fight”: “Kay Bailey Hutchison was elected state treasurer, succeeding Ann Richards. Democrats then abolished the position, which made me wonder if political payback is about the only grounds on which Democrats abolish government posts. Hutchison later became a U.S. senator.” The book was released March 9. Rove correctly reflects on Hutchison winning election as state treasurer in 1990, succeeding Richards, who won election as governor. However, we're intrigued by Rove’s statements about what happened next: According to him, Democrats then abolished the treasurer’s position. Later, Hutchison was elected to the U.S. Senate. Rove told us he stands by his account. Chronologically speaking, for starters, it's not so: Hutchison won her Senate seat in June 1993 while still serving as state treasurer, and the treasury remained a stand-alone agency after Hutchison left for Washington. Richards appointed an East Texas Democrat, Martha Whitehead, to serve out Hutchison’s term. Whitehead won election in her own right in 1994. So when -- and how -- was the treasurer's job abolished? According to legislative records, the Democratic-majority 1995 Legislature proposed a constitutional amendment abolishing the agency and shifting its operations elsewhere. Contrary to Rove's take, it wasn’t a move backed solely by Democrats. Senate Joint Resolution 1 was authored by Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, and sponsored in the House by Reps. Mark Stiles, D-Beaumont, and Bill Siebert, R-San Antonio. The proposed amendment cleared the Senate by 23-7 with five Republicans and two Democrats voting "no" and the House by 107-18 with several Republicans who voted “no” saying afterward they’d intended to vote “yes,” according to Senate and House journals. Texas voters approved the change by 69 percent to 31 percent in November 1995. And Whitehead--who’d campaigned for election vowing to eliminate the agency—marked her last day in office Aug. 31, 1996 by scraping her name and title off the glass front of the agency’s Austin headquarters. “I am the last treasurer of the State of Texas,” she said. Another Democrat, State Comptroller John Sharp, had proposed the agency’s abolition in a report issued in 1994, after Hutchison was already in the Senate. His report called the treasury a “bureaucracy with an annual operating budget of more than $11 million whose most important tasks are duplicated elsewhere across state government… Consolidating the bulk of the State Treasury's responsibilities with those of the Comptroller's office would cut costs, improve services and maintain accountability. It would also offer Texans the chance to prove that they're serious about reducing the size of their state government.” How does Rove’s statement shape up? As noted, he's correct that Hutchison succeeded Richards as treasurer. But he's wrong about the order of subsequent events, and assigns an unsupported motive—that Democrats abolished the agency because a Republican had its top spot. Some Republicans backed the abolition, too, and it was Hutchison’s Democratic successor whose stint in the office came to a sign-scraping close. We rate Rove’s poor job of retelling history as False.

pomt-12530	Says President Donald Trump as a candidate mentioned WikiLeaks "over 160 times in speeches" in the last month of the campaign.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/21/jackie-speier/did-trump-really-mention-wikileaks-over-160-times-/	President Donald Trump reveled in WikiLeaks’ disclosures against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton during the closing argument of his presidential campaign. His CIA director, Mike Pompeo, revealed a different attitude in a tough April 13 speech which addressed the anonymous hacking website. The group "walks like a hostile intelligence service and talks like a hostile intelligence service," Pompeo said. U.S. Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., was one of many voices who noticed the administration’s hardened view toward WikiLeaks. CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer interviewed Speier, a member of the House intelligence committee, on April 13 about Pompeo’s characterization of WikiLeaks. How much did Trump the candidate love WikiLeaks in the last days of the campaign? She attempted to count the ways. "If you recall during the election cycle, in the last month of the campaign, I believe that President Trump as a candidate hailed WikiLeaks as the new savior, had mentioned it over 160 times in speeches during that period of time. Really, that many times? We decided to check it out. WikiLeaks released tens of thousands of emails from the account of Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta in October 2016 and released thousands of emails from Democratic National Committee staffers in July 2016. Speier’s office said she was referring to a Jan. 7 article by left-leaning website ThinkProgress for her statement. Here’s how that article began: "President-elect Trump says that information published by WikiLeaks, which the U.S. intelligence community says was hacked by Russia, had ‘absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election.’ This was not the view of candidate Trump, who talked about WikiLeaks and the content of the emails it released at least 164 times in last month of the campaign." The article analyzed Trump’s "speeches, media appearances and debates" to get a tally of 164 mentions from Oct. 10 to Nov. 8. That number includes 124 times Trump mentioned the group by name, with the rest being mentions of the emails released by WikiLeaks. We set out on our own review, looking through transcripts from Congressional Quarterly by searching for the words "WikiLeaks" and "Trump," and limiting results to the last month of the campaign. We found Trump said the word "WikiLeaks" about 137 times in campaign rallies, interviews, speeches, his tweets and other social media presence, and debates. Speier’s figure of over 160 seems possible, however, because he often referenced disclosures from WikiLeaks without using the group’s name, and it’s possible there were interviews or speeches where Trump brought up WikiLeaks that our search didn’t return. At the time, Wikileaks steadily released a series of emails from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chairman. These emails were characterized by Trump and her other critics as showing Clinton held policy positions in private that were different from her public positions, that she received town hall topics in advance, and that they demonstrated negative internal dynamics inside the Clinton campaign. Trump repeatedly brought up the emails, encouraged his supporters to see them for themselves, and also described several revelations inaccurately. Let’s replay some of the biggest hits. "The WikiLeaks revelations have revealed a degree of corruption at the highest levels of our government like nothing we have ever seen as a country before," Trump said at a rally in Colorado on Oct. 29. "Hillary Clinton, as WikiLeaks proves, is a corrupt globalist," he said at a rally on Oct 21. "I love WikiLeaks," he said on Oct. 10. Trump has not said much publicly about WikiLeaks as president. The closest moment came during the transition. After receiving an intelligence briefing on Jan. 6, Trump released a statement that said "while Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election." He also brought up Donna Brazile’s passing of town hall topics to a Clinton staffer ahead of a primary debate in an interview with Time magazine on March 23, 2017. Our ruling Speier said Trump as a candidate mentioned WikiLeaks "over 160 times in speeches" in the last 30 days of the campaign. Official counts may vary, but her larger point is clear: Trump brought up WikiLeaks a lot in the waning days of the campaign. He has stayed largely mum about the group since taking office, even as his CIA director said WikiLeaks acts like a "hostile intelligence service." We rate this claim Mostly True. <a href="https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/13b3ef93-7755-4388-a286-c0f6e047d2e4">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/13b3ef93-7755-4388-a286-c0f6e047d2e4</a>	None	Jackie Speier	None	None	None	2017-04-21T15:01:43	2017-04-13	['WikiLeaks', 'Donald_Trump']
pomt-05847	"The U.S. Census believes that by 2030 the majority of Americans will use Spanish as their first language."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2012/feb/14/glee/ricky-martins-character-tv-show-glee-says-us-censu/	We’re gonna make this fact-check sing. Or -- since this fact-check was inspired by a Spanish teacher played by singer Ricky Martin on the TV show Glee -- we will make it cantar. Our fact-check is about how many people will be speaking Spanish as their first language in the year 2030. But before we hit play on our claim, we will catch you up with the show that follows a fictional Glee Club, named the New Directions, at a high school in Ohio. The show is about a group of musically talented misfits who belt out songs in between typical teenage plot twists about dating, spats with their parents, applying to college and the ever-present quest for popularity. The worst is getting "slushied," which means having slushy drinks tossed in their faces by cool football players. The cast of characters includes Artie, the bespectacled skinny guy in a wheelchair; Santana, the bad-ass Latina lesbian from the wrong side of town; Quinn, the blonde cheerleader/chastity club leader who gets pregnant; and many more. They are led by the Glee Club director/Spanish teacher William Schuester, who is on an annual quest to lead his club to victory at nationals. The plot of the Feb. 7, 2012, episode: Schuester enrolls in a night Spanish class taught by Ricky Martin’s character, David Martinez. (Yep, Mr. Schuester is a Spanish teacher whose Spanish es muy muy malo.) Martin tells his students that they need to learn Spanish to function in the U.S. in the future: "Do you know that the U.S. Census believes that by 2030 the majority of Americans will use Spanish as their first language?" (Here’s a clip of Martin singing "Sexy and I know It" and "La Isla Bonita" on the episode.) Schuester uses Spanish as the inspiration for his weekly assignment for the Glee Club: sing a song by a Spanish artist or that includes Spanish. We decided to take a short intermission from politics to test Glee’s claim about whether the Census Bureau believes the majority of Americans will speak Spanish as their first language by 2030. U.S. Census projects growth in Hispanic population Glee’s claim surprised the folks at the U.S. Census Bureau. "We don’t do projections of language spoken," on a regular official basis, said Robert Bernstein, a census spokesman. "That’s very strange someone would cite us." Bernstein pointed us to projections about the Hispanic population released in 2008 based on data from 2000. The census projected that by 2030 there will be about 85.9 million Hispanics out of about 373.5 million people in the U.S., representing about 23 percent of the population. That projection is compared to about 16 percent of the population (49.7 million people) in 2010. So it’s true that the Hispanic population in the U.S. is on track to grow. But the census projections are about the number of Hispanics -- not how many people will speak Spanish as their first language at home. Spanish spoken in U.S. in 2010 The American Community Survey, which is a part of the census program, provides estimates of population characteristics including language. For 2010, the survey showed about 37 million of 289 million people over age 5 spoke Spanish -- or about 13 percent. It doesn’t ask respondents what their "first" language is, but asks what they speak at home and how well they speak English. And those Spanish speakers include Hispanics and non-Hispanics. "We don’t know how frequently they speak one (language) or the other, or which one they use exclusively or first," said Tiffany Julian, an analyst with the Census Bureau. The survey also showed that for 2010, of the 45.6 million Hispanics, about 11.2 million speak only English while 34.3 million speak Spanish (including those who don’t speak English and those who speak English of varying ability.) That means 75 percent of Hispanics speak Spanish. So if we know in 2010 that 75 percent of Hispanics speak Spanish, we could apply that figure to the 85.9 million Hispanics projected for 2030. That would bring us to a projection of 64 million Hispanics speaking Spanish by 2030, and if we divided that into the overall projected population of 373.5 million, we find that Hispanic Spanish speakers would represent about one-sixth of the population. But what we’ve spelled out here is not a projection by ACS or the Census and may not be accurate: it’s pure math without taking into account any changes in immigration or fertility over the next two decades. Plus, we’ve also left out non-Hispanics who could speak Spanish at home as their first language. Paper on language projection At this point, we were about ready to say hasta la vista. But wait -- we found a couple of experts at the Census Bureau who took a stab at language projections and presented a paper at the Federal Forecasters Conference in April 2011. Their paper projects that somewhere between 13 and 15.3 percent of the age 5 and older population will speak Spanish by 2020 -- the last year cited in the paper. The authors of the paper, census demographer Jennifer Ortman and survey statistician Hyon Shin, told us that even if they projected out to 2030, the percentage of Spanish speakers likely would have continued to grow slightly -- but nowhere close to a majority of Americans speaking Spanish as their first language. "That is just blatantly wrong," the two agreed. "We don’t have anything that can support that." While nationwide immigrants typically continue to speak their native language, their children and grandchildren tend to use mostly -- if not only -- English. That means as the Hispanic population in the U.S. continues to grow, in part due to the descendants of immigrants, those children will speak English. Spanish is projected to remain the language spoken by a majority of what census researchers call "Language Other Than English" speakers. But "English is expected to continue to be the only language spoken by a substantial majority of all U.S. residents 5 years and older," the paper by the census experts said. Our ruling Ricky Martin’s character said on Glee, "The U.S. Census believes that by 2030 the majority of Americans will use Spanish as their first language." The Census Bureau predicts that in 2030 about 23 percent of the U.S. population will be Hispanic -- but all of those Hispanics in the future won’t speak Spanish as their first language. Two census researchers projected that somewhere between 13 and 15.3 percent of people in the U.S. will speak Spanish in 2020 -- a far cry from the majority of Americans, and we don’t know how many of those will speak it as their first language. They said the numbers from 2030 would still be nowhere close to the 50-percent mark. Ricky Martin may have looked good singing in his tight pants, but we’re going to light the show’s pants on fire anyway. Pants on Fire!

pomt-00906	"We have cut taxes more than 40 times in four years."	half-true	/florida/statements/2015/mar/03/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-he-cut-taxes-more-40-times/	Gov. Rick Scott has been touting his record of tax-cutting for years now, but in his March 3, 2015, State of the State address, he said he’s been pulling out the red pen even more. "We have cut taxes more than 40 times in four years," Scott said during his speech to open the 2015 legislative session. That’s a lot of instances of cutting Floridians’ taxes. Scott said during the 2014 gubernatorial campaign he’d cut taxes 40 times, but the "more" part piqued our interest. But what does Scott consider a tax cut, and how many times has he cut them? We took a closer look to try to break the code. Scott’s tally Scott said in 2013 he considered a tax cut to be a change that reduced government revenue by $3 million in any one year. He altered his definition in 2014 to include more revenue reductions for less than $3 million as tax cuts. That means he included things that weren’t, strictly speaking, an outright reduction in a single tax rate -- like sales tax holidays, stopping automatic fee hikes, tax credits and some temporary measures. He then counted each instance of some things every time they happened (so, for example, the annual back-to-school sales tax holiday is counted multiple times). Scott’s people didn’t get back to us with new information immediately, but in May 2014 they shared with us a list that included 41 items, so that may explain the "more than 40 times" part of it. In no particular order they are (with estimated savings in parentheses): 1, 2.) Unemployment compensation taxes: The Legislature reduced the number of weeks and payout for unemployment compensation in 2011 ($124.5 million). A tax increase for businesses was rolled back in 2012, although not eliminated. ($830 million for tax years 2012-14). 3, 4.) Manufacturing equipment: A 2012 sales tax exemption on machinery purchases was expanded ($56 million). In 2013, the Legislature eliminated the sales tax entirely for three years, starting April 30, 2014 ($370 million in state taxes and and $83 million in local government taxes through 2017). 5.) Property taxes: Scott and legislators forced most state water management districts to reduce their property tax collections by 30 percent in 2011 ($210 million). 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.) Sales tax holiday: Scott counted the mostly annual tax-free shopping holiday four different times prior to 2013. It applied to shoes and clothing up to $75 per item and school supply purchases up to $15. The state has offered the holiday every year since 1998 except in 2002, 2003, 2008 and 2009. The Aug. 2-4 tax holiday counted twice, according to Scott, because it also exempted sales taxes on electronic equipment, such as E-readers, laptops and tablets, up to $750 (about $30 million for all four holidays). For 2014, there were three sales tax holidays: From May 31-June 8, 2014, for Floridians to buy hurricane preparedness supplies without paying 6 percent ($2.9 million); A three-day back-to-school shopping period from Aug. 1-3 was for clothes worth $100 or less, school supplies worth $15 or less, or on the first $750 of the cost of a personal computer (about $30 million); and Sept. 19-21 on the purchase of energy- and water-efficient appliances costing $1,500 or less (about $1.7 million). 13, 14.) Corporate Income Tax exemptions: Lawmakers expanded the exemption for corporate income taxes from $5,000 to $25,000 in 2011, and then all the way up to $50,000 in 2012 (about $60 million). 15.) Tax credit scholarships: A program that gives businesses a tax credit if they purchase tuition vouchers for low-income families to go to private schools was expanded ($25 million). 16, 17, 18.) Energy breaks: A 2013 law implemented part of a 2008 constitutional amendment that says a property appraiser may not base an increase in a property’s just value on the installation of a "renewable energy source device," including windmills, solar panels and roof pools (local revenue losses of $12.6 million by 2017). Two other tax credits from 2012 aimed at helping agribusiness and renewable energy production facilities are set to expire in 2016. Scott allowed the bill to become law without his signature. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.) Various business tax incentives: Since 2011, Scott and the Legislature have expanded tax credits available to businesses under a federal/state "new markets" program, allowing businesses to take it against their corporate income tax bill or insurance premium tax bill ($12.9 million per year). They’ve allowed companies that spent at least $250 million on capital costs from 2011-13 to write-down a portion of their Florida business taxes ($7.5 million). They temporarily waived a requirement that a new facility creating at least 100 jobs be in certain technology fields in order to qualify for the Capital Investment Tax Credit, though only if they are located in certain Panhandle counties. The exemption lasted through June 30, 2014 ($4.4 million per year). They also created an annual corporate income tax credit for certain research and development expenses (up to $9 million a year). In 2014 businesses won a small decrease on the tax rate on electricity ($3 million) and allowed a sales tax refund on bad credit card debt (about $6.7 million). 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33.) Targeted breaks: Lawmakers eliminated sales taxes on repairs to planes between 2,000 and 15,000 pounds ($12.3 million). The same bill tweaked requirements for a tax credit for businesses in an urban high-crime area ($3.5 million per year). The Legislature blocked a July 2013 automatic inflation adjustment factored in registration for hunting and fishing license fees every five years ($4.4 million for 2012-13). A wide-ranging 2012 law eliminated the annual adjustment and surcharge for severing phosphate ($12.6 million annually). A person licensed as a real estate salesperson or broker associate does not have to apply for an exemption from a local business tax when he or she is an employee of someone else under a 2012 law ($3.8 million from local government per year). A portion of the 2014 tax cut package clarified how prepaid calling plans were taxed ($7.2 million). It also contained provisions to cut taxes for premiums on bail bonds ($700,000) and title insurance ($5.4 million). The bill also extended and increased financial incentives for businesses to donate to community development and housing projects for low-income residents by providing a tax credit or sales tax refund ($14.7 million). 34.) Communications dealers: A 2012 law spared communications dealers, in certain situations, from being liable for penalties if they assign a customer to the wrong local tax jurisdiction ($4.7 million annually). 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40.) Sales tax exemptions: The tax cut package from 2014’s HB 5601 included several exemptions for more than just businesses. There was a temporary $3.3 million cut for the purchase of cement mixing drums for cement trucks, but the list also includes child car seats and youth bike helmets (about $2.5 million), prescribed diet pet food (another $2.5 million or so) and prepaid college meal plans (about $12 million). These exemptions are in effect until 2017. 41.) Car registration fees: In 2014, the Legislature rolled back the 2009 annual auto tag fee increase. Those fees had gone up to deal with a budget shortfall. The fee cut took effect in September 2014 and saves motorists about $25 a year per vehicle registration (about $395 million annually). Adding it up So that totals 41, but do they really count as tax cuts? It depends on how you look at it, experts have told PolitiFact Florida. If you’re a business, some of the changes are a real benefit. But if you’re a regular, taxpaying Floridian, there’s not a whole lot here for you -- especially if you need to collect unemployment. Sales tax holidays can change from year to year, and exemptions are temporary. Tax credits only save you money if you spend it somewhere else, and preventing property appraisals from going up if you improve the property means you still have to improve the property. Ending a fee increase isn’t so much a cut as it is saving people from paying more for something they have to pay anyway, like a hunting or fishing license. And don’t forget that many times, local governments may raise taxes to make up for their own lost revenue. Scott has requested several tax changes for 2015, but it is up to the Legislature to approve them. Our ruling Scott said, "We have cut taxes more than 40 times in four years." A list his office sent us last year with 41 things they considered tax cuts likely explains that sum. But the list is full of esoteric tax credits, changes in unemployment compensation and sales tax holidays that don’t meet the purest definition of a tax cut. Scott’s tax claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2015-03-03T17:21:24	2015-03-03	['None']
pomt-08564	Independent groups behind ads attacking Democratic candidates are "front groups for foreign-controlled companies."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/28/david-axelrod/david-axelrod-independent-groups-behind-ads-attack/	On ABC's This Week on Sept. 26, 2010, David Axelrod was asked about the growing influence of Republican strategist Karl Rove, former adviser to President George W. Bush, who is affiliated with American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS, organizations that are spending millions on ads attacking Democratic candidates. "Here's the thing about Karl Rove and what he's doing," said Axelrod, senior adviser to President Barack Obama said. "The insidious thing about it is they are funding negative ads all over the country against Democratic candidates paid for by major corporate special interests who don't have to disclose their participation, the oil industry, Wall Street, insurance industry. "We put a bill in the United States Congress asking one thing -- and this was a loophole that was opened by the Supreme Court earlier in this year -- we put a bill in the Congress saying, disclose who is funding these campaigns. Let the American people know who's paying for these ads. It's a very simple premise." Axelrod is talking here about the 5-4 ruling by the Supreme Court on Jan. 21, 2010 in the landmark case Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission, which struck down barriers to corporations spending money directly from their own treasuries to influence elections. And the bill that Axelrod said would close that loophole is the Democracy is Strengthened by Casting Light on Spending in Elections (DISCLOSE) Act, which was recently derailed in the Senate. According to Axelrod, these independent groups are "spending tens of millions of dollars. In some districts, they're spending more money than the candidates themselves on negative ads from benign-sounding Americans for Prosperity, the American Crossroads Fund. No. These are front groups for special interests. These are front groups for foreign-controlled companies, which would have been banned under the bill that we put through Congress, and they don't want the American people to know, and the American people ought to be alert to that." The fact we are checking here is whether some of the independent groups supporting Republican candidates are front groups for foreign-controlled companies. White House officials said that the two groups Axelrod cited by name -- Americans for Prosperity and the American Crossroads Fund -- were examples of "front groups for special interests," but not necessarily fronts for foreign-controlled companies. According to media reports, Americans for Prosperity is funded by oil magnates David and Charles Koch; and American Crossroads is a group created by GOP strategists Karl Rove and Ed Gillespie. According to a story in Roll Call, American Crossroads is almost entirely funded by 10 wealthy donors and corporations, including $1 million from a Dallas-based oil and gas executive. While the source of American Crossroads' money must ultimately be disclosed, many of the donors may not be known until after the elections. Crossroads GPS, on the other hand, was formed as an IRS code 501(c)4 non-profit, which must spend most of its money on issues rather than candidates, but does not have to disclose its donors. In other words, we don't really know where some of these groups and others funding the negative ads are getting their money. "The fundamental problem following Citizens United is that it is difficult to determine who is sponsoring these groups," said White House spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield. "And that comes at the expense of the American people, who no longer have the right to know who is financing these ads in an attempt to influence an election for their preferred candidate. Wall Street, the insurance lobby, oil companies and other special interests are now one step closer to taking Congress back and returning to the days when lobbyists wrote the laws. And that’s the point Axelrod is making here. He’s referring generally to front groups and lists Americans for Prosperity and American Crossroads as two specific examples of incorporated entities that can now use corporate money to pay for electioneering communications in light of the Citizens United decision. They don’t represent every single kind of incorporated entity that Axelrod is referring to; they’re just two examples of front groups with benign-sounding names." So far, it remains to be seen how much, if any, money comes from foreign companies. In January, 2010 PolitiFact looked into a claim from President Obama that the Citizens United case opened the floodgates for special interests -– including foreign corporations. We found that the president had overstated the decision's immediate impact and rated it Barely True. It is a matter of intense legal debate. In the Citizens United case, the majority justices left intact current federal law that prevents "a partnership, association, corporation, organization, or other combination of persons organized under the laws of or having its principal place of business in a foreign country" from making "directly or indirectly" a donation or expenditure "in connection with a Federal, State, or local election," to a political party committee or "for an electioneering communication." But the minority justices in that case warned the ruling could lead to foreign companies exerting influence. Some legal experts we spoke to said that the ruling could open the door to foreign companies spending on American campaigns, given the general direction of the majority's opinion. We concluded then that "until test cases proceed and further rulings are handed down, Obama's claim about foreign campaign spending is a reasonable interpretation, and nothing more." White House officials could not provide evidence that any of the groups funding campaign-related ads are fronts for foreign-controlled companies. Rather, they said, the issue was raised as a hypothetical problem created by the Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court. Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, said it's "possible" that donations could come from a foreign-controlled company. "I'm certainly concerned this cycle because some of these donors fly under the radar," she said. However, she said. "I know of no specific organization that is foreign-controlled. I think (Axelrod) was incorrect if he said that. It is a legitimate thing to be concerned about. There have been many examples of it happening in the past. But I don't think there is any evidence of that happening." Democratic lawmakers sought, in part, to definitively close the door on foreign money through the DISCLOSE Act. "The problem with our political system is that we don't have any idea where any of the money that is going to these groups that funds these ads is coming from," said Doug Thornell, a spokesman for Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the Democrats' House campaign committee chief. "The DISCLOSE Act would have provided the American people with an important tool to use to find out who is trying to influence these upcoming elections." Section 102 of the DISCLOSE Act detailed how it would prevent foreign influence in U.S. elections. Again, the bill stalled in the Senate. With regard to the financial backing for some of the attack ads against Democrats, we think Obama's wording was more accurate when he said in a fund-raising speech in Philadelphia on Sept. 20, 2010, "The names always sound very benign - it's 'Americans for Prosperity,' 'Committee for Truth in Politics,' 'Americans for Apple Pie' -- I made that last one up. None of them will disclose who is paying for these ads. You don't know whether it's some big financial interest; you don't know if it's a big oil company, or an insurance company. You don't even know if it's foreign controlled." Obama here warned the groups could be using money from entities that are foreign controlled. Axelrod went one step further and said they are front groups for foreign-controlled companies. That might make for a powerful sound bite, but it's a concern, not a known fact.

pomt-00409	"This year West Virginia produced more AmeriCorps members than any other state."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/31/joe-manchin/does-west-virginia-produce-most-americorps-members/	Is West Virginia the largest source of members for AmeriCorps, a federally run network of national service programs that operate in communities to mentor youth, fight poverty, sustain national parks, and prepare for disasters? Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said so in a tweet on Aug. 8, 2018: "West Virginians look out for one another and our commitment to service speaks for itself. This year West Virginia produced more @americorps members than any other state. Do you know an AmeriCorps member? Thank them for their service!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We wondered whether Manchin was correct that West Virginia produces more AmeriCorps members than any other state. On its website, AmeriCorps published a study listing the states that produced the most AmeriCorps volunteers for 2018. Here’s the list, which ranks the states based on a per-capita measurement, so that larger-population states don’t dominate the rankings: Rank State 1. West Virginia 2. Washington, D.C. 3. Minnesota 4. Utah 5. Vermont 6. Montana 7. Hawaii 8. New Mexico 9. Massachusetts 10. Maryland This is the first time West Virginia has ranked first. In 2017 and 2016, it ranked third, and in 2015, it ranked fifth. So why does West Virginia rank so high? History, said Dana Bryant, a spokeswoman for Volunteer West Virginia, the state's commission for national and community service. National service programs like AmeriCorps "have a long history in West Virginia, from the Civilian Conservation Corps of the 1930s to southern coalfield (Volunteers in Service to America) fighting poverty in the 1960s to the creation of AmeriCorps in 1993," she said. In West Virginia, "volunteering is just a way of life," she said. West Virginia also received benefits from AmeriCorps. In 2017, the agency said, more than 3,800 people undertook national service in 600 locations across West Virginia and $12.2 million was invested, including "reducing crime and reviving cities, connecting veterans to services, fighting the opioid epidemic, helping seniors live independently, and rebuilding communities after disasters." Our ruling Manchin tweeted, "This year West Virginia produced more AmeriCorps members than any other state." AmeriCorps data confirms West Virginia’s first-place rating per capita for 2018, the first time the state ranked first since the agency began publishing the data in 2015. We rate the statement True.

pomt-06376	Says Mitt Romney flip-flopped on abortion.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/02/jon-huntsman/Says-Mitt-Romney-flip-flopped-on-abortion/	To make fun of Mitt Romney for flip-flopping, a new web ad from former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman uses a wind-up monkey. In one side-by-side video comparison, the ad shows video of Romney first saying, "I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country," then saying, "I have consistently been pro-life." Clearly, the ad is charging Romney with flip-flopping on abortion. So we decided to see whether the charge is accurate. First, let’s look at some of the things Romney said earlier in his career about abortion, when he was waging a losing bid for a U.S. Senate seat in Massachusetts and winning the governorship a few years later. Here are two of the clearest statements of his position. • In a debate during his 1994 race against Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy, Romney said, "I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country." Referring to the 1973 Supreme Court decision that lmade abortion legal in every state, Romney added, "I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years, it should be sustained and supported. And I sustain and support that law and support the right of a woman to make that choice." • In his 2002 campaign for governor, Romney said during a debate, "I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard." We believe that these two comments -- made in highly public forums and eight years apart -- represent pretty solid evidence that Romney was an abortion-rights supporter during that phase of his political career. What about his views today? The "issues" portion of his website doesn’t list abortion, but Romney wrote a June 18, 2011, op-ed in the conservative National Review that lays out his abortion views pretty clearly. It was written after he risked alienating anti-abortion activists by declining to sign a pledge offered by the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group. "I am pro-life and believe that abortion should be limited to only instances of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. I support the reversal of Roe v. Wade, because it is bad law and bad medicine. Roe was a misguided ruling that was a result of a small group of activist federal judges legislating from the bench. I support the Hyde Amendment, which broadly bars the use of federal funds for abortions. And as president, I will support efforts to prohibit federal funding for any organization like Planned Parenthood, which primarily performs abortions or offers abortion-related services. "I will reinstate the Mexico City Policy to ensure that nongovernmental organizations that receive funding from America refrain from performing or promoting abortion services as a method of family planning, in other countries. This includes ending American funding for any United Nations or other foreign assistance program that promotes or performs abortions on women around the world. "I will advocate for and support a Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act to protect unborn children who are capable of feeling pain from abortion. And perhaps most importantly, I will only appoint judges who adhere to the Constitution and the laws as they are written, not as they want them to be written." Our ruling Abortion opponents may disagree on exactly where on the anti-abortion spectrum Romney falls, and questions have been raised about how fully and quickly Romney made his ideological transition after the event he cites as the spark -- a meeting with a Harvard stem-cell researcher in 2004. Still, we believe these issues are outside the scope of the claim in Huntsman’s ad. Simply put, Romney’s views on abortion are vastly different today than what he expressed in the 1994 and 2002 debates. Huntsman’s claim that Mitt Romney flip-flopped on abortion rates a True.

pomt-06997	Says many public-employee unions falsely told their Wisconsin members his budget-repair bill sought 12 percent to 13 percent of their incomes for health insurance premiums.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jul/10/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-public-employee-unions-false/	Gov. Scott Walker loves playing political pundit, so he was ready with talking points when a CNBC interviewer asked him if he could resurrect popularity polls numbers that "are in the toilet." Walker predicted his numbers would turn around as protests over his battle with public employee unions die down and people realize his 2011-’13 budget wasn’t the end of the world. And he blamed unions for a disinformation campaign for tainting the public’s view of the plan, which forces public employees to pay more for pensions and health care costs. "In many cases, many of the national unions told their members things that just don't add up," Walker told "Squawk Box" co-anchor Joe Kernen on June 21, 2011. "They told them, for example, that the health insurance premium (contributions) we were asking for were a percentage of their incomes, not of their premiums." "Well that’s a big difference," Walker continued. "If you’re asked to pay 12 to 13 percent of your actual salary, that’s a huge amount..." That certainly is a big difference. Walker’s claim is a variation on a theme advanced by Republicans, that national union leaders were pulling the strings here in order to boost the size and duration of the Capitol protests. But it puts an awfully specific spin on it. When we asked for backup, Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie said they had no documentation of unions making that claim to members. He said Walker as heard this privately from teachers around the state, though he did not identify any individual teachers. That leaves it to us to see what evidence there may be. A bit of background before we begin: In December, after the election, Walker spoke publicly about his plan to seek greater health and pension contributions. He repeated that during his state of the state speech Feb. 1. And less than two weeks later, he unveiled the plan as part of his budget-repair bill. After unprecedented protests -- and the departure of 14 Democratic senators to Illinois -- the plan won final approval on March 9, 2011. It then survived a legal challenge at the Supreme Court over the manner in which it was approved -- and there may be more battles to come. A central part of the plan: Requiring most state and local public employees to pay at least 12 percent of the cost of their health insurance premiums. It is a big deal for workers. As the issue was debated, we found in an earlier item, the average state employee was paying about 4 percent to 6 percent of the premium. Local government workers’ costs varied by municipality or school district. Walker’s plan also called for workers to pay more toward their pensions -- a contribution of about 5.8 percent of their salary. Note the difference: the pension contribution was a percentage of salary, and the health change was percentage of total premium. The governor’s office -- and reporters -- soon began reporting the combined impact on workers’ paychecks, because in the end that’s where the money would come from. In effect, it is a reduction in pay. In our review, we found a range. Depending on their incomes and health insurance choices, workers would see a 6.8 percent to 12.9 percent hit from the combined changes. With all these numbers floating around, the opportunity for confusion was there. In fact, scattered media reports got the health-insurance change wrong, reporting it as a percentage of income. And we previously found one falsehood on health insurance that circulated briefly in an email, but it involved Walker’s separate two-year budget, not the repair bill. Some state corrections employees, including a dentist who leads unionized state professionals, thought the budget forced workers to pay 100 percent of health costs, but that email rumor was quickly debunked by the state’s largest public-sector union, and separately by PolitiFact Wisconsin. The issue here is how the big unions described Walker’s health change to their members. Those unions were the subject of Walker’s misinformation claim. We reviewed dozens of public communications -- web postings, email alerts and press releases -- between the various unions and their members, as well as to the general public. We also looked for private communications, some of which surfaced publicly. The ones we found all accurately described the impact of the plan. A few examples: The Wisconsin State Employees Union, part of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), got it right. Same for the state’s largest teachers union, the Wisconsin Education Association Council, the National Education Association, AFT-Wisconsin and Madison Teachers Inc. Marty Beil, head of the Wisconsin State Employees Union, said his 22,000 members understood Walker’s plan very clearly. "For him to say that is just misleading as hell," Beil said. "There was no misunderstanding." Let’s finish up. Walker blamed union disinformation for what he said was confusion about his health insurance plan in his budget repair bill. He squarely blamed big unions, and described the problem as widespread. But Walker offered no tangible evidence for his claim. And our check of the communications by the big unions found no instances of unions falsely portraying his plan as a percentage of income. If any additional information surfaces, we may revisit this ruling. But based on the information available, and the lack of documentation from Walker, we rate the statement False.

pomt-04078	"Nearly a quarter of all adults in this state have some college credit without a degree."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jan/21/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-nearly-quarter-wisconsin-adu/	In his third "state of the state" speech, Gov. Scott Walker recounted leaving Marquette University in 1990 without a degree when he went to work full-time at the American Red Cross. That year, Walker also was busy launching his political career with an unsuccessful bid for state Assembly in Milwaukee. He later married and had two children, thwarting his plan to "squeeze in a course here or there and finish things off in a year or two," he recalled. Twenty years later, after stints in state and county government, Walker won the governorship. And on Jan. 15, 2013, he used the "state of the state" speech to promote his efforts to help the University of Wisconsin System create a new online degree program for working adults seeking a less costly and faster way to finish off a degree. It’s a program Walker has said he eventually may use to complete his own degree. Walker attended Marquette for four years and would have needed to stay at least another year to get a degree, according to a letter his 2010 campaign released. Walker said in the speech his situation is far from unique, noting "nearly a quarter of all adults in this state have some college credit without a degree." Amid the debate over workforce development and retaining college graduates, is Wisconsin home to that many people who started but did not finish college? When asked for backup, Walker’s office pointed us to a 2011 policy brief by the private Indianapolis-based Lumina Foundation, which pushes nationally for an increase in the number of college graduates. Of Wisconsin residents aged 25 to 64, an estimated 22.8 percent reported having some college credits but no degree, according to the group. The report is dated January 2011 and uses 2008 U.S. Census Bureau data compiled annually from the American Community Survey. (As a point of comparison, the same year, 38 percent of Wisconsin adults in that age range held at least a two-year degree, the report found.) We confirmed the 22.8 percent figure using the Census Bureau’s "American Fact Finder" site. That’s the figure Walker described as "nearly a quarter." We checked for more recent numbers, from 2011, and got a very similar number: 22.5 percent. That’s as close to one-fifth as it is to Walker’s description of "nearly a quarter." But still within rounding range. The figure represents about 684,000 people reporting post-secondary credit but no college degree. Women slightly outnumbered men in the group. "College" includes technical schools. The Wisconsin numbers very closely mirror the situation in the United States as a whole. The Lumina analysis cited by Walker excludes adults under 25 and those over 64. That’s a bit at odds with Walker talking about nearly a quarter of "all adults." But two researchers we spoke with said it was reasonable to use that age range for the comparison being made. Many adults under 25 are going to school, so excluding them from the analysis makes sense, said Dale Knapp, research director at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. And if the governor views the program as a workforce development tool, it’s fair to analyze the situation using a figure that focuses on people under 65, said Noel Radomski, managing director of the Wisconsin Center for the Advancement of Postsecondary Education. The UW online program, which launches in fall 2013 at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, will be open to adults of any age, but the "target market" is clearly working-age adults who want and need a more convenient way to attain their degree, said UW System spokesman David Giroux. Another study we examined, "College Completion in Wisconsin: The Impact on the Workforce and The Economy," used the same age range as the Lumina report. The "College Completion" report found that Wisconsin was second in the nation in high school completion rates, but 36th in high school graduates going straight to college. Our rating Touting a new flexible online option for finishing college degrees, Walker said that "nearly a quarter of all adults in this state have some college credit without a degree." His cautiously worded estimate is in range, with the clarification that he meant adults under 65 and over 24. The number who have some credit is 22.5 percent in the most recent data; Walker cited a study that used 2008 data and put the number at 22.8 percent. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-11948	Says Winston Churchill said, "A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on."	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/oct/09/colin-kaepernick/nfls-colin-kaepernick-incorrectly-credits-winston-/	Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, apparently responding to a TV report he considered incorrect, tweeted a quote about lying that he attributed to British leader Winston Churchill. Like every good play in football, let’s set up our formation: During the 2016 season, Kaepernick knelt during the Star-Spangled Banner to protest racial inequality. He then opted out of his 49ers contract and has not been re-signed. Many people think Kaepernick has been blacklisted by the NFL for his protests. USA Today and ESPN then reported in March that Kaepernick would stand during the national anthem. The stories both used anonymous sources, because Kaepernick had not (and as of this writing, still has not) spoken publicly about whether he would continue his protests. On Oct. 8, 2017, CBS Sports reporter Jason La Canfora told The NFL Today host James Brown that Kaepernick wanted to play in the NFL again. Brown asked La Canfora, who said he had spoken to Kaepernick the night before, whether the quarterback would continue to kneel in protest. "He's not planning on kneeling," La Canfora answered. That garnered some attention in the sports world, but upon further review, La Canfora walked back his remarks. He clarified his answer via Twitter shortly after the broadcast, writing that that he had not actually asked Kaepernick about his protests. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com In an apparent response to La Canfora, Kaepernick tweeted the quote later that day. "A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on. Winston S. Churchill," he wrote. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com But we have to throw a flag on this one, because there’s no evidence that Churchill ever said it — although the British Bulldog does often get the credit. Tim Riley, director of the National Churchill Museum at Westminster College in Fulton, Mo., said Kaepernick is not the first to make this mistake. This and other misattributed Churchill quotes often spread online, he said. "The irony is that today such misattributed quotes circle the globe a thousand times before the truth even begins to think about putting on pants," Riley said. Churchill historian Richard Langworth found the saying traced back to President Franklin Roosevelt’s secretary of state, Cordell Hull, who wrote: "A lie will gallop halfway round the world before the truth has time to pull its breeches on." Langworth also noted Churchill would have said trousers, not breeches, so there’s that. But we’re still only partially dressed with that explanation. This quote has dozens of variations, stretching back quite some time. If we go to 1919, Mark Twain got credit for saying, "A lie can travel around the world and back again while the truth is lacing up its boots." (Samuel Clemens died in 1910, by the way.) Baptist preacher Charles Haddon Spurgeon allegedly used a version with boots in it back in 1855. The saying sometimes substitutes shoes. In 1840, it was credited to Thomas Jefferson. There’s an entire history of the saying on QuoteInvestigator.com, citing sources that attribute versions of it to all manner of outlets, from magazines to Chinese proverbs. The origins of the quote reach all the way back to the 18th century. One version is attributed to English clergyman Thomas Francklin. "Falsehood will fly, as it were, on the wings of the wind, and carry its tales to every corner of the earth; whilst truth lags behind; her steps, though sure, are slow and solemn," he wrote in a 1787 sermon. But Bonnie Taylor-Blake, a neuroscience researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and amateur etymologist, told PolitiFact that she and other word investigators found a probable origin with no mention of boots or pants. "Falsehood flies, and the truth comes limping after it," Jonathan Swift wrote in The Examiner in 1710. "I should note that it's possible, though maybe not terribly likely, that the metaphor wasn't entirely Swift's," Taylor-Blake said. "He may have adapted it from an earlier, now-unknown form, even a version not then in English." Our ruling Kaepernick credited Churchill for saying, "A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on." This is a quote that often is attributed to the British prime minister, but there’s no record of him saying it. But that’s a common mistake, experts told us. The line has grown and evolved — and then credited to different people — many times over hundreds of years, potentially starting with a version by Swift in 1710. This is a broken play by Kaepernick. We rate it False. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com	None	Colin Kaepernick	None	None	None	2017-10-09T17:21:07	2017-10-08	['None']
pomt-11180	"So far this year, more students have been killed in schools than soldiers in combat zones."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2018/may/21/gwen-graham/have-more-students-been-killed-schools-soldiers-co/	After a student gunman killed 10 people in Santa Fe, Texas, a claim circulated widely on social media that compared the number of deaths in the military with the number of deaths in school shootings. One of the politicians who shared it on social media was Gwen Graham, a former Democratic member of the U.S. House who is now running for governor of Florida. In a May 18 Facebook post, Graham wrote, "So far this year, more students have been killed in schools than soldiers in combat zones. We are WAY past the point of talking. We need action now." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Graham’s post linked to an article by Philip Bump of the Washington Post titled "2018 has been deadlier for schoolchildren than service members." The article found that "more people have been killed at schools this year than have been killed while serving in the military." We wanted to look at the data ourselves. Graham’s formulation was a bit narrower than the newspaper’s: Her post said "students" rather than individuals "at schools," and "in combat zones" rather than "while serving in the military." Either of the definitions is plausible; as it happens, Graham’s parameters make an even stronger case than the Post article does. Students killed in school shootings We found five shooting incidents that resulted in student fatalities in 2018. The figures below do not include adults slain in these incidents, because they are outside the scope of Graham’s statement. Benton, Ky., Jan. 23, 2018: 2 students killed Parkland, Fla., Feb. 14, 2018: 14 students killed Birmingham, Ala., March 7, 2018: 1 student killed Great Mills, Md., March 20, 2018: 1 student killed Santa Fe, Texas, May 18, 2018: 8 students killed Total: 26 students killed in school shootings through May 18, 2018. (Including the adults killed would raise the count to 31 total fatalities.) Members of the military killed in combat zones There are two active combat operations for the U.S. military: Operation Inherent Resolve, which includes anti-ISIS efforts in Iraq and Syria, and Operation Freedom’s Sentinel, which includes military activities in Afghanistan. In 2018, there have been five deadly incidents in Operation Inherent Resolve, on Jan. 8, Feb. 19, March 7, March 15, and March 30. Each of these incidents resulted in one American service member’s death, except for the one on March 15, in which seven airmen died in the crash of an HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopter in western Iraq. So the total number of deaths in 2018 for Operation Inherent Resolve is 11. Meanwhile, there have been two deaths this year in Operation Freedom’s Sentinel. They occurred on Jan. 1 and April 30. Total: 13 service members were killed in combat zones in 2018. That's half the number of student deaths in school shootings this year. Some caveats The first caveat to consider is that today’s snapshot in time is unusual in recent history. Specifically, the number of school-shooting deaths is unusually high in 2018, according to the Post’s database of school shootings. Through May 18 of 2017, there were two deaths in school shootings. Through May 18 of 2016, it was one; for 2015 it was zero; and for 2014 it was one. Looking at full-year totals, the Post article found that the number of military deaths in 2017 exceeded 30, compared to five school-shooting deaths. The second caveat to know involves the death rate — that is, deaths divided by the total population at risk of death. The death rate remains significantly higher for members of the military in combat zones. There are currently an estimated 50.8 million students enrolled in K-12 classes. That’s vastly larger than the combination of personnel serving in the two military operations cited above, which is less than 20,000 people, according to publicly disclosed data. The Post article that Graham linked to made this point. "The figures for 2018 do not suggest schools are more dangerous than combat zones," the article said. "So far in 2018, a member of the military has been about 40 times as likely to be killed as someone is to die in a school shooting." Our ruling Graham wrote, "So far this year, more students have been killed in schools than soldiers in combat zones." On the numbers, she is right. This year at least, within Graham’s stated parameters, exactly twice as many students have died in school shootings than military personnel have died in combat zones. It is important to know, however, the likelihood of being killed in a combat zone is still vastly higher than it is in a school. The statement is accurate but needs additional information. That meets our definition of Mostly True. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Gwen Graham	None	None	None	2018-05-21T15:35:56	2018-05-18	['None']
pomt-14370	Senate Democrats "have never held up a Supreme Court nomination."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/20/harry-reid/harry-reid-says-unlike-gop-senate-democrats-never-/	NBC Meet the Press’ Chuck Todd said there’s a degree of hypocrisy to the Democrats’ assertion that the Republicans have a constitutional duty to have hearings and vote on President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee. Senate Republicans have declared that they will not even hold hearings on Obama’s pick, Merrick Garland, chief judge of the federal court of appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has argued that Republicans’ behavior is a dereliction of the Senate’s constitutional duty to "advise and consent" the president on his nominee. But on Meet the Press, Todd presented Reid with a clip from 2005, in which Reid said, "Nowhere in that document (the Constitution) does it say the Senate has a duty to give presidential nominees a vote." Todd, who also asked Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to explain his own clash with past positions, asked Reid what changed. "You have to look at what has happened," Reid replied. "We have never held up a Supreme Court nomination. Since 1900 in a lame-duck session, there have been six that have all been approved." Reid’s claim that the Democrats "have never held up a Supreme Court nomination" gave Todd and us pause, so we decided to put it on the Truth-O-Meter. Reid has a point that the degree of opposition to Garland is unprecedented, but Democrats have offered their fair share of strong opposition to Republican presidents’ nominees in recent history. They started it! Since the 1960s, the Senate has held a hearing for nearly every Supreme Court nominee, the exception being Harriet Miers, a 2005 George W. Bush nominee who faced opposition from Democrats and Republicans alike. So when McConnell vowed, within hours of Justice Antonin Scalia’s death, not to even consider the yet-to-be-named replacement, it was an unprecedented degree of opposition. And, no, there’s no tradition of not nominating a justice during a presidential election year. It’s generally accepted, though, that the modern political battle over Supreme Court seats started with Democratic opposition to Robert Bork, a Ronald Reagan nominee, in 1987, Reid's first year in the Senate. Democrats launched a massive public assault on Bork’s conservative judicial philosophy and record. Bork did face a hearing and a Senate vote, which he lost, but his confirmation process made the rules of the game more contentious. "The rules have been changed for the battle over this particular seat on the court," an internal Reagan administration memo read, according to Roll Call. "Maybe they have been changed for all time. We must convince the nomination handlers that the opposition has invented the tank, and we have to get out of the trenches and take the offensive." More recently, several Senate Democrats — including Reid and then-Sen. Obama — attempted a filibuster against conservative Bush nominee Samuel Alito. The filibuster, though, was largely symbolic, as not enough senators participated to actually delay or block the vote, which resulted in Alito’s confirmation. Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson said comparing Democratic opposition to Republican nominees with the current Republican tactics amounted to a false equivalence. Referring to the Alito filibuster, Jentleson said, "No lay person could possibly consider this to be on the same planet as what Republicans are doing to Garland." In his interview with Reid, Todd mentioned Democratic opposition to Bush nominee Miguel Estrada, who was up for a position on the federal appeals court for the D.C. Circuit. In 2005, Senate Democrats garnered enough votes to block Estrada's confirmation. Because Estrada was up for a federal appeals judge position, not one on the Supreme Court, this incident doesn't affect this fact-check. Before we rule, we wanted to note a slight error in the second part of Reid’s statement that "since 1900 in a lame-duck session, there have been six (nominees) that have all been approved." We have found in a previous fact-check that since the early 1900s, there have been six Supreme Court nominees in election years, and all were confirmed. However, only one was clearly a "lame-duck" nominee, meaning the president making the nomination was no question on the way out (Reagan). The others were nominated by presidents running for re-election to serve another term (Herbert Hoover, William Howard Taft, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, who nominated two people in 1916). Our ruling Reid said Senate Democrats "have never held up a Supreme Court nomination." Reid steps a little too far in saying Democrats "have never held up" a nomination. They were chiefly responsible for Bork’s failed nomination, a turning point in the political nature of Supreme Court nominations, and they at least symbolically attempted to hold up Alito’s confirmation in 2005. However, we can't find a time when a Democratic Senate refused to hear a Republican president's nominee. Even if they were opposed, they allowed the nominee to come to a comfirmation vote.

Since taking office, Kasich has used the issue as a yardstick measuring Ohio's progress -- often on Fox News, where he once hosted his own show and remains a regular presence. In his most recent interview, on April 2 with anchor Neil Cavuto, the governor proclaimed his best news yet: "We were the No. 1 job creator in America in February, and we are now the No. 4 job creator in the last year." That followed a loss of 400,000 jobs over the previous four years, he said. When the governor speaks, PolitiFact Ohio listens -- and checks. In previous ratings, going back to the 2010 campaign, we found that the 400,000 number was correct -- but that it was inaccurate to put all the blame for Ohio's economic woes on Strickland. Last August, Kasich took credit for his administration creating an increase of 45,000 jobs since the beginning of the year. The number was accurate, but we rated that claim as Mostly False for the part of the statement where the governor said "we’ve created" the jobs. But the governor earned a rating of Mostly True in January when he said Ohio ranked 8th in the nation in job creation. Now we asked Kasich's spokesman, Rob Nichols, his basis for saying Ohio was number one in job creation in February and number four over the previous year. He pointed to employment data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and to the news release issued by the bureau when it posted new numbers on March 30 . "In February," says the BLS release, "nonfarm payroll employment increased in 42 states and the District of Columbia and decreased in 8 states. The largest over-the-month increase in employment occurred in Ohio (up 28,300), followed by Texas and New York." The Ohio figure was the nation's "largest statistically significant" job gain, BLS said. (In terms of percentage increase in employment, the second category used by BLS, North Dakota ranked first, up 1.3 percent. But raw numbers have been the metric used consistently by the Kasich administration and the Kasich campaign before that.) The BLS release also lists the states that had "statistically significant employment changes from February 2011 to February 2012." The biggest gainer was Texas, which added 273,900 jobs, followed by New York and California. No. 4, adding 73,500 jobs, was Ohio. So Kasich’s figures are accurate. And, putting them in context, he did not overreach when Cavuto asked if credit due to governor might be taken by President Obama. "When economies get better, executives get credit for it," Kasich said. "The fact is, does he benefit to some degree in Ohio from that? There`s no question that he does. Do I? Yes. Are we responsible for it? From our perspective out here, we have just taken on a lot of tough problems and created a better environment." That part could be classified as political rhetoric, and we’re not rating it. But Kasich’s statement about job creation rates is True.

pomt-13270	"If you look worldwide, the number of terrorist incidents have not substantially increased."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/13/barack-obama/obama-says-terrorism-worldwide-has-not-increased-s/	President Barack Obama spoke with veterans and active military members at a CNN town hall, discussing extended wait periods at VA hospitals and and the threat of terrorism. A major serving in the West Virginia Air National Guard asked Obama if the United States is doing anything greater to combat Islamic jihadists. He prefaced his question by saying that since Obama took office in 2009, "there has been a substantial increase in terror attacks around the world" and in the United States. Obama contradicted the premise of the question, though. "It's important to recognize that if you look worldwide, the number of terrorist incidents have not substantially increased," Obama said. "What we've seen are some very high-profile attacks, mostly in the Middle East, also in our European theaters." Obama said the emergence of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also called ISIS) underscored "that the ideology of hatred and killing had metastasized" even after the killing of Osama bin Laden and the dismantling of al-Qaida. He also said military efforts, intelligence work and other improvements had made large-scale terrorist attacks more difficult. Obama said there had not been a "substantial" increase in terrorism. Even though there’s no hard number to measure that against, we decided to look into it. Obama’s numbers, and a caveat When we asked, the White House referred us to data from the State Department’s counterterrorism bureau. Terrorism is defined as "premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents." Looking at Obama’s time in office, worldwide terror attacks increased about 7 percent, from 10,999 in 2009 to 11,774 attacks in 2015. That’s an increase, not a decrease, but in recent years the numbers have been declining. In 2015, the total number of terrorist attacks decreased by 13 percent compared with 2014. Deaths due to terrorist attacks also decreased in 2015 compared to 2014, by 14 percent, according to the State Department figures. "This was largely due to fewer attacks and deaths in Iraq, Pakistan, and Nigeria," the report said. "This represents the first decline in total terrorist attacks and deaths worldwide since 2012." It’s problematic, though, to compare years between 2009 and 2015, because in 2012 the State Department changed the way it collected data about terrorist attacks. In 2012, the State Department began using data from the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, or START, from the University of Maryland. While the old count and the new count used similar methods -- data from open source information such as TV reports, specialized journals and think tank studies -- they are not exactly the same. The State Department said that due to the collection change, the data is "not directly comparable." ‘Conservative filter’ Erin Miller, who manages START’s Global Terrorism Database, says the numbers it provides the department amount to "a conservative filter" on the broader definition used in START’s own database. Totals presented by the State Department don’t include attacks targeting people in combat. They also exclude incidents in which there are mixed reports or vagueness. START’s overall count of global terrorism attacks in 2015 is at least 3,000 more than the State Department’s 2015 figure, because it includes some combat deaths and less definitive incidents. By START’s measure, there was a 214 percent increase in terrorist attacks from 2009 to 2015. Joseph Young, an associate professor in the School of Public Affairs and School of International Service at American University, said it is tough to make claims about trends in terrorism since 2009. Obama’s statement is one possible interpretation of the data. There have been small increases and decreases in attacks over recent years, shifts in targeted locations, more suicide attacks and a small decline of other terror actions, Young said. "(Obama’s) statement is consistent with a range of outcomes," Young said. START and State Department data both show there were fewer attacks in 2015 than in 2014. More than 55 percent of all terrorist attacks in 2015 happened in five countries — Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and Nigeria, according to State Department data. The department also reported 382 terrorist attacks in Syria in 2015 (up from 232 in 2014), but says they are conservative estimates given limitations of media coverage in that country. On top of attacks and fatalities rising, terrorist arrests are also up, noted Max Abrahms, a political science assistant professor at Northeastern University. A December 2015 report from the Program on Extremism at George Washington University said 56 individuals were arrested in 2015 in the United States for ISIS-related activities, "the largest number of terrorism arrests in a single year since September 2001." Brent Smith, director of the Terrorism Research Center at the University of Arkansas, said there are attacks, like the one in San Bernardino, Calif., last year, where there were no arrests because the perpetrators were killed in the incident. Our ruling Obama said, "If you look worldwide, the number of terrorist incidents have not substantially increased." There is no universally accepted definition of a terrorist incident, so there is no universally accepted count. Based on State Department data, there’s been a 7 percent increase in terrorist attacks worldwide from 2009 to 2015. But the State Department’s criteria for what can be counted as a terrorist attack is stricter than that of other databases. According to START’s Global Terrorism Database, for instance, there was a 214 percent rise in terrorist attacks from 2009 to 2015, a substantial increase. Obama’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0174e372-7a3e-45be-b61e-724cad9e0ab5	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2016-10-13T16:43:53	2016-09-28	['None']
pomt-14415	"I opposed TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) and have always opposed TPP."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/10/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-i-always-opposed-tpp-trans-pacific-partne/	Trade has become a dividing line in the Republican Party. While traditionally the GOP has been a vocal supporter of reducing trade barriers between the United States and its trading partners, the cost of trade deals on American jobs has led to outright opposition to the largest treaty now on the table, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. CNN moderator Jake Tapper asked Texas Sen. Ted Cruz to explain why he shifted from supporting the TPP to opposing it in the March 10 debate in Miami. Cruz was quick to say that the question contained an error. "There are two different agreements," Cruz said. "There’s TPA (Trade Promotion Authority), and TPP. I opposed TPP, and have always opposed TPP, which is what you asked about." Cruz was talking about two separate pieces of legislation that are linked, but indeed are separate. Before we untangle them, we will assess Cruz’s statement that he has always opposed the TPP. In a June 2015 post on his campaign website, Cruz’s staff said that he was taking a wait-and-see approach to the TPP. "Sen. Cruz has not taken a position either in favor or against TPP," the statement said. "He will wait until the agreement is finalized and he has a chance to study it carefully to ensure that the agreement will open more markets to American-made products, create jobs, and grow our economy." When the treaty language was released in early November 2015, Cruz’s stance hardened. At an event in Iowa on Nov. 20, 2015, Cruz said he would not support it. "There are a number of Republicans on that (debate) stage who support TPP, who support (the Trade Promotion Authority)," Cruz said. "I voted against TPA, and I intend to vote against TPP." That statement again blends Trade Promotion Authority with the TPP, but the key point is that Cruz said he opposed the trade deal. A shifting stance on Trade Promotion Authority Trade Promotion Authority is legislation that allows the president to negotiate a trade treaty with only an up-or-down vote on the final package in the Senate. The TPA was a key precursor to passage of the TPP. Cruz initially voted in favor of the TPA bill in the Senate. In fact, in anticipation of that vote, Cruz joined with current House Speaker Paul Ryan to publicly urge Congress to vote in favor of fast-track authority. Of particular importance to this fact-check, the opening lines of the op-ed the two published in the Wall Street Journal spoke of the promise of trade and described the TPP, while not actually using the name of the treaty itself. "The United States is making headway on two historic trade agreements, one with 11 countries on the Pacific Rim and another with America’s friends in Europe," Cruz and Ryan wrote. "These two agreements alone would mean greater access to a billion customers for American manufacturers, farmers and ranchers." The op-ed urged passage of Trade Promotion Authority, but the linkage to the TPP was the starting point. Trade promotion passed in the Senate. Following the Senate vote, the bill went to the House where it was split into two separate votes: one on TPA and the other on Trade Adjustment Assistance, or TAA (a program that provides training support, career counseling, allowances and wage supplements to workers affected by globalization and trade). On June 12, fast-track passed, but Trade Adjustment Assistance was voted down. In a procedural vote on June 23, the Senate passed the fast-track legislation once again, 60-38. But this time Cruz cast a "nay" vote. Cruz explained that he had learned new details of the TPA that smacked of a backroom deal and he would have no part of it. Our ruling Cruz said he has always opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The record shows that he took no position on the treaty itself until the full text became public. Then he said he opposed it. However, when Cruz first supported granting the president the key authority to finalize the TPP, he spoke positively about the concept of the trade deal. He described how it could bring millions of customers to American business owners. When the treaty moved from being a concept to actual text, Cruz opposed it. His statement glosses over his initial backing of the idea of the trade treaty. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2016-03-10T22:50:50	2016-03-10	['None']
pomt-10928	Says "political interference" from Scott Walker’s administration has led to "gagging (DNR) scientists so they can no longer comment on proposed legislation" and "we’re letting polluters write their own permits."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jul/27/kelda-helen-roys/governor-hopeful-kelda-roys-says-walker-administra/	Republican Gov. Scott Walker has made headlines for years with his initiatives to ease regulatory burdens in the state after declaring during his Jan 3, 2011, inaugural address that "Wisconsin is open for business." But has the Walker administration gone so far as to prevent Department of Natural Resources scientists from commenting on proposed legislation, and letting corporations draft their own permits? That was the claim from former state Rep. Kelda Roys, one of eight Democrats hoping to face Walker in the November 2018 election. In a May 2, 2018, interview with journalist Steve Walters of WisconsinEye, Roys claimed "political interference" from Walker’s administration has led to "gagging (DNR) scientists so they can no longer comment on proposed legislation." And, "We're letting polluters write their own permits." Let’s take a look at both parts of Roys’ claim. The changing role of DNR in legislation When asked for backup on the "gagging" part of the claim, the Roys campaign provided three news articles. Two (Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and Isthmus) reported a case in which DNR testimony was absent from a legislative hearing regarding chronic wasting disease and the baiting/feeding of white-tailed deer. The other, from Scientific American, carried this headline: "How Scott Walker dismantled Wisconsin's environmental legacy." In the March 23, 2017, Isthmus article, DNR Deputy Secretary Kurt Thiede is quoted as saying: "The department does not take positions for or against legislation. When requested, the department appears at the public hearing for informational purposes when requested by either a committee chairman or a bill’s primary author. This has been administration policy since 2011." When asked to comment, the Walker campaign referred us to the Republican Party of Wisconsin, which cited numerous instances where the department was asked to testify -- for information only -- at legislative hearings during Walker’s administration: Assembly Bills 160, 203, and 668, and Senate Bills 228 and 368 among them. DNR communications director Jim Dick said since February 15, 2017, DNR staff have given informational testimony on 30 different topics during legislative hearings, met with legislators and/or their staff about once a week, and have fielded about 40 calls or emails a week to answer questions from lawmakers on various topics. "In a three-year period (2014-2017)," said Dick, "we received and responded to more than 6,000 legislative inquiries. DNR staff does communicate with legislators and legislative staff frequently. But it is not our role to offer our opinion on whether a particular piece of legislation is right or wrong, good or bad." Still, the policy marks a change from the pre-Walker era. Tom Hauge, who retired in 2016 after serving 25 years as wildlife director for the department, said staffers had more latitude in the past. At any and every relevant hearing, he said, experts from the department would testify alongside the department’s legislative liaison, taking a stand on whether the agency supported, opposed, or was neutral toward the proposed legislation. If they found that the legislation would have negative impact — "I don’t just mean trivial," he added — they would take an official position in opposition at the hearings. Shifting DNR’s role to an invite-only, information-only basis hasn’t necessarily reduced its participation in legislative hearings, as the earlier numbers show. But there’s no guarantee that they will be asked to attend. For instance, the DNR was noticeably uninvited to the March 2017 hearing on Assembly Bill 61 which would lighten rules that prohibit baiting/feeding deer in counties with documented chronic wasting disease. Hauge, then retired, attended as a private citizen; reports said he fielded questions from interested lawmakers for nearly half an hour after giving his testimony. So, DNR staffers have not been "gagged," in that they continue to testify at hearings and provide information to lawmakers. But under Walker administration policy they cannot go beyond "providing information" in their statements and can’t even do that unless explicitly invited. The role of permitted entities in their own permitting On the issue of "polluters writing their own permits," the Roys campaign sent two Wisconsin State Journal articles, but only one was on point. And in that article, the DNR explicitly denied accusations that "polluters" (in this case, dairy producers) will be allowed to write their own permits under Walker-administration initiatives aimed at moving the burden of permit-related paperwork to credentialed contractors. After our own digging, we found that desires to "streamline" permitting were among many changes included in DNR’s "strategic alignment plan," which was announced in November 2016 by then-DNR secretary Cathy Stepp. A Nov 30, 2016, article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel covered the announcement, saying: "The DNR will develop a program to turn over some time-consuming tasks of permit writing to experts in the private sector who are hired by a property owner or business seeking the permit. The agency plans to set benchmarks so that officials reviewing the permits can be assured that information they get from the consultants is accurate." The article also said: "The DNR will still write final permits, but will develop so-called ‘assurance programs’ so they can rely more on the accuracy of information provided by private parties. The new approach on permits is part of a series of organizational changes officials say will make the agency more efficient at a time when its workforce has shrunk to a 30-year low." Did these plans become a reality? Changes to wetland permits were the first major change under Walker, with the introduction of the "assured delineator" program. This initiative encourages project planners to hire consultants to mark wetlands for which construction would be prohibited or require mitigation, prior to applying for a permit. Dick, the department spokesman, told us the DNR announced plans in 2016 for similar "assurance programs" that would allow large dairy producers to hire private contractors to work on their pollution permit applications. But, he noted, the program hasn’t been implemented yet. And the DNR is now in discussions about moving the entire program to the Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection, so "the plan is not likely to be implemented anytime soon, if at all." Sarah Geers, staff attorney for Midwest Environmental Advocates, works to watchdog DNR’s implementation and enforcement of environmental laws. Her take on permitting matched Dick’s. So, various changes were proposed that would have allowed permit applicants to hire contractors to complete major parts of the permit applications. But saying the plan allows polluters to write their own permits goes too far -- especially since the programs have not been implemented. Our rating Roys said "political interference" from Scott Walker’s administration has led to "gagging (DNR) scientists so they can no longer comment on proposed legislation" and "we’re letting polluters write their own permits." As for the Walker administration, DNR scientists are permitted to share their expertise regarding proposed legislation -- without declaring a position or commenting on the legislation itself -- by invitation only. The evidence suggests this still happens frequently, though pre-Walker staffers had more latitude in what they could say. As for the second half of Roys’ statement, Walker has taken steps to change permit-writing processes so that businesses are more involved (and DNR officials less involved). But the plans have not come to fruition, and even if they did, responsibility would shift to "assured contractors" and would not occur in-house with those Roys labeled the "polluters." On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Kelda Helen Roys	None	None	None	2018-07-27T06:00:00	2018-05-02	['None']
pomt-10262	As a state senator in Illinois, Obama made sure women got equal pay for equal work.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/26/michelle-obama/obama-was-there-for-equal-pay-but-not-alone/	The Obama campaign continues trying to bolster its case among female voters, trying to show his record on women's issues. The candidate's wife took up the task during her convention speech, lauding Barack Obama's work in the Illinois state Senate, where she said he was busy "moving people from welfare to jobs, passing tax cuts for hard-working families, and making sure women get equal pay for equal work." We looked into the welfare to work claim here, and we examined the tax cut claim here. In this story, we're looking at the final element in Michelle Obama's three-point claim, that what her husband did in the state legislature included "making sure women get equal pay for equal work." In 2003, the Illinois General Assembly passed a law that gave workers more protection from gender-based pay discrimination than federal law provides. The Illinois law applies to employers with four or more employees, instead of the 15-worker threshold in federal law, allowing more workers to file complaints. Obama was not the lead sponsor of the bill in the state Senate, but he did co-sponsor it on the day it was introduced. The lead sponsor, Carol Ronen, said Obama was "instrumental" and played a "significant role" in crafting the bill. Ronen, who has also left the state Senate, is a Democratic superdelegate. The bill passed the Senate easily, on a 53-2 vote, with one member voting present. Obama attended the Mother's Day bill signing with his daughters, said Melissa Josephs, who was also there. Josephs is director of equal opportunity policy at Women Employed, a Chicago-based not-for-profit group that supported the bill. The bill gave equal-pay protection to an estimated 330,000 additional workers, including some state employees that were not covered under federal law, Josephs said. Since it became law, the state has investigated more than 300 cases, and workers have received more than $91,000 in back pay. Let's come back to Michelle Obama's statement. Did Barack Obama make sure women get equal pay for equal work? Well, sort of. It's always difficult to judge the contribution of any single lawmaker in passage of an individual piece of legislation, and we recognize that the person best situated to answer that question here is currently supporting Obama's presidential campaign. Still, there are enough details to reach a reasonable conclusion. Obama was an early co-sponsor of the legislation, and his appearance for the bill signing supports the contention that he considered it a priority. Obama helped pass a law that expanded equal-pay protections, though that doesn't necessarily guarantee equal pay. Although he wasn't the architect of the policy, he was more than a bit player. Michelle Obama's statement is Mostly True.	None	Michelle Obama	None	None	None	2008-08-26T00:00:00	2008-08-25	['Illinois', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-00532	"This March, for the first time in human history, the monthly average carbon dioxide in our atmosphere exceeded 400 parts per million. The range had been 170-300 parts per million for hundreds of thousands of years."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2015/jun/21/sheldon-whitehouse/sen-whitehouse-gets-it-right-co2-air-historic-leve/	Sheldon Whitehouse gave his 100th speech on climate change on the floor of the U.S. Senate on May 18, 2015. Over the past three years, the senator has served up several climate claims worth checking during his running series "Time to wake up." So we examined his 100th installment and noticed this statement: "This March, for the first time in human history, the monthly average carbon dioxide in our atmosphere exceeded 400 parts per million. The range had been 170-300 parts per million for hundreds of thousands of years." Scientists, who see climate change as Whitehouse does, say the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the earth’s atmosphere is increasing due, in large part, to the burning of fossil fuels. And they say rising CO2 levels are an indicator that humans are degrading the health of the planet. We went looking for evidence and quickly found a report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that seemed right on target. On May 6, NOAA announced that the monthly global average of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere had exceeded 400 parts per million — for the first time since it had been compiling the data in 1979. This seemed to leave only the "human history" part of Whitehouse’s claim in question. But when Whitehouse addressed the issue May 18, he did not specify his source. And, confusingly, he spoke of a "monthly average" not a "monthly global average," the term used by NOAA. The distinction is relevant: While the NOAA monthly global average had never exceeded 400 over a period of more than 35 years, the agency’s scientists had previously measured monthly average carbon dioxide levels exceeding 400 ppm in several single locations. In 2012, for example, the "monthly average" at the NOAA observatory in Barrow, Alaska, exceeded 400 ppm for the first time. Then the agency’s observatory in Mauna Loa, Hawaii, reported that its "monthly average" CO2 level had exceeded 400 parts per million in April 2014. These earlier records, which were reported extensively, were based on observations from single locations while the NOAA monthly global average is based on data from 40 different sites. So Whitehouse seems to have been off a bit with his description of the monthly CO2 data. But what about human history? The senator’s spokesman, Seth Larson, referred us to ice-core data from Antarctica. Scientists take core samples in Greenland and Antarctica and study the CO2 level of air bubbles — some of which have been trapped in the ice for hundreds of thousands of years. Data from Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, which serves as the primary climate-change data hub of the U.S Department of Energy, show carbon dioxide concentrations ranging between 170 and 300 parts per million "over the last 800,000 years." That more than covers Whitehouse’s in-human-history claim as humans have only been around for about 200,000, according to the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History. Before we closed the book on this one, we contacted Anthony Watts, an often-quoted global-warming skeptic. Watts claimed Whitehouse was wrong and cited the individual monthly data and a 2005 article in Nature that he said challenged the senator’s statement. We tracked down the lead author of the Nature, Swedish scientist Anders Moberg, and asked him about the Watts challenge. Impossible, Moberg said, explaining that his study was about temperatures in 1100 AD to 1150 AD — not carbon dioxide. For CO2 data, Moberg and John King, an oceanography professor at URI, pointed us to the ice-core research, the same data cited by Whitehouse’s office. The ice core records "would support the Senator's statement," said King. "The highest natural levels are around 300 ppm." Our ruling In his 100th speech on global warming on May 18, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said: "This March, for the first time in human history, the monthly average carbon dioxide in our atmosphere exceeded 400 parts per million. The range had been 170-300 parts per million for hundreds of thousands of years." He probably could have been more precise if he had used the phrase "global average," because there have been times when the monthly average exceed 400 parts per million at observation sites in Alaska and Hawaii. Beyond that small point, Whitehouse and his staff were on solid ground. For that reason, we rate his statement True.

pomt-14295	Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland "voted to uphold" D.C.’s ban on handguns.	false	/virginia/statements/2016/apr/04/john-whitbeck/john-whitbeck-misfires-merrick-garlands-gun-record/	Gun rights are "hanging by a thread," Republican Party of Virginia chairman John Whitbeck wrote recently in an email urging the rejection of U.S. Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland. "When Justice Antonin Scalia wrote his watershed opinion in D.C. v. Heller, it marked the first time that an individual right to keep and bear arms was recognized by the Supreme Court by a razor thin 5-4 vote," Whitbeck wrote. "Now President (Barack) Obama is attempting to replace Justice Scalia with Judge Merrick Garland, an avowed opponent of our Second Amendment rights. While Justice Scalia voted to overturn D.C.’s draconian gun laws, Judge Garland voted to uphold them," the chairman added, emphasizing the second sentence with bold type. Whitbeck concluded his email by asking Republicans to sign an Internet petition telling Virginia’s U.S. senators - Democrats Mark Warner and Tim Kaine - that Merrick "must not be confirmed to the Supreme Court!" Scalia, who died Feb. 13, did write the majority opinion in the Supreme Court’s landmark 2008 ruling on District of Columbia vs. Heller. By a 5-4 vote, the high court found that Washington’s gun regulations - essentially amounting to a ban on handguns in the home - were unconstitutional. This Truth-O-Meter will focus on Whitbeck’s claim that Garland, who has been a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit since 1997, "voted to uphold" the handgun ban. A number of conservative organizations and individuals, including Fox News commentator Bill O’Reilly, have made similar statements. The D.C. law The Supreme Court’s decision in Heller was significant because it was the first time justices ruled that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual’s right to own a firearm for self-defense. Until Heller, the widespread understanding was that the right to bear arms did not necessarily extend beyond militia service. Before the case went to the Supreme Court, though, it was heard in the federal appeals court where Garland serves. In a 2-1 decision, a panel of D.C. appeals judges came to the same conclusion as the Supreme Court: The Washington handgun ban was unconstitutional. Based on Whitbeck’s claim, one might assume that the single dissenting vote in this D.C. Circuit opinion belonged to Garland. However, it was Judge Karen Henderson who dissented, while Judges Laurence Silberman and Thomas Griffith signed the majority opinion. Garland didn’t vote on the case at all. He was not part of the three-judge panel that heard it. After the D.C. Circuit handed down its 2007 decision, the city of Washington asked the court to rehear the case en banc, meaning all of the court’s judges would reconsider the case and not just the three-judge panel. The court ended up denying the city’s petition, but Garland was among the group of D.C. Circuit judges who voted to rehear the case. It’s misleading to say Garland supported the Washington gun regulations because he wanted to reconsider Heller, as he did not take a formal position on the merits of the case. Rehearing a case en banc is generally used when a case goes against precedent or presents a question of significant importance, and that was true of the Heller case. D.C. Circuit Judge A. Raymond Randolph, a well-known conservative, joined Garland in voting to reconsider the case. And the George W. Bush administration, though supportive of the notion that the Second Amendment protects individual gun rights, filed an amicus brief asking the Supreme Court to send Heller back to the lower court for broader definition - for example, what type of gun-ownership restrictions should remain constitutional. "Garland voted for his court to consider the constitutionality of D.C.'s law," Adam Winkler, a Second Amendment law expert at the University of California Los Angeles Law School, recently told PolitiFact National when it was fact-checking a statement by O’Reilly. "Such a vote does not tell us one way or another how Garland feels about the Second Amendment." Our ruling Whitbeck said Garland "voted to uphold" D.C.’s ban on handguns. Garland never heard the case about Washington’s gun law from the bench. It was ruled unconstitutional by a panel of three other judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where Garland serves. Garland voted in favor of having the full court reconsider the case en banc - not an unusual step when a major decision bucks precedent. Randolph, a conservative judge on the appeals court who didn’t sit on the three-member panel, also voted to have the decision reconsidered en banc. It’s simply inaccurate to say Garland’s vote to reconsider the case is tantamount to a vote to uphold D.C.’s gun restriction or to extrapolate from it the nominee’s position on the case. So we rate Whitbeck’s claim False.	None	John Whitbeck	None	None	None	2016-04-04T11:48:30	2016-03-28	['Merrick_B._Garland', 'Washington,_D.C.']
pomt-02819	"American voters remain steadfast in their support for immigration reform with a path to citizenship, with more than 70 percent who want to see reform passed this year."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2013/nov/25/causa-oregon/do-more-70-percent-american-voters-support-pathway/	Few issues are more likely to ignite roaring political arguments these days than immigration. Finding common ground on this hot-button topic isn’t easy, as witnessed now in Washington, D.C., where Congress could adjourn for the year without reaching agreement on immigration reform that members of both parties insist is critical. But while some say the real focus should be on increased border security and not rewarding those who enter the country illegally, others counter that guest-worker programs and the needs of the estimated 11 million people living in the U.S. illegally should be paramount. In this atmosphere of division, a recent claim by Andrea Miller, executive director of Causa Oregon, caught our attention. In a Nov. 14, 2013, news release criticizing House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, for his refusal to take up an immigration bill passed by the Senate, she said, "American voters remain steadfast in their support for immigration reform with a path to citizenship, with more than 70 percent who want to see reform passed this year." Given the controversy hanging over every aspect of immigration, are more than seven in 10 Americans really in favor of reforms that include providing "a path to citizenship?" PolitiFact Oregon decided to check. We emailed Causa Oregon, a Salem-based immigration rights organization, and asked where it got the 70 percent figure. Erik Sorenson, the group’s communications director, said that "several polls" contain that finding. He specifically mentioned a recent Gallup poll. We checked and found some information supporting Miller’s assertion. In a Gallup poll conducted in June 2012, for instance, 66 percent of respondents said immigration is "a good thing" for the country. That was up up from 59 percent last year and one percentage point off the high of 67 percent in 2006, according to the poll. The response was even more favorable in a Gallup poll conducted in June. Fully 87 percent of respondents said they favored allowing "illegal immigrants living in the U.S. the opportunity to become citizens after a long waiting period if they paid taxes and a penalty, pass a criminal background check, and learn English." As Sorenson indicated, a number of other polls around the country have revealed strong support when respondents were asked if they support reform that would allow immigrants living in the U.S. illegally to remain here legally and, further, to apply for citizenship. An Associated Press GfK poll conducted in January, for instance, found that more than six in 10 Americans favored allowing illegal immigrants to eventually become U.S. citizens. A CBS News poll last month showed 77 percent of respondents willing to embrace that option. Miller’s claim was looking plausible but we called the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington, D.C., to get another perspective. Steven A. Camarota, the nonpartisan group’s research director, said, in essence, not so fast. "It all depends on what you ask," he said. "As with all polls, how you phrase the questions matters enormously." Camarota said he was familiar with the poll results Causa Oregon cited, but he passed along a couple of other recent polls that produced dramatically different results. The primary difference from one to another, he said, was the wording. An Ipsos poll conducted in February for Thompson Reuters, for instance, asked bluntly, "When you think about immigration, which of the following solutions comes closest to your opinion?" Only 5 percent of respondents answered yes to "All illegal immigrants should be able to stay in the U.S., with some exceptions." Another 31 percent said "most" should be able to remain here. However, a combined 53 percent said most or all illegal immigrants should be deported. Camarota said similar reversals in results came when pollsters subbed in the word "amnesty" for the phrase "pathway to citizenship." Yet another poll, conducted in August by NBC News/Esquire, asked respondents if they supported "providing illegal immigrants with a path to citizenship even though they have broken the rules." Only 16 percent answered yes. "If you remind people that illegal immigrants broke the rules," Camarota said, "they pull back quickly. It suggests the support may be tissue-paper thin." All of the polls we looked at, including those mentioned by Causa Oregon, were conducted by reputable, professional polling organizations and had error margins no greater than plus or minus three percentage points. The combined results of those polls, not unlike the controversy surrounding proposed immigration reform, were all over the map. So do seven in 10 Americans support letting illegal immigrants remain in the U.S. with an added bonus of a pathway to citizenship? Apparently so, according to several polls -- but only if you don’t remind respondents that someone "broke the rules" coming here in the first place. Adding that phrase, according to other polls, yielded a far different answer. We rate Causa Oregon’s claim Half True.	None	Causa Oregon	None	None	None	2013-11-25T15:58:04	2013-11-14	['United_States']
pomt-07326	Says Rick Perry "turned down our invitation to meet" President Barack Obama in El Paso.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/may/13/jay-carney/president-obamas-press-secretary-says-rick-perry-d/	Asked why President Barack Obama didn’t meet with Texas Gov. Rick Perry during his one-day trip to Texas, White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters Tuesday: "Gov. Perry turned down our invitation to meet the president at the airport." Obama spokesman Adam Abrams later told us that Carney was referring to the airport in El Paso, where Obama ventured before flying to Austin for political fundraisers. According to a White House transcript, when a reporter suggested Perry "wanted a more substantial meeting" and didn’t want to travel across the state "to discuss the wildfires and border security and all that," Carney replied: "Again, we invited him to meet with the president, and he declined the invitation." Did Perry refuse to greet Obama in El Paso? Rewind: In August, the GOP governor experienced a 34-second handshake of a conversation with the Democratic president at Austin’s airport during which he attempted to hand him a letter urging closer attention to security along the U.S.-Mexico border. The letter was accepted by a White House adviser. In an interview, Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed confirmed that on Tuesday, the governor declined an offer from the White House to greet the president in El Paso. "It would have been a 10-minute greeting," she said. However, Nashed said, "we did ask them if we could meet and greet the president later in Austin or if the president would be interested in" taking a flying tour of wildfires that have hurt rural Texas. "Unfortunately, we couldn’t arrange anything," Nashed said. Separately, Perry spokesman Mark Miner was quoted in the Austin American-Statesman’s Postcards blog as saying Perry "wanted to meet with the president to discuss the wildfires and border security, not just shake his hand in a receiving line on a tarmac." We asked how the governor passed the hours he could have spent journeying to and from El Paso, about 575 miles from Austin. Nashed, forwarding Perry's state schedule for that day, said he joined Jay Kimbrough, his former chief of staff and a favorite troubleshooter, in marking the anniversary of the severe wound Kimbrough endured as a Marine machine gunner in Vietnam in 1967. The two lunched in East Texas, she said, and joined a motorcycle ride to a veterans museum in Huntsville. On May 12, as noted by the Dallas Morning News, Perry told interviewer Laura Ingraham that he didn't have time to fly to El Paso for a handshake. The newspaper said Perry told Ingraham, "If he wanted to meet, I was in Austin. I would have been here." The White House did not comment on Perry’s professed offer to meet in Austin, though emails between Perry's office and the White House confirm that Perry was invited to greet the president in El Paso and that a gubernatorial aide asked if it was "an option" for Perry to greet Obama in Austin "since we are here." A White House aide replied: "Unfortunately there won't be a tarmac greet in Austin." PolitiFact Texas obtained the emails through an open-records request. Our call? Perry declined to howdy the president in El Paso. However, Carney’s response implies Perry flat refused to meet when an alternative meeting prospect was floated.

pomt-11812	BREAKING: Rosa Parks’ Granddaughter SLAMS Racist Democrats, Endorses Trump	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/nov/15/reaganwasright/no-rosa-parks-granddaughter-didnt-praise-trump/	A fake news story says that the granddaughter of civil rights icon Rosa Parks praised President Donald Trump following racial unrest. "Rosa Parks’ Granddaughter SLAMS racist Democrats, Endorses Trump," states the Nov. 4 headline on the website Reaganwasright. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The article states that Parks’ granddaughter defended Trump to denounce claims from "Antifa" protesters that Trump is a "racist bigot" and a "traitor." The article quoted Parks’ supposed granddaughter, Muriel Parks-Gouldman, speaking to students at Oxford University: "This violence and destruction I see from my people is just unacceptable. My grandmother took a stand by sitting down, but she would never ‘sit down’ while our once-proud people cover their faces and commit violent acts in the streets." But the story is fake because Rosa Parks was childless when she died in 2005 at age 92. The photo in the story is of Ohio state lawmaker Nina Turner. Rosa Parks is a famous African-American civil rights icon who in 1955 refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white man in Montgomery, Ala. The goal of the story appears to be to shock readers that a grandchild of Parks would side with Trump, who called the violence in Charlottesville a result of "hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides." In August, we fact-checked a similar claim that "Rosa Parks’ daughter praises (President Donald) Trump’s response to Charlottesville." In that article, Parks’ daughter had a similar name: Muriel Parks-Rosenberg. We messaged the website on Facebook and received a reply directing us to scroll to the bottom of the page. The disclaimer states: "Nothing on this site is real. It is satire. Call it "fan fiction" if you prefer." The headline says, "Rosa Parks’ granddaughter SLAMS racist Democrats, endorses Trump." But Parks didn’t have children. For viewers who scroll to the bottom of the page, they will find a disclaimer that describes the website as satire. We rate this headline Pants on Fire!

pomt-11006	Says Brett Kavanaugh "has said the president shouldn't be investigated."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/10/charles-schumer/trumps-supreme-court-pick-said-presidents-shouldnt/	Democrats pounced on a years-old statement by president Donald Trump’s U.S. Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh to drum up concern about how he might shield the president from Robert Mueller’s investigation. In an interview July 10, Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer suggested the comment about presidential power by Kavanaugh could give Trump a pass in the investigation, even though it came long before Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. "You are worried about president Trump’s overreach. So am I," Schumer said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. "This nominee has stood more, both certainly before he became a judge, for presidential overreach. He has said the president shouldn't be investigated. He has gone so far as to say a president if he declares a law unconstitutional doesn’t have to obey it. How is he going to react if Mueller needs a subpoena? If Mueller needs some other action?" Many Democrats have latched onto Kavanaugh’s statement about investigations into presidents. But we found that Democrats aren’t telling the full story about what Kavanaugh said. Minnesota Law Review article The statement by Kavanaugh stems from his 2009 article in the Minnesota Law Review about the separation of powers. At the time, he was a judge for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. His article was adapted from remarks he made at the University of Minnesota Law School on Oct. 17, 2008, a couple of weeks before the presidential election. Kavanaugh made a reference to his experience with the Starr Report, which said that president Bill Clinton lied under oath in Clinton vs. Jones regarding his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, obstructed justice, and refused to testify. Clinton was impeached in 1998 but acquitted by the Senate. In the law review article, Kavanaugh wrote that Congress could consider a law exempting the president while in office from criminal prosecution because it is "inevitably politicized by both their supporters and critics." Kavanaugh wrote that the Supreme Court‘s decision in Clinton vs Jones that presidents are not constitutionally entitled to deferral of civil suits "may well have been entirely correct" but Congress "may be wise" to set a statute to allow temporary deferral. Democrats have zeroed in on this passage by Kavanaugh: "Even the lesser burdens of a criminal investigation — including preparing for questioning by criminal investigators — are time-consuming and distracting. Like civil suits, criminal investigations take the president’s focus away from his or her responsibilities to the people. And a president who is concerned about an ongoing criminal investigation is almost inevitably going to do a worse job as president." Kavanaugh also wrote that the Constitution already provides a check on executive power, because an impeached president is then subject to criminal prosecution. "In short, the Constitution establishes a clear mechanism to deter executive malfeasance; we should not burden a sitting president with civil suits, criminal investigations, or criminal prosecutions. The president’s job is difficult enough as is. And the country loses when the president’s focus is distracted by the burdens of civil litigation or criminal investigation and possible prosecution." In a footnote, Kavanaugh wrote that the independent counsel statute, which was used by Kenneth Starr to investigate Clinton, "was a major mistake." "The law itself created a perverse structure that was inconsistent with foundational principles of separation of powers and that created problems for both the president and the independent counsel," he wrote. Experts weigh in on Schumer’s statement Law professors told us it was important to put Kavanaugh’s 2009 comments in context. Kavanaugh was calling for Congress to pass a statute granting presidents temporary immunity. "Schumer is using that notion — that in general, it is bad policy to allow presidents to be pursued by prosecutors while in office — to imply that Kavanaugh thinks Trump shouldn’t be investigated, and to question how he would rule as a judge," said Michigan State University law professor Brian Kalt. "That is disingenuous, because Kavanaugh was calling for Congress to pass a statute granting immunity. They have passed no such statute, and it is not reasonable to suggest that Kavanaugh as a judge would ignore that fact." If Kavanaugh became a justice and had to react to a future Mueller subpoena of Trump, Kavanaugh "would almost certainly respect the unanimous precedent of U.S. v. Nixon, which held that the president is not immune from subpoenas. If Congress passed a statute exempting the president from such subpoenas — which it hasn’t — then he would say that the president is exempt," Kalt said. Noah Feldman, a Harvard law professor, wrote in a Bloomberg column that while Democrats argue that Kavanaugh believes a president shouldn’t be indicted while in office, "Kavanaugh’s expressed views actually support the opposite conclusion: that the president can be investigated and maybe even indicted unless Congress passes a law saying he can’t — which Congress has not done." Kavanaugh said only that Congress should pass a law that delays certain investigations until after the presidency, Feldman told PolitiFact. "He did NOT say that was the state of affairs without the law — and there is no such law. For comparison, that is what Bill Clinton wanted even for civil investigation. Totally mainstream," Feldman said. "On the subpoena, we don’t know. But given that there is no law in place protecting (the president) and that Ken Starr issued subpoenas while Kavanaugh was working for him, my money would be on requiring Trump to comply." Our ruling Schumer said that Kavanaugh "has said the president shouldn't be investigated." Schumer is plucking one part of what Kavanaugh wrote in a 2009 Minnesota law review paper without recapping his comments in full. Kavanaugh wrote that civil suits and criminal investigations take away from a president’s focus on his or her work responsibilities. He didn’t call for the court to take away the power to investigate the president; he said that Congress could consider writing a law to exempt the president. As for Schumer’s concern for the Mueller investigation, experts said there is unanimous Supreme Court precedent that the president is not immune from subpoenas, and Kavanaugh has not indicated so far that he would change that.

pomt-06323	Solar and wind energy are "both cheaper than nuclear right now."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/11/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-says-wind-solar-are-already-cheaper-n/	During a Nov. 8, 2011, appearance on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, former President Bill Clinton touted the prospects for adopting renewable energy. "Solar energy and wind energy ... would already be competitive with coal if you had to pay the extraneous costs of coal -- the health care costs and other things. And ... wind within two years and solar within five will be competitive in price with coal. They're both cheaper than nuclear right now." A reader asked us to check Clinton’s comment. We won’t rate his claim that wind and solar will be competitive with coal within two and five years respectively, since that’s a prediction. Instead, we’ll focus on his claim that solar and wind energy are "both cheaper than nuclear right now." We found a price comparison published in 2011 by the Energy Information Administration, which is part of the U.S. Department of Energy. It uses "levelized cost" to compare various energy technologies. This measurement, widely used by energy policy analysts, includes the inflation-adjusted price tag for building and operating a plant over its life cycle. Here’s the summary table from this study, with the relevant technologies in bold. (One factor that was not included in this calculation was state or federal incentives, such as tax credits.) Method Total system levelized cost for plants entering service in 2016, in 2009 dollars per MWh Conventional Coal 94.8 Advanced Coal 109.4 Advanced Coal with carbon control and sequestration 136.2 Natural Gas-fired: Conventional Combined Cycle 66.1 Natural Gas-fired: Advanced Combined Cycle 63.1 Natural Gas-fired: Advanced Combined Cycle with carbon control and sequestration 89.3 Natural Gas-fired: Conventional Combustion Turbine 124.5 Natural Gas-fired: Advanced Combustion Turbine 103.5 Advanced Nuclear 113.9 Wind -- Onshore 97.0 Wind – Offshore 243.2 Solar -- Photovoltaic 210.7 Solar -- Thermal 311.8 Geothermal 101.7 Biomass 112.5 Hydropower 86.4 So, according to this study, the least expensive form of wind energy -- using onshore turbines -- is about 15 percent cheaper than nuclear. But the cheapest form of solar -- using photovoltaic panels -- is about 85 percent more expensive than nuclear. This means that Clinton’s claim was half-right. (Clinton also could have pointed to three additional forms of renewable energy that are cheaper than nuclear -- geothermal, biomass and hydropower.) The experts we contacted generally agreed with this analysis. "It’s common and convenient to couple solar and wind in offhand references, but solar-based electricity remains, for now, appreciably costlier than wind," said Joel Darmstadter, a senior fellow with Resources for the Future, a Washington-based think tank on energy and environmental issues. He cautioned that not including government incentives does add to the uncertainty of these figures, though it potentially cuts both ways. For instance, nuclear plants benefit from the Price-Anderson Act, which limits their accident liability, while solar and wind receive different types of tax credits, he said. Stephen Brown, an economist at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas who specializes in energy policy, agreed that Clinton was right on wind but not on solar. He added that if you include additional factors known as externalities -- the kinds of things Clinton was referring to in the first part of his quote, such as the spillover environmental costs of the technology in question -- then the cost comparison could change. For instance, if the externalities were found to be sufficiently low for solar and sufficiently high for nuclear, he said, solar might end up being cheaper than nuclear. However, since Clinton wasn’t making that comparison, we won’t factor that possibility into our rating. A final thought from Darmstadter: In the short term, the comparative price options make natural gas, not any of the renewable fuels, the lowest-cost competitor with coal. Several natural gas technologies are cheaper than coal, according to the Energy Department study. Our ruling Clinton was correct about wind energy being "cheaper than nuclear right now," at least the onshore kind. But for now, nuclear beats the cheapest form of solar energy on price. So we rate his statement Half True.	None	Bill Clinton	None	None	None	2011-11-11T15:13:01	2011-11-08	['None']
pomt-12587	"Since 2012," city of Austin "property taxes have gone up almost 30 percent while incomes have only risen 4 percent."	false	/texas/statements/2017/apr/07/ellen-troxclair/ellen-troxclair-incorrectly-city-taxes-incomes-fam/	An Austin City Council member declared that city property taxes have lately surged with family incomes failing to keep up. Ellen Troxclair, who represents District 8 in Southwest Austin, told Lauren Petrowski of Austin’s Fox 7 on a February 2017 edition of "Good Day Austin" that she wants the city this year to "move the needle" versus the local cost of living. In the interview, Troxclair touted her affordability action plan, which was set aside by the council a week later. Troxclair: "Since 2012, property taxes have gone up almost 30 percent—" Petrowski: "Wow." Troxclair: "—while incomes have only risen 4 percent. So people are really struggling to stay in the city." Let’s gauge the proclaimed tax changes, then the described changes in income. City taxes up? By email, Troxclair aide Alice Claiborne said the nearly 30 percent statistic was derived by comparing the city property tax bill on a median-valued non-senior homestead as reported in the city budget for 2016-17 with the bill on a median-valued residence as stated in the city’s 2011-12 budget. The budget for fiscal 2011-12, which began in October 2011, states: "The median property tax bill is estimated at $879 per year" on a median-priced residence. The 2016-17 city budget estimated the city property tax bill on that year’s median-valued non-senior homestead at $1,132.96--which was 29 percent greater than the noted 2011-12 figure. Yet, we noticed, that comparison looked at different classifications of property. Single-family residences sweep in stand-alone homes, townhouses, condominiums, row houses and mobile homes regardless of who lives there. "Homestead" refers to an owner-occupied residence that can qualify for tax breaks. In 2016, according to the Travis Central Appraisal District, Austin had 183,423 single-family residences; 130,253 Austin property owners claimed a homestead exemption. By email, a city budget official, Ed Van Eenoo, advised that at the council's direction, the estimated tax bill in the 2016-17 budget was limited to non-senior homesteads, meaning those properties affected by increased exemptions adopted by the council. He confirmed that was a change from the 2011-12 budget. To reach a balanced comparison, we asked for the appropriate 2011-12 figure to compare with the 2016-17 tax estimate. Van Eenoo replied that the city tax tab for the median-value non-senior homestead in 2011-12 was $967.02. The 2016-17 tax bill for that type of homestead was 17 percent--not 29 percent--greater. Homestead tax changes Even so, we realized, that percentage doesn’t reflect actual changes in city-levied taxes for any given property. For starters, increases in the median-valued homestead were influenced by new and more valuable homes landing on the tax roll. Beyond that factor, we wondered how much more actual homeowners faced in 2016-17 city taxes compared with what the homeowners paid in 2011-12. To gauge that, we turned to Marya Crigler, chief appraiser for the appraisal district, which appraises local properties for taxation purposes. We asked Crigler to focus on city taxes on specific homesteads occupied by the same owner or owners in the period so we could see how each homeowner fared by 2016. Crigler emailed us tax data for eight geographically dispersed Austin homesteads whose owners in 2011-12 had paid city taxes of $967, which was then the bill for the city’s median non-senior homestead. Results: Seven sampled properties faced higher taxes in 2016 than 2011 or 2012, but the differences varied widely, from 3 percent to 24 percent—and one homestead, in East Austin east of U.S. 183, faced 4 percent less in taxes for 2016 than 2012. On average, the taxes levied in 2016 were 11 percent higher than the taxes levied in 2011 and 8 percent up from 2012. Location mattered. Among the homesteads, the smallest tax differences showed up on suburban properties, the biggest on urban-core homesteads in East Austin and west of MoPac Boulevard, the spreadsheet shows. Crigler also emailed us a chart showing that by TCAD’s calculations, the $1,137 in city taxes due on a median-value homestead in 2016 was $124 or 12 percent greater than the $1,013 due on a median-value homestead in 2012. Significantly, Crigler said, the 2016 figures take into account the curbing effect on tax bills from state homestead appraised-value limits plus the local homestead tax exemptions approved by the council that year. So, Austin’s homestead property taxes were almost universally higher in 2016 than five years previous. But for the most part, homeowners weren’t socked as hard as Troxclair's "almost 30 percent" suggests. Van Eenoo, when we asked, had no quibble with Crigler’s figures. Michael Searle, Troxclair’s chief of staff, questioned our focus on homesteads rather than single-family dwellings. "I would say that looking only at homesteads gives a narrow picture," Searle emailed. We tried to check on changes in taxes on median-value single-family dwellings. Van Eenoo said, though, the finance staff did not have a 2016 figure comparable to the 2011-12 budget’s figure. He said the council in 2016 directed it to focus on taxes on homesteads, enabling members to track the effect of the council-adopted increases in homestead tax exemptions. Family incomes Next, we turned to Troxclair’s claim about minimal changes in local incomes. Claiborne and Searle told us city staffers gave Troxclair the figures she relied on to gauge changes in Austin’s median family income. The provided figures suggest a median family income of $78,671 for 2017—which would be up $3,771, or 5 percent, from the presented median family income in 2011 of $74,900. The projected 2017 figure would be up $2,771, 3.7 percent, from Troxclair’s cited 2012 median family income of $75,900. Asked about those income figures, the city demographer, Ryan Robinson, told us that he wasn’t familiar with a 2017 projection, but the figures for previous years reflected data covering families in the Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos region, not just Austin, that are annually put together by the U.S Department of Housing and Urban Development. Robinson pointed us to a HUD website where we spotted the median family income figures provided by Troxclair’s office for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2011 and 2012. So, median family incomes in the Austin area—extending beyond Austin and Travis County to include Bastrop, Caldwell, Hays and Williamson counties—escalated nearly 4 percent from 2012 to what’s projected for 2017. But that’s a regional figure. We endeavored to seek Austin-only numbers. Austin-only income changes And to our inquiry, a U.S. Census Bureau spokeswoman, Jewel Jordan, pointed us to its estimates of median family incomes in Austin alone, which were based on the bureau’s American Community Survey results for 2011 through 2015. That research suggests bigger jumps in median family income among Austin residents. According to the bureau, Austin’s 2015 median family income of $76,629 was up nearly 13 percent from the $68,023 median family income of Austin residents in 2012 and up 20 percent from the $63,672 median family income of Austinites in 2011. In the same years, the number of Austin families escalated from 66,158 in 2011 and 66,474 in 2012 to 73,928 in 2015 (a three-year, 11 percent increase).

Unfortunately, we didn’t divine a way to figure that out. We noticed otherwise that the Census Bureau’s Austin surveys suggest slightly favorable changes: In 2011, about 26 percent of Austin families had incomes of less than $35,000 while in 2015, that share was down to 21.6 percent. Conversely, in Austin in 2011, 15.8 percent of families had incomes of $150,000 or more while in 2015, 18.8 percent of families were at that level. Troxclair, informed of the bureau’s city-specific income estimates, didn’t defend her reliance on HUD’s regional figures. She noted that city staff had provided her with the regional figures in response to her request for the "average increase in income in Austin" over recent years. City staff comments By email, Van Eenoo, the city’s deputy chief financial officer, confirmed that a colleague had submitted the regional figures to Troxclair’s office without clarifying they weren’t city-only numbers. He further said city staff had calculated the region’s median family income for 2017 by applying the 10-year compound annual growth rate to HUD’s 2016 figure. Van Eenoo, asked why it makes sense to rely on HUD’s regional estimates, noted they’re more up to date than the bureau’s city-specific estimates. Notably too, Van Eenoo said, the HUD data series is the "official data series used to determine eligibility for a wide range of affordable housing programs. We therefore have often relied on the HUD data series because it is the most current official government data series and tracks with other evaluations of housing affordability, whereas relying on the ACS data would require us to make independent projections of income two years into the future in order to compare income versus current property tax levels." We sought his comment on the bureau figures showing median family incomes in Austin trailing the regional HUD estimates; Van Eenoo said city staff hadn’t researched that in depth. Our ruling Troxclair said: "Since 2012," city of Austin "property taxes have gone up almost 30 percent while incomes have only risen 4 percent." Both percentages, we found, have flaws enfeebling this admittedly difficult comparison. In our attempt to be precise, we estimate that city taxes on homesteads in 2016 were up around 8 percent to 11 percent from a few years before with Austin’s median family income in 2015 about 9 percent higher than the city’s median family income in 2012 (though this also almost certainly doesn't reflect income changes for the same specific families). Upshot: City taxes mostly were up, but largely to a lesser degree than Troxclair suggested. Also, the cited regional income figures reflected lesser gains for families than Austin-only estimates available from the Census Bureau. We rate the statement False.

NBC’s David Gregory: "But not what Paul Ryan is suggesting, which is completely changing Medicare." Gingrich: "I, I think that, I think, I think that that is too big a jump.

And I called Paul Ryan today, who's a very close personal friend and I said that. The fact is that I have supported what Ryan has tried to do on the budget. The fact is that my newsletter strongly praised the budget when he brought it out. And the budget vote is one that I'm happy to say I would have voted for. I will defend and I will be glad to answer any Democrat who attempts to distort what I said. And I made a simple mistake." -- Interview on Fox News Channel’s On the Record with Greta Van Susteren, May 17, 2011 *** Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., made a splash when he officially entered the 2012 presidential race in mid May. But it wasn’t exactly the splash he was looking for. In addition to a testy exchange with an Iowa voter that was caught on video, a glitter attack by a gay-rights protester, revelations that he had owed a six-figure amount to the luxury retailer Tiffany’s and a series of articles questioning the accuracy of his facts, Gingrich also took heat from conservatives for an alleged flip-flop on whether he supported the budget plan written by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and passed by the GOP-controlled House. Ryan’s budget includes aggressive spending cuts that have energized conservatives, and changes to Medicare that have outraged liberals. Support for Ryan’s plan has become something of a litmus test for Republicans, especially those running for the GOP presidential nomination. So Gingrich’s stance on the plan was bound to become an issue. Gingrich’s views on Ryan’s proposal have indeed varied over time -- and they’ve also been somewhat more nuanced than the popular reaction would indicate. In a Facebook post on March 17, 2010, Gingrich wrote favorably of Ryan’s previous plan, known as the "Roadmap." The "Roadmap" is broadly similar to the budget resolution passed earlier this year by the House, including in its approach to Medicare. Gingrich’s post called Ryan’s proposal "a comprehensive, bold solution to America’s serious problem of rapidly rising debt. CBO scores the Roadmap reforms as achieving full solvency for Social Security and Medicare and eliminating all long term federal deficits, balancing the federal budget for the long haul. … I know Congressman Ryan remains committed to improving the quality of life for all Americans, both now and in the future, and this Roadmap represents a comprehensive way to achieve that." More than a year later, Gingrich told Time magazine reporter Jay Newton Small that he would have voted for Ryan’s latest plan if he’d been serving in the House. Pressed on whether it would "actually save the health care system," Gingrich responded, "No, I think it’s the first step. You need an entirely new set of solutions." In other words, Gingrich indicated that the plan was worth voting for but added that it was not a silver bullet. A few days after that, in comments at the Brookings Institution on April 23, 2011, Gingrich once again praised Ryan’s big-picture thinking but added that "there are details (of the plan) I disagree with." According to an account in the Daily Caller, one of his reservations involved "cutting investment in science and research." Reductions in science funding envisioned under Ryan’s plan are "essentially like saying I want to save money on your car, we’re not going to change the oil. And for about a year I can get away with it. And then the engine will freeze up, and we’ll have to replace your engine. But if I have a CBO that scores oil but doesn’t score engines, I can annually replace the engine for free, because it won’t count as a budget cost." This seems to reinforce a view that Gingrich supported the proposal, but not without qualifications. Then came the Meet the Press interview on May 15, 2011. Host David Gregory asked Gingrich, "Do you think that Republicans ought to buck the public opposition and really move forward to completely change Medicare, turn it into a voucher program where you give seniors … some premium support and -- so that they can go out and buy private insurance?" Gingrich responded, "I don't think right-wing social engineering is any more desirable than left-wing social engineering. I don't think imposing radical change from the right or the left is a very good way for a free society to operate." After explaining his desire to instead cut waste and abuse, Gingrich insisted that "there are things you can do to improve Medicare." "But not what Paul Ryan is suggesting, which is completely changing Medicare?" Gregory suggested. Gingrich said, "I, I think that, I think, I think that that is too big a jump. I think what you want to have is a system where people voluntarily migrate to better outcomes, better solutions, better options, not one where you suddenly impose upon the -- I don't want to -- I'm against Obamacare, which is imposing radical change, and I would be against a conservative imposing radical change." While Gingrich didn’t explicitly tell Gregory, "I wouldn’t have voted for the Ryan proposal," his stance seems pretty clear to us -- that he did not favor the Ryan Medicare overhaul. So we think it’s fair to say that, after the Meet the Press interview, Gingrich had at the very least done a half-flip on the question of whether to implement the Ryan proposal. But that wasn’t the end of it. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal’s editorial page the day after the Meet the Press appearance, Gingrich backtracked somewhat. He said he had "probably used too strong language" on the show, though he added, "I have thought about this for a long time and I am very, very worried. … I think it would be politically catastrophic to pass the bill in its current form," at a moment when conservatives have an opportunity "to break the left for the first time since 1932." So Gingrich indicated to the Wall Street Journal that he’d overstated his view, but still thought that it would be "politically catastrophic to pass the bill in its current form." Yet there was more to come. As a wave of criticism built, mostly from conservatives outraged at his failure to fully back Ryan’s proposal, Gingrich went on Fox News Channel’s On the Record with Greta Van Susteren on May 17, 2011, to extend and clarify his remarks. "I made a mistake," Gingrich said. "And I called Paul Ryan today, who's a very close personal friend and I said that. The fact is that I have supported what Ryan has tried to do on the budget. The fact is that my newsletter strongly praised the budget when he brought it out. And the budget vote is one that I'm happy to say I would have voted for. I will defend and I will be glad to answer any Democrat who attempts to distort what I said. And I made a simple mistake. ... "So, let me say on the record: Any ad which quotes what I said Sunday is a falsehood and because I have said publicly, those words were inaccurate and unfortunate. And I'm prepared to stand up -- when I make a mistake, and I'm going to on occasion, I want to stand up and share with the American people, that was a mistake, because that way, we can have an honest conversation." In other words, Gingrich used the appearance with Van Susteren to back away from any suggestion that he would have voted against the Ryan plan. As we indicated, a close reading of the Meet the Press transcript shows that Gingrich never precisely said that he would have voted against the Ryan plan. But he certainly made clear that he thought a key provision of the plan -- the changes to Medicare -- were "too big a jump" for him to support. And by saying on Van Susteren’s show that he "made a mistake" in his Meet the Press comments -- a big enough mistake that he felt a need to call Ryan and smooth things over -- it seems like a tacit admission of a flip-flop. We do think that, taken as a whole, there has been more nuance to Gingrich’s stance than some of the coverage has indicated. But his philosophical travels -- from the full-throated Facebook endorsement in 2010, to qualified endorsements in the Time interview and at the Brookings conference, to the downbeat assessment on Meet the Press, to the hasty re-endorsement on Van Susteren’s show -- indicate that Gingrich’s support for the Ryan proposal has ebbed and flowed over time. Gingrich seems to have gone full circle in his views on the proposal, and it qualifies in our book as a Full Flop.	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2011-05-18T19:41:31	2011-05-17	['None']
pomt-07795	Says under his budget-repair bill, "collective bargaining is fully intact."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/18/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-his-budget-repair-/	If Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker isn’t trying to strip most collective bargaining rights from public employees, then why do workers keep pouring into Madison by the thousands to demonstrate against him? Many state, local government and public school employees -- including those represented by the largest state workers union -- have said they would be willing to pay more for pensions and health insurance, as called for in a budget-repair bill introduced by Walker. But the workers continue to protest provisions in the bill that would restrict most public employee unions to bargaining only over wages, and then only within caps. It’s the central issue in the protests, which have drawn national attention. And yet on the morning of Feb. 18, 2011 -- a day after Democratic state senators fled to Illinois to prevent a vote on the bill -- Walker made a startling declaration in a Milwaukee radio interview. At the turn of the 19th century, the Republican governor told conservative talk show host Charles Sykes, Wisconsin adopted the "strongest civil service protections" in the world. Walker then added: "Those fully remain intact. Civil service does not get altered by the modest changes we’re talking about here. Collective bargaining is fully intact. You’ve got merit hiring, you’ve got just cause for termination and for discipline. All those things remain." In the middle of that statement is the eyebrow-raising remark. Collective bargaining would remain "fully intact"? We immediately asked Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie for evidence that would back up his boss’ statement. In the crush of activity in Madison, where the state Assembly took up the budget-repair bill as Walker did the interview, Werwie had not responded by publication time. But let’s take a look at what was said. In contending that collective bargaining would remain fully intact, Walker mixed civil service protections with collective bargaining rights. They are not the same. Civil service protections The protections are put into state law by the Legislature, or into a local ordinance by a city council, or village or town board, said public-sector employer attorney Andrew Phillips. He is general counsel for the Wisconsin Counties Association and his Mequon firm also represents municipalities and school districts. Currently, state employees are covered by civil service, but most local government employees don’t have it and no public school employees do, Phillips said. Phillips said civil service protections, among other things, specify employee rights to things such as vacation and overtime; prohibit termination for reasons other than just cause; and create procedures for employees to file grievances and to have those complaints heard. What they don’t provide, he said, is any right for employees to bargain with their employers over those issues and others. The terms are set by the employer. Collective bargaining rights Two sections of state law -- one for state workers and one for local government and public school employees -- give public employees the right in Wisconsin to collectively bargain. The law issues a mandate to both the employer (the government) and the collective bargaining unit (employees represented by a union). The two sides must "meet and confer at reasonable times, in good faith, with the intention of reaching an agreement" on wages, hours, fringe benefits and conditions of employment. In other words, the workers -- through their union -- have a say in those areas. They do not have such a say under civil service rules. So, what would change if Walker’s budget-repair bill is adopted by the Republican-controlled Legislature? With an amendment approved by the Joint Finance Committee, the bill would require local governments that don’t have a civil service system to establish one, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Alternatively, local governments could establish a grievance procedure that would, at minimum, address employee discipline and workplace safety, and provide for a grievance procedure for employee terminations. Let’s return to Walker’s statement that under his changes collective bargaining remains intact. To be sure, those rights would remain intact for the State Patrol and local police and fire department employees. They are exempt from any of the changes. As for the rest of state, local government and public school employees, Walker’s own Feb. 11, 2011 letter to employees about his plan cited "various changes to limit collective bargaining" to the rate of base pay. The letter also noted other changes, including limiting contracts to one year and requiring annual employee votes to retain unions. Moreover, the bill would repeal all bargaining rights for home health care workers, University of Wisconsin System faculty and academic staff, and employees of University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics. Indeed, Walker also said in the interview with Sykes it was necessary to use his bill to strip collective bargaining rights because when it comes to money the state is broke. He added: "What changes is the fact that no longer can our unions have a stranglehold -- not only on the state government but local government -- to force them to not alter benefit packages that are like a virus eating up our budget." Where does that leave us? In arguing the changes would be modest, Walker cited the civil service system and said "collective bargaining is fully in tact." However, Walker himself has outlined how his budget-repair bill would limit the collective bargaining rights of public employees. Indeed, it’s that provision that provoked daily demonstrations at the state Capitol and national media attention. To now say now say collective bargaining would remain "fully intact" is not just false, it’s ridiculously false.

pomt-06440	Says Anthropology is a STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) field.	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/oct/21/frank-brogan/brogan-claims-anthro-part-stem/	Gov. Rick Scott found himself at war with anthropologists when he told a radio talk show host on Oct. 10, 2011, that Florida doesn't need "a lot more anthropologists." Instead, Scott said, the state needs more graduates in science, technology, engineering and math fields -- shortened often as STEM. (To read more about Scott's spat with anthropologists read this blog item from the St. Petersburg Times.) Scott's pro-STEM, anti-anthropology sounding statement produced loud opposition from anthropologists and liberal arts majors. It also resulted in a simple question from state Rep. Alan Williams, D-Tallahassee, to State University System Chancellor Frank Brogan. At an Oct. 19 House committee meeting, Williams asked: "Is anthropology a STEM?" Brogan responded: "It is." So if anthropology is STEM, and Scott likes STEM, but Scott doesn't like anthropology ... The conclusion of that sentence starts with whether Brogan is right -- that anthropology is a STEM field. And that depends whom you ask. National Science Foundation -- Yes. The National Science Foundation considers anthropology a STEM field, according to Mark Fiegener, a National Science Foundation project officer. Fiegener said that NSF considers anthropology to be part of the "S", or science, in STEM. "NSF considers anthropology to be a field of science – one of the social sciences, to be precise," Fiegener wrote in an e-mail. "Consequently, when we report STEM fields in our statistical reports, the data from or about anthropology departments or students are always counted in the broad 'science' category." U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement -- No. Believe it or not, U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement has a list of STEM programs because the federal government allows foreign students on student visas who graduate with STEM degrees to remain in the U.S. for additional time to receive work experience. ICE announced in May 2011 that it expanded the list of STEM degrees -- but anthropology isn't included. President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology -- Kind of. The council issued a report discussing K-12 STEM education in September 2010. They specifically excluded anthropology as a STEM field for K-12 education, but they also said it was "appropriately considered STEM fields at the undergraduate and graduate levels." Florida Board of Governors -- No. The board, which oversees the state university system and selected Brogan as university chancellor, has designated 103 STEM undergraduate and graduate degrees but not anthropology. The board, working together with the state universities, re-classified the degrees in 2008. Our ruling At a subcommittee meeting a state legislator asked Brogan "is anthropology a STEM?" and Brogan replied: "it is." The National Science Foundation agrees with him, but his own university system and U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement don't. Brogan's response suggests that the answer is simple, but in reality it's anything but clear cut and he should have explained that. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-06267	"The overwhelming number" of school districts reported their staff stayed the same or grew after the 2011-’13 state budget	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/nov/27/scott-walker/walker-says-overwhelming-number-wisconsin-school-d/	As opponents push to recall him, Gov. Scott Walker is working to douse criticism of major cuts in school aid approved in his 2011-2013 budget. In the wake of media coverage of a survey of school districts that showed a net drop of 3,400 education staff spread across more than 350 local districts, he laid out his own view of the numbers. Not every district lost staff, but the cumulative effect was a 5 percent reduction overall. On that point, Walker noted a majority of staff cuts came from just a few large urban districts -- including ones that couldn’t or didn’t take advantage of the change that eliminated collective bargaining with teachers’ unions over health and pension costs. Critics responded that those few districts educate a big share of public school kids. Taking on the survey, Walker went further in a Nov. 15, 2011, interview on WTMJ-AM (620). Host Charlie Sykes asked Walker if his budget had resulted in "significant educational cutbacks in school districts across the state." Walker responded: "No. This is myth vs. reality. You saw a rush to judgment when some folks put that information out. The media wanted to believe that … at least the more liberal biased media wanted to believe that so they immediately assumed it was true." He concluded: "If you actually look at this, it shows just the opposite. It shows the overwhelming number of districts saw that staffing was the same or greater, that there were the same or fewer cuts than before, and in the few areas where they did see significant reductions in staffing, it was places like Milwaukee, Kenosha and Janesville..." We’re working on several statements related to the survey. Here’s our question for today: Did the survey -- done by the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators and analyzed by the state Department of Public Instruction -- show the "overwhelming number of districts" escaped a drop in staff? Let’s start with this note: Walker doesn’t dispute the data in the survey filled out by more than 80% of public school districts -- just the way it was used. In fact, he uses the same data to make opposing points. In the survey, "staff" referred not only to teachers, but to teachers aides, support staff and administrators. Walker argues the raw data actually show a large number of districts where more new staff was hired than was laid off or dismissed by contract non-renewal. We crunched the numbers and he’s right by that method of accounting: More than eight in 10 districts surveyed showed no net loss of staff, and most had gains. There’s a big footnote, however. You won’t find Walker’s numbers cited in the survey’s summary, because the survey calculated the staffing changes using a number -- a critical one -- Walker leaves out: retirements of staff. In all, more than 4,700 school employees retired in the last year -- a level many school officials attribute to Walker’s own budget’s push to force them to pay more for pensions and health care. For each district, the survey arrived at a staff loss or gain by adding up all the staff departures (retirements, layoffs, contract non-renewals) and subtracting the new hires. The survey showed Racine schools, for instance, reported a net drop of 100 staff, mostly teachers aides. But by Walker’s method, Racine shows a net gain of 14, according to our calculations. The reason for the difference: Walker doesn’t count the 114 retirements in the district. When we analyzed the survey results using the complete statistics used to calculate the staff change, we found the opposite of Walker’s conclusion: Three out of four districts reported a net loss of staff, including all four categories of staff. A reduction in teachers drove that result: Nearly two out of three districts (63 percent) reported a net loss of teachers. That trend was much less pronounced in the other categories: for teachers aides, 38 percent of districts saw reductions, we found. For support staff, 31 percent saw a loss. For administrators, 21 percent reported a loss. Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie said the governor excluded retirements because a teacher can retire for any number of reasons unrelated to budgets. True, but the same claim could be made about new hires -- something Walker includes. Indeed, new hires were often necessitated by the retirements. Pulling out just one of the categories unravels any attempt to get at what actually is happening. "We would have had to lay off way more teachers" if 28 hadn’t retired, said Burlington Area School District Superintendent David Moyer. The district rehired 20, according to the survey. Most new hires in the Muskego-Norway district were replacing teachers who retired, said Superintendent Joe Schroeder. Retirements tripled over the previous year. Werwie, the governor’s spokesman, said that ultimately Walker’s counting method shows "new teachers had an easier time getting a job in Wisconsin." That seems like a safe statement, but it’s a different point than saying most districts had the same staffing or greater. Werwie also argued that "staffing" should be judged by broader measures such as class size. It’s possible, he said, for class sizes to hold steady even if staff is reduced because the budget granted freedom from various work rules. In Kaukauna, for instance, the district required educators to teach six hours a day instead of five, as the Journal Sentinel reported. It’s true that very large majorities of districts reported no increase in class sizes -- 74 percent in grades kindergarten to three, and 66 percent in grades 4-6, for example. We think Werwie’s point about judging "staffing" by what happened to class sizes has some merit. Increases or decreases in class size can result from changes in teacher staffing. But enrollment and other factors can affect class size too. In the end, it’s a really a broader topic than the one in front of us on the breadth of the staffing cuts. In any event, Walker’s reference to staffing levels of "the same or greater" makes it clear he was quantifying staffing, not discussing class size. Our conclusion Walker referred to school survey results, saying "the overwhelming number of districts saw that staffing was the same or greater." But he cherry-picked figures in his favor, leaving out a key factor -- retirements -- that formed the basis of the survey’s conclusions on overall staffing reductions. When they are included, the survey actually shows the opposite of what he said. We rate his statement False.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2011-11-27T09:00:00	2011-11-15	['None']
pomt-05073	"If you look at most of the polls, this is a margin-of-error race on Fourth of July between Mitt Romney and the president."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jul/05/chris-christie/mitt-romney-barack-obama-margin-error-race-white-h/	Gov. Chris Christie said a narrow win for the national health care law in the U.S. Supreme Court helped boost President Barack Obama’s poll numbers over his Republican opponent for the moment. But, he said, the race for the White House is a statistical dead heat. "If you look at most of the polls, this is a margin-of-error race on Fourth of July between Mitt Romney and the president," Christie, a top surrogate for Romney, said in an interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box on Tuesday. "And if for any Republican, if I had told them in January, in the middle of the scrum between the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary with Mitt Romney getting beaten up by all those people on the stage, ‘Don't worry. On Fourth of July, it'll be a dead heat race between the president and Mitt Romney’ every Republican would have signed up for that. So let's keep everything in perspective. This is a margin-of-error race. It's going to be a close election. But I think Governor Romney is in [a] really good position right now as the challenger to be able to make the case over the next number of months that he can win," Christie said. Are Obama and Romney facing off in a "margin-of-error race," as Christie claims? PolitiFact New Jersey found most polls back up the governor. We reviewed more than a dozen polls, conducted by different organizations, that asked respondents about who they would vote for in the 2012 presidential election. Only two of those polls found a difference between Obama and Romney that could not be impacted by the survey’s margin of error. A July 2 report from Gallup found respondents split 48 percent in favor of Obama to 43 percent in favor of Romney. That poll had a margin of error of 2 percentage points, not enough to swing the results another way. Charles H. Franklin, professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin, Madison and co-founder of Pollster.com, said "you can easily find some polls where the margin is within the margin of error and a few now and then that are outside the margin of error." But the fact that a poll falls outside of the survey’s sampling error "doesn’t mean that poll was right," he said, citing a June 20 Bloomberg poll that found Obama 13 points ahead of Romney as an example. Recent polls from CNN, Fox News, NBC News/Wall Street Journal, Pew Research and others, show a more narrow spread between Obama and Romney. Though almost all of those polls had the president ahead of his Republican challenger, the margins of error had the possibility of swinging the results in Romney’s favor. A CNN/ORC International poll with a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points released July 2 found Obama ahead of Romney, 49 percent to 46 percent. In a Fox News Poll released June 27, 45 percent of respondents said they’d vote for Obama and 40 percent said they vote for Romney if the election were held today. That survey had a sampling error of 3 percentage points. "In general all the polls show Obama with a lead within the margin of error," said Peter Woolley, executive director of the PublicMind Poll at Fairleigh Dickinson University. But, he said, "I wouldn’t call that a dead heat. I think that’s an optimistic pronouncement. When you have poll after poll that puts Obama a little bit ahead then I would say that you’re pretty confident Obama is a little bit ahead." Our ruling Christie said that "if you look at most of the polls, this is a margin-of-error race on Fourth of July between Mitt Romney and the president." PolitiFact New Jersey reviewed 13 recent polls from different organizations, nearly all of which put Obama ahead of Romney. Only two of those polls showed the president with a lead outside of the margin of error. We rate this claim True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

But before deciding to make three-hour brunches the new healthy workday, PolitiFact Georgia did some checking. We didn’t find the new breakthrough study that some might have been expecting. Rather, we discovered social media abuzz about a study from May 2013 by scientists at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom. Those researchers found that drinking champagne might counteract age-related memory loss and help delay the onset of degenerative brain disorders, such as dementia, according to a press release at the time. Rats, not humans, were subjects in the research. For reasons still unclear, the study’s headline findings went viral on social media and cracked Facebook’s list of trending topics this month, nearly three years after the study. "Three glasses of champagne ‘could help Alzheimer’s disease’" was the headline on The United Kingdom’s Evening Standard’s Facebook post Nov. 9. News outlets picked the story up from social media. Most but not all pointed out that the study was not brand new. The attention prompted Britain’s National Health Service (NHS) to issue a statement Nov. 9, declaring that there’s "no hard evidence champagne can prevent dementia." The agency explained that the University of Reading’s 2013 study was small — it involved three groups of eight rats. n a six-week period, the rats had champagne, non-champagne alcoholic drink, or an alcohol-free drink. Each rat was assessed on its ability to find treats in a maze before and after this period. The main finding: rats given champagne were better at remembering how to find the treat than those given the alcohol-free drink. They found the treats roughly five times out of eight, compared with four times out of eight in rats given the other drinks, NHS said. The agency recommended that the study be repeated with a larger sample of rats and pointed out that "this research has limited direct applicability to humans. "The fact that rats may have performed slightly better in a maze, or demonstrated some protein changes related to nerve adaptability, does not mean champagne definitely reduces the risk of dementia in humans." Ginny Helms, vice president of chapter services and public policy for the Georgia chapter of the Alzheimer’s Association, said the 2013 study was very limited "and not at all conclusive on how champagne or other forms of alcohol can help prevent Alzheimer’s. "No one should drink champagne or other alcohol as a method of reducing the risk of Alzheimer’s disease or other dementia based on this study," she said. "Some studies have found that moderate alcohol consumption may reduce risk of cognitive decline and dementia, but other studies had contradictory results." Absent a cure or major breakthrough, the association suggests a combination of a healthy diet, exercise, socialization and exercise of the mind as the best way to protect the brain, Helms said. Managing critical numbers, such as blood pressure and cholesterol, also is highly recommended, she said. The buzz on champagne started just days before the association released a major report that includes some staggering statistics on the rising financial burden to states of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. Currently, Medicaid programs in 11 states — New York, California, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, Florida, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Illinois, Michigan and North Carolina – pay more than $1 billion a year on individuals 65 and older living with Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia, the association reports. Fast forward 10 years to 2025, and the association estimates that 20 states — Georgia included — will be in this boat. Alzheimer’s and other dementia costs the Peach State’s Medicaid program $989 million this year. But, in 10 years, costs are expected to increase 61 percent to $1.59 billion by the association’s estimates. Our ruling Social media recently resurrected an old study Stories were posted suggesting that drinking champagne could help prevent the onset of Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia. The study is from 2013, not new, as some posts suggested. It was based on testing in a small group of rats, which the National Health Service in Britain says would need to be repeated in a larger sample. And it still might not have any implications in humans. To imply otherwise is very misleading. We rate the statement False.

pomt-05876	The state constitution "clearly says there’s not to be a state income tax in Tennessee."	false	/tennessee/statements/2012/feb/09/gerald-mccormick/house-majority-leader-says-tennessee-constitution-/	Under Senate Joint Resolution 221, given final approval by the Legislature in January, Tennessee voters will decide in a 2014 referendum whether to insert language into the state constitution that explicitly prohibits a tax on personal income. Supporters of the amendment say it’s needed because of disagreements over what the Tennessee Constitution says now. But in House floor debate on Jan. 19, 2012, Majority Leader Gerald McCormick had a different take. With a booklet-sized copy of the state constitution in his hand, the Chattanooga Republican declared: "I’ve got my state constitution out and, even though it clearly says there’s not to be a state income tax in Tennessee, we know we don’t have to go very far to find a judge who will say it doesn’t say what it says. And that’s what has happened before, and the member (sponsor of SJR221) doesn’t want that to happen again." We wondered: If the constitution "clearly says there’s not to be a state income tax," then why the need for a constitutional amendment? Wasn’t it just a decade ago that a Republican governor thought there was enough uncertainty over the issue to push for a state tax on income? The constitution in Article II, Section 28 grants the General Assembly broad authority to levy taxes on all property, real and personal, and to tax "merchants, peddlers, and privileges." There is no mention, one way or the other, on taxing income until the final sentence of the section, which declares, "The Legislature shall have power to levy a tax upon incomes derived from stocks and bonds that are not taxed ad valorem." The state Supreme Court has interpreted Article 28 as it relates to personal income in three notable cases. In 1929, the court upheld the Hall income tax on stock and bond dividends in the case of Shields vs. Williams, basing its decision in large part on that final sentence. In 1932, the court struck down a graduated income tax, enacted by the General Assembly a year earlier, in the case of Evans v. McCabe. The decision rested again on that final sentence, as interpreted in the Shields case. By specifically mentioning a tax on income from stocks and bonds, the court reasoned, framers of the constitution implied an intention that other types of income should not be taxed. In 1960, in a complicated corporate taxation case not directly involving personal income, the court nonetheless included some observations on the subject. An often-quoted line: "Realizing and receiving income or earnings is not a privilege that can be taxed." Against this backdrop of seemingly inconsistent Supreme Court decisions, several state attorneys general have issued a series of formal opinions on the validity of proposals to tax payrolls or income. At least since 1981, the opinions have at least questioned the validity of the past Supreme Court rulings and most, including the most recent opinion by then-Attorney General Paul Summers in 1999, have said that an income tax would be constitutional. Summers concluded: "Upon this analysis, it seems clear that the General Assembly does have the power to levy a properly-structured income tax as a privilege tax imposed on income-producing activities and measured by earnings, as a tax on income as a species of intangible personal property, and possibly as a direct and uncategorized tax imposed under the legislature’s inherent authority." The idea is that, if the Legislature passed a bill deeming the right to earn income a "privilege" or income itself as "property," justices on the high court would rethink the precedents and declare income taxable. Perhaps the most scholarly review of all this comes from the current state attorney general, Bob Cooper, who wrote a treatise on constitutionality of an income tax for the Tennessee Bar Journal in 1992 (he was then in private practice). He concluded that the Supreme Court decision upholding the Hall income tax was "wrongly decided" and that a state income tax would, indeed, violate the state constitution – though the Supreme Court got its reasoning wrong while reaching the right conclusion in the Evans decision. He has not issued a formal opinion on the matter since he has been AG. It seems to us that the constitution is clearly unclear on the taxing of personal income, as attorneys general past and present have declared while reaching different conclusions. Asked for comment about this, McCormick said the constitutionality of a state income tax "is a matter of opinion" and that, "in my opinion, I think it (the constitution) is very clear." But, he added, "We’ve got a lot of legal geniuses who think it’s not." The whole point of amending the constitution is to make things clear. Indeed, the amendment’s preamble states its purpose is "to clarify the language" of the existing ban on a state income tax as interpreted by the Supreme Court. Our ruling The upshot of all this – and we’ve only scratched the surface here of the arguments by lawyers and laymen on both sides -- is that McCormick had things backwards in his statement that the constitution "clearly" says there should be no state income tax. The conflicting court decisions, the wide range of interpretations and the drive for an amendment actually make it very clear that the constitution is not clear. We rate his statement False.

pomt-01265	I spent only $36.29 on my campaign for governor.	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/nov/09/robert-healey/ri-moderate-partys-robert-healey-says-he-only-spen/	Memorable and low-budget -- that's the type of election campaign Robert J. Healey Jr. likes to wage. While the other candidates campaigned for months and spent millions in the most expensive governor’s race in Rhode Island history, Healey didn’t enter the contest until shortly after the September primary, when he replaced the Moderate Party’s original candidate, who was unable to run because of illness. Healey, who has repeatedly run for lieutenant governor with the intention of abolishing the office, and who spent the 2002 election season handing out campaign condoms with the slogan "Nothing never felt so good," got 21.4 percent of the vote after mail ballots were counted in the 2014 gubernatorial election. While the major party candidates, Democrat Gina Raimondo and Republican Allan Fung, saturated the airwaves with commercials, Healey made a few campaign appearances and put up a few signs. But his performance in televised debates in October won him support from a lot of people who like his unconventional style -- or didn’t much like Fung or Raimondo, who won the race. The day after the election, Healey told Providence Journal columnist Edward Fitzpatrick that he spent just $36.29 on his campaign. He made a similar claim on WPRO, where morning host Gene Valicenti congratulated him on his strong showing. "Thank you. For 35, for 38 bucks, not bad," Healey said. "I probably should have spent twice as much. I would have doubled my numbers and maybe be the governor." Valicenti joked that he didn't count gas money. "I know," Healey responded. "(But) I had to go there anyway." The Moderate Party candidate -- who also founded the Cool Moose Party -- has cited similar numbers in other venues. That prompted a reader to question the accuracy of Healey's statements. "Someone had to spend money for those garish signs over I-195. And those signs weren't cheap," the reader said. Indeed, there were more than a few Healey signs throughout the state. We decided to check. Healey's most recent filing with the Rhode Island Board of Elections, for the period ending Oct. 27, 2014, shows that he raised no money and spent nothing during the previous 20 days. His previous report shows that he gave himself $35.31 and spent it all on cell phone expenses. Healey told us the amount jumps to $36.29 when you add the price of the only two purchases he made since his last financial report -- a pair of postage stamps. Filings for the Moderate Party itself show that it spent no money on Healey's race either, at least through Oct. 27. So where did the money for the signs come from? Healey said a lot of supporters downloaded the public-domain images of him and his artwork from his website "so anybody could produce anything." They printed their own. In addition, a local sign maker printed up his own signs and sold them at cost. The candidate also recycled signs from his past campaigns for lieutenant governor. "We just crossed out the word 'lieutenant' and gave those away," said Healey. He also painted a campaign message on the wall of a building using old black paint. He initially had trouble opening the cans of Rust-Oleum paint because the covers had rusted shut. "I found that rather ironic. They should make cans that don't rust," he said. In the end, "I didn't spend any money on signs. Not at all," Healey asserted. In addition, "people printed up a ton of T-shirts. I don't know what people did with them. But we're creating small business in Rhode Island. We're giving people jobs." "We recycled everything -- anything I could cross out the word 'lieutenant.' We recycled buttons. We had some old bumper stickers from when I ran for governor in '98. In the attic, I found a case of Cool Moose combs, which I had in '86. Yardsticks," he said. And did he have any leftover condoms? "We did, but they all expired in 2003. We didn't want to be giving out expired condoms." So when Robert Healey says he spent only about $36 on his campaign, all the evidence points to a truly shoestring operation. We rate his claim as True.

pomt-06789	"Josh Mandel used to be pro-choice, now he’s anti-choice. He used to be sympathetic towards gay and lesbians and now he’s [not]."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/aug/16/ted-strickland/former-ohio-gov-ted-strickland-raps-josh-mandel-fl/	Former Gov. Ted Strickland recently pulled a page from the Ohio Democratic Party’s playbook to attack Josh Mandel, the Republican state treasurer who now appears to be running for the U.S. Senate. Mandel, 33, hasn’t formally announced his candidacy but is raising money for the race and taking shots from Democrats as if he’s an official candidate. Mandel, a former state legislator from Lyndhurst, has his eye on the seat held by Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Avon. Strickland took up for his fellow Democrat in a recent interview with Politico, a national political news website. Strickland framed Mandel as a candidate willing to shift his ideals to further his political career. Strickland told Politico that Mandel – whose likely Senate run has gained the support of the Senate Conservatives Fund – has not always been so staunchly conservative. "Josh Mandel used to be pro-choice, now he’s anti-choice," Strickland said. "He used to be sympathetic towards gay and lesbians and now he’s [not]." Democrats have portrayed Mandel as a political opportunist going back to his run last year for state treasurer, so PolitiFact Ohio decided to check Strickland’s claim to see if Mandel is the shape-shifter his opponents have made him out to be. Let’s slice Strickland’s attack in half, examining the accuracy of each claim. There is no question Mandel is now anti-abortion. He has endorsed the "heartbeat bill," a controversial proposed law banning abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected, which can occur as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. When asked about Strickland’s comments, a spokesman for Mandel’s campaign said, "Josh has always been solidly pro-life and believes all innocent human life should be protected." When we talked to Strickland, he said that Mandel seemed to grow more stringent in his anti-abortion views over time, culminating with his support of the heartbeat bill. Mandel supported exceptions to anti-abortion laws for cases of rape and incest, according to an Ohio Right to Life 2006 candidate survey. On a similar survey two years later, he didn’t list those exceptions to qualify his support for anti-abortion laws. Ultimately, Strickland said he has no evidence to show Mandel ever supported abortion rights. "I’m just going to have to be straight with you, I can’t give you a document or recording that supports what I said," Strickland said. So Strickland’s claim that Mandel used to be "pro-choice" is unsupported. But did Mandel change course on his support for the gay community? When we asked the former governor to back up that part of his statement, Strickland cited quotes from Mandel when he was involved in student government in college, and compared those words with Mandel’s more recent legislative voting record. Mandel was president of the undergraduate student government while he attended Ohio State University. In April 2000, the student government voted to support a domestic partnership plan to allow qualified students to buy student health insurance for their domestic partners, according to The Lantern, Ohio State’s student newspaper. Mandel supported the plan at the time. "The undergraduate student government representatives have been and will continue to advocate for domestic partner benefits in public and private settings," Mandel told The Lantern. "Students want it, students deserve it and the university has a responsibility to provide it." Despite his support for domestic partner benefits in 2000, Mandel nine years later voted against a bill to shield gay and transgender Ohioans from being discriminated against in housing and employment issues. House Bill 176 sought to add sexual orientation and gender identity to the list of classifications for which it is illegal to discriminate for housing, employment and public-accommodation purposes. The bill passed the Democrat-controlled House by a vote of 56-39, with five Republicans joining Democrats to support the measure. But the bill did not go anywhere in the Republican-controlled Senate. Mandel voted against the bill. He was not among a handful of Republicans to explain their vote on the House floor that day. Mandel’s campaign now says he was wrong in college. "Josh has always opposed discrimination against any American citizen and has also always believed that marriage is between one man and one woman," his spokesman, Anthony Conchel, said in a statement. "He also feels he was wrong in college about domestic partner benefits and feels strongly that they should never be funded with taxpayer dollars." So where does that leave us? Strickland claimed Mandel reversed his stances on two social issues – abortion and gay rights. On the latter, Mandel’s legislative voting record and recent statements do not match up with his position in college, and the treasurer now says he was wrong in college. Mandel said he’s always held the same view on abortion rights, and Strickland cannot prove otherwise. So we have to conclude Strickland was wrong there. On the Truth-O-Meter, that two-part statement rates a Half True.	None	Ted Strickland	None	None	None	2011-08-16T10:45:00	2011-07-26	['None']
pomt-06011	"[The] ACLU and atheists in Denver are demanding the NFL stop [Tim Tebow] from praying on the sidelines."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jan/18/john-depetro/talk-radio-host-john-depetro-american-civil-libert/	WPRO radio host John DePetro was chatting on Jan. 13 with Cranston School Committee member Frank Lombardi about the U.S. District Court order to remove a Christian prayer posted on the wall of a high school auditorium when talk turned to football and freedom of expression. With the playoff game between New England Patriots and the Denver Broncos looming, DePetro lamented that things have gotten so bad, "There are atheists in Denver and they're asking the NFL to stop Tim Tebow from praying on the sideline." Lombardi agreed and DePetro went on, bringing the American Civil Liberties Union into the mix. "Look at the mindset you're dealing with," the radio host said. "ACLU and atheists in Denver are demanding the NFL stop him from praying on the sidelines. He's not forcing anyone to join him. He's off in the zone. You see players sitting with their head down. He happens to kneel on one knee. But that is the mindset we're dealing with in 2012." Lombardi joined in, saying he's "concerned about the slippery slope. Where does it end? . . . I don't know where it ends. I'm certainly troubled by Tim Tebow's situation where you're going to regulate private behavior. I think that goes against everything that we stand for." Even we thought that atheists and the ACLU would be guilty of a personal foul if they were trying to get the Broncos’ quarterback in trouble for committing prayer interference. So we went to Google to search for stories about the ACLU-atheist demand to the NFL. We came up empty-handed. So we contacted DePetro. He sent us links to two web pages. The first was a story by the CBS affiliate in Denver headlined "Atheist Group Believes Tebow 'Full Of Crap' With Public Display of Christianity." It quotes David Silverman, president of a New Jersey-based group, American Atheists, and makes no reference to any demand to the NFL or any reference to the ACLU. The second was from the Bad Catholic blog on Patheos.com criticizing Silverman's comments. Again, no reference to any demand to the NFL and no reference at all to the ACLU. We asked Patrick Smyth, executive director of media relations for the Broncos about DePetro's statement. "This is the first I've heard of that," he said. "No, not aware of this," said NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy. "We haven't made any demands," said Silverman, president of the atheist organization. "No law is being broken. He has the right to do it. We think he's wrong to exercise his right this way. But we don't have the right to demand anything because the NFL is a private enterprise. It's like demanding someone say Merry Christmas versus Happy Holidays." Finally, we called the ACLU of Colorado, where spokeswoman Rosemary Harris Lytle said DePetro's statement was not true. "The ACLU would never demand that anyone stop praying. A lot of our work is standing up for [religious] rights, even for people some of us would consider extremists," she said. "We would stand for religious liberty and religious diversity for people of all faith backgrounds" as long as it doesn't violate the separation of church and state. (In fact, the ACLU has a web page devoted to highlighting cases it has supported to protect the rights of individuals to practice or express their religion.) Our ruling Talk radio host John DePetro said, while discussing quarterback Tim Tebow, that the "ACLU and atheists in Denver are demanding the NFL stop him from praying on the sidelines." DePetro's evidence consisted of two web pages that make no such claim. And given the ACLU's history of defending an individual's right to practice his or her religion, the idea that the organization would try to block Tebow from praying when he's not bothering anyone or disrupting a game is ridiculous We've seen the light. It's not from a burning bush. It's from a Pants On Fire! (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)

pomt-13139	Says "Morgan Carroll opposed requiring convicted sex offenders to register their online profiles, making it harder to track online sex offenders and child predators."	mostly false	/colorado/statements/2016/nov/01/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-says-morgan-carroll-voted-against-tracking-ch/	The rating of this fact-check has been changed since it was first published. See editor's note at the bottom. The dogfight over Colorado’s 6th Congressional District is getting nastier as Election Day nears. The National Republican Congressional Committee hammered U.S. Rep. Mike Coffman’s Democratic opponent, state Sen. Morgan Carroll, with two ads echoing the same theme: She was weak on enforcement of sexual predators in the state Legislature. The suburban Denver district is one the of most hotly contested battlegrounds in the nation. We examined an ad called "The Only One," which features a chorus of women condemning Carroll’s actions on two bills. "Morgan Carroll opposed requiring convicted sex offenders to register their online profiles, making it harder to track online sex offenders and child predators," two women say. "And Morgan Carroll was the only one to vote against tougher penalties for child predators using the internet," another woman says. "The only one...the only one...the only one," several women chime in. The NRCC ad cherry-picked votes Carroll made against bills she considered flawed. The ad also leaves out that Carroll voted for House passage of the legislation after she believed it had been improved. We’re fact-checking the statement that "Morgan Carroll opposed requiring convicted sex offenders to register their online profiles, making it harder to track online sex offenders and child predators." In support of the claim, the NRCC pointed to a 2007 bill that Carroll voted on several times as a state representative. The bill sought to require convicted sex offenders register all their email addresses, instant-messaging identities and chat-room identities with the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. It would have also required the CBI to include the information on the Colorado Crime Information Center database, which is shared with state criminal justice agencies. The measure had the support of Colorado Attorney General John Suthers and the Boys and Girls Clubs of Metro Denver. But Democratic lawmakers -- and even some technology experts -- questioned the three-page bill’s enforceability. "You can create a brand new email address in minutes," Steve Walden, an executive at Pitney Bowes Group 1 Software, told the Denver Post at the time. "I think the intent here is that various chat-room communities can flag these users while they're online," said Walden, whose firm developed software that allows people to use online maps to see how close they live to registered sex offenders. "The Internet is one of those domains where they can roam with complete anonymity. Tying an email address to a person is a very difficult thing to do." Carroll campaign spokesman Drew Godinich said she was all for tracking sex offenders online, but she believed flaws in the bill would allow predators to evade detection. "There was no provision in the email portion of the bill that would guarantee that someone's email address actually belonged to that person. If someone had to register as a sex offender, they could -- under this bill -- create an email under a fake name and there was no enforcement," Godinich said. After the bill's enforceability was questioned by lawmakers and during public testimony at a committee hearing, Carroll voted with other Democrats to kill it. What the NRCC ad doesn't mention is that three weeks later, a new, more comprehensive bill for online tracking of sex offenders was introduced. The bill required that law enforcement agencies "make a reasonable effort to verify all email addresses provided by the (sex offender)." It also required that the registration form a sex offender must fill out contains a warning that providing false information for their email, instant-messaging and chat-room identities "may constitute a misdemeanor or felony offense." Carroll joined a bipartisan group of 59 lawmakers in voting for final House passage of the stronger bill (HB07-1326). The ad leaves out that inconvenient fact. However, there was another twist. The Senate stripped out the House language requiring law enforcement to verify the email addresses a sex offender registers. So Carroll voted against the weakened conference committee bill that became law. Carroll's spokesman said she supported sex offender tracking but voted against the bill that weakened enforcement of tracking. NRCC spokesman Zach Hunter told us, "While legislating may be a messy process, when Morgan Carroll was faced with the binary choice of supporting or opposing legislation that would require convicted sex offenders to register their online profiles, Carroll opposed the bill. If all legislators had voted like Carroll, the bill would have failed and no further protections for our most vulnerable would have become law." A word about the second claim While the ad's second claim — "Morgan Carroll was the only one to vote against tougher penalties for child predators using the internet" — is not on the Truth-O-Meter, it’s worth reviewing because it’s also misleading. It refers to a 2009 bill that sought to update the state law against internet luring of a child to include texting and instant-messaging. It also would have allowed a judge to consider a defendant's prior sex offense convictions in other states when weighing the severity of sentencing. The bill passed the House. When it came to the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Carroll was serving, she joined the unanimous vote to advance the bill. Then the sausage-making of legislation got messy. Two Republican senators each successfully added an amendment to the bill, which passed in the initial Senate floor vote. One amendment would have increased the penalty for failing to register as a sex offender. The other amendment would have added prohibitions against providing sexually explicit material -- pornography -- to children. Carroll objected to the amendments, saying they violated the Colorado Constitution’s requirement that each bill only contain a single subject, which must be clearly expressed in the bill title, her spokesman said. The purpose of the constitutional provision is in part to prevent "log-rolling," where lawmakers bundle together unrelated measures to win votes for passage, according to the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Legal Services. Carroll also argued that the bill needed a new fiscal note because the amendments would boost its cost, Godinich added. This is how Carroll became the lone vote against final Senate passage of the bill. But it didn't end there. The House rejected the Senate amendments. And a conference committee, where lawmakers iron out the two chambers' differences on a bill, stripped out the amendments. In the end, Carroll voted with unanimous Senate passage (HB09-1163) of the original bill to increase penalties for online child predators -- which the TV ad, again, failed to mention. Our ruling The NRCC said, "Morgan Carroll opposed requiring convicted sex offenders to register their online profiles, making it harder to track online sex offenders and child predators." The NRCC blows one of Carroll's committee votes out of proportion to make it sound like she was philosophically against this policy. Carroll did vote to kill the orginal sex offender bill in committee, because she -- along with other Democrats -- said the bill lacked language to prevent a sex offender from creating an email address with a fake name to evade tracking. But she voted for successful passage of another tracking bill with teeth when it was in the House. It required law enforcement to verify a sex offender's email addresses, and it carried criminal penalties for anyone who provides false information about their email or other online identities. When that bill came back from the Senate, the tougher enforcement measures had been stripped out, and Carroll voted against it. The NRCC ad ultimately distorts Carroll's position by saying she opposed making sex offenders register their online profiles when she actually fought for tougher enforcement. We rate this statement Mostly False. Editor's note: This fact-check originally posted with a rating of False. Shortly after publication, the NRCC pointed out Carroll's vote against the final measure when it came back from the Senate, which we did not consider. We updated the piece and revised the rating. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/967b2e0d-12c3-4508-9b55-838e2db70b9c	None	National Republican Congressional Committee	None	None	None	2016-11-01T15:24:27	2016-11-25	['None']
pomt-00185	"The House GOP super PAC in DC is spending more to help my opponent than anyone else."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/19/paul-davis/no-super-pacs-arent-spending-most-amount-money-boo/	As we close in on the last month before the midterms, the ad wars continue to escalate. Political groups are pouring money into congressional districts to make their candidates look good, or more often, opposing candidates to look bad. It is going on all over the country, but Paul Davis’ campaign claims that an outside GOP PAC is spending the most in Kansas’ 2nd Congressional District. In a recent tweet, Davis, the Democrat running for the seat that includes Topeka, Lawrence and communities west of Kansas City, said that "the House GOP super PAC in DC is spending more to help my opponent than anyone else." It is true that the Congressional Leadership Fund - the leading GOP super PAC affiliated with House Republican leadership - is pouring money into the district, but the Davis campaign is exaggerating. Davis is one of the top targets of the super PAC, but he's not No. 1. Here, we look at just how much is being funneled into the district from CLF and how it measures up to other House races around the country. What the Davis campaign says The Davis campaign told us the claim is based off a CNN report released in late September. In the report, CNN examined the top districts where the Congressional Leadership Fund was spending its money on ad buys. It found that, as of Sept. 21 (when the report was published), CLF had poured $1.9 million into the district, nabbing the top spot on its list. Colorado’s 6th Congressional District and California’s 48th followed with $1.6 million and $1.5 million spent by CLF. Most of the television advertising were attacks on Democrats. This is definitely visible in KS-2. In September alone, the PAC aired four attack ads against Davis. How much is actually being spent in the district by outside groups and CLF We checked the OpenSecrets.org database, a widely cited campaign finance tracking resource published by the Center for Responsive Politics. Interestingly, the database shows that so far in the race, CLF has spent more than $3.2 million, nearly double CNN’s estimate, but still doesn’t list the district as the top one for the group's spending. Besides more than $6 million spent attacking Jon Ossoff, who lost to Republican U.S. Rep. Karen Handel in a 2017 special election, the top Democrat CLF is spending against is Democrat Joe Radinovich, who is running against Republican candidate Pete Stauber in Minnesota's 8th District. So far, CLF has spent nearly $3.9 million against him. But while Davis isn't the top Democrat that CLF is spending money against (he comes in at No. 7), the KS-2 race overall takes 4th place when factoring in the money the super PAC has spent in support of Watkins. Races CLF $ Against Democrats CLF $ For Republicans Total $ Spent 1. California 39th $3,839,570 $94,442 $3,934,012 2. Minnesota 8th $3,893,273 $8,660 $3,901,933 3.

Minnesota 3rd $2,664,035 $63,944 $2,727,979 Our ruling The Davis campaign says that the House GOP super PAC is spending more to help out Watkins than anyone else. The Republican Super PAC is airing a torrent of attack ads against Davis and spending a lot of money in the district. But records show that Davis is not the top taget for CLF, though the district is listed among the top 5. Still, that doesn’t make Watkins the top recipient of such efforts.

pomt-00419	Says "96 percent of (Google News) results on ‘Trump News’ are from National Left-Wing Media."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/29/donald-trump/no-96-google-news-stories-trump-arent-left-wing-ou/	In a pair of early-morning tweets, President Donald Trump took aim at Google’s system of search results, saying it was biased against outlets that are friendly to him. In two successive tweets on Aug. 28 (later deleted and reposted to correct a spelling error) Trump wrote: "Google search results for ‘Trump News’ shows only the viewing/reporting of Fake New Media. In other words, they have it RIGGED, for me & others, so that almost all stories & news is BAD. Fake CNN is prominent. Republican/Conservative & Fair Media is shut out. Illegal? 96% of … results on ‘Trump News’ are from National Left-Wing Media, very dangerous. Google & others are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good. They are controlling what we can & cannot see. This is a very serious situation-will be addressed!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The part where Trump said that 96 percent of "results on ‘Trump News’ are from National Left-Wing Media" caught our eye. A close look at the source of the statistic suggests that Trump’s figure is dubious. Where does the figure come from? The White House didn’t respond to an inquiry. The 96 percent figure appears to come from a post on PJ Media, a conservative site. The Aug. 25 story had attracted some attention in conservative media circles before getting picked up by Trump. "Is Google manipulating its algorithm to prioritize left-leaning news outlets in their coverage of President Trump?" Paula Bolyard, PJ Media’s supervising editor, wrote in the article. "It sure looks that way based on recent search results for news on the president." To test the premise, Bolyard performed a Google search for "Trump" using the search engine's "News" tab and analyzed the results using a media bias chart. Of 76 total stories, most came from outlets such as CNN, the Washington Post and NBC. Only three came up from the Wall Street Journal, which is labeled right-leaning by the chart. Bolyard wrote that she repeated her search "multiple times using different computers (registered to different users) and Google returned similar results." Bolyard acknowledged that while the study is "not scientific," though she did conclude that "the results suggest a pattern of bias against right-leaning content." But this conclusion is debatable, and Trump’s reporting of the results is more problematic still. Factors that go into Google searches There is broad agreement that the factors that go into Google’s algorithms for news searches are opaque. And the lack of transparency can allow theories about ideological bias to flourish. They "depend on a lot of factors, including what other people are searching for, what they're clicking on, what sites link to a given search result, whether the website is optimized for mobile, and even whether the site supports encrypted HTTPS," said Jeremy Gillula, tech policy director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. "But with all that said, Google's search algorithms are still a black box, and we'd prefer if Google gave users more information and control over the factors that influence search results." In a statement, Google said that ideological factors do not play a role in its algorithms. "When users type queries into the Google Search bar, our goal is to make sure they receive the most relevant answers in a matter of seconds," the statement said. "Search is not used to set a political agenda, and we don't bias our results toward any political ideology. Every year, we issue hundreds of improvements to our algorithms to ensure they surface high-quality content in response to users' queries. We continually work to improve Google Search and we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment." Even if one considers Google’s algorithmic factors to be "biases," that doesn’t necessarily mean they are ideological biases. Searches, for instance, are widely believed to favor newer content and original sources rather than aggregations. At the very least, there should be a fair amount of variability in search results over time. A study made during one snapshot in time, such as the one published in PJ Media, will not produce the same results a few hours later, as new articles come online. Bolyard, in an email interview with PolitiFact, noted that she mentioned some of the caveats in her article. In the article, she cautioned that "factors such as the relevance of the topic, the design of the website, internal and external links, and the way articles are written and formatted all can affect a site's Google traffic. Google is constantly tweaking their algorithm, and a website's traffic prospects can rise or fall depending on the changes." However, Trump made no indication in his tweets that the findings could be chalked up to anything beyond ideological bias. Rating news outlets’ ideology A more problematic aspect of the study is the metric used to label websites. To determine "left" and "right," Bolyard used a chart of media outlets assembled by Sharyl Attkisson, a former CBS correspondent who hosts the Sunday morning program "Full Measure" for Sinclair Broadcasting, a network of local stations that has taken a pro-Trump editorial stance. Here’s the version of the chart Bolyard linked to: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com The chart is not neutral evidence supporting Trump’s point, and it labels anything not overtly conservative as "left. In the "left" category are such rigorously mainstream outlets as the Associated Press and Reuters. The three big broadcast networks — ABC, NBC, CBS — are considered "left," as are the Washington Post and the New York Times. Other media outlets that produce a large amount of content every day, including CNN, NPR, Politico, USA Today, and CNBC, are labeled "left." This means that most of media entities that produce large amounts of widely read and cited news content -- factors that might well give them a leg up in the Google algorithm -- are defined by the chart, and thus by the PJ Media study, as "left-wing." So, by its design, the study guarantees that an enormous percentage of Trump news coverage would falls into what the chart defines as "left." Full disclosure: PolitiFact and its owner, the Poynter Institute, are both listed on the chart as left of center. We actually consider ourselves not to have an ideological leaning. "It’s a ‘study’ designed to come up with the outcome it came up with, and it did just that," Chip Stewart, a professor at Texas Christian University’s Bob Schieffer College of Communication. Moreover, the "left" category lumps these large-staffed, comprehensive news outlets in with genuinely liberal-to-left outlets, such as the Daily Kos, Salon, the Nation, Huffington Post, Talking Points Memo, and Media Matters. A more revealing comparison would be to compare search results of truly left-wing sites vs. truly right-wing sites. In a written description of the chart, Attkisson acknowledged that the graphic is "subjective" and writes that "position on the chart doesn’t necessarily imply credibility or lack thereof. Sources on far right and far left have, in many instances, produced excellent, factually correct information at times." Bolyard agreed that "any chart that attempts to quantify media bias is going to be inherently subjective." But she added that "while it may be fair to quibble with Attkisson's assertion about how far left-of-center some major media outlets are, I think it's entirely fair to say that outlets like NBC, the New York Times, and CNN skew to the left, especially in their coverage of the president." Stewart, however, rejected the notion that the algorithm has ideological bias. "A far more plausible explanation is that the items that drive the algorithm — links, shares, etc. — are more common among the so-called liberal publications, which have a long track record of credible journalism and try to cater to a wider audience," he said. Either way, Trump used the 96 percent figure without taking into account any of these methodological concerns. Our ruling Trump tweeted that "96 percent of (Google News) results on ‘Trump News’ are from National Left-Wing Media." This figure is based on a non-scientific study from a conservative website that categorized any media outlet not expressly conservative as being part of the "left." These outlets include wire services, broadcast networks and most major newspapers and collectively account for a large percentage of original news reports produced in the United States. The methodology essentially preordains that a large percentage of coverage captured by Google will be what the study defines as "left," which is wrong. We rate the statement False.

pomt-14286	Says Erv Nelson voted "yes on the pro-amnesty SJR 21, a bill urging Congress to provide citizenship for those residing illegally in our country."	mostly true	/nevada/statements/2016/apr/05/victoria-seaman/immigration-debate-enters-key-nevada-state-senate-/	The federal immigration debate is turning into a down-ballot issue in Nevada. Assembly freshmen Erv Nelson and Victoria Seaman are entwined in an ugly Republican primary battle for a critical state Senate seat that holds the potential to tip the balance in the 11-10 Republican-controlled state Senate. Seaman has relentlessly attacked Nelson, and one of her campaign flyers accuses him of supporting a "pro-amnesty" immigration bill. "Why did Erv Nelson vote yes on the pro-amnesty SJR 21, a bill urging Congress to provide citizenship for those residing illegally in our country?" Because immigration is an important topic in Nevada — a state with a "top share of unauthorized immigrants" — we wanted to fact-check this claim. The accusation leads back to a resolution approved by bipartisan majorities in both houses of the Legislature in 2015: Senate Joint Resolution 21. Nelson voted for the resolution, while Seaman and 10 other Assembly Republicans voted "no." It passed unanimously in the Senate. The only Assembly member to comment on the resolution’s passage was Republican Michele Fiore, who called it a "warm and fuzzy feel-good bill" only to be used for "political benefit" in future elections. "Since it basically does nothing, I urge my fellow colleagues to support SJR 21," she said during a marathon Assembly session shortly before midnight on May 22, 2015. The resolution is straightforward. It’s little more than two pages listing facts about immigration and urging Congress to take up the issue, and to include "earned legal residency accompanied by a clear path to citizenship." It rehashes similar legislation also approved by bipartisan majorities in 2013. So claiming Nelson voted for a bill that included support for a pathway to citizenship is accurate, as the resolution clearly spells out. But calling the resolution "pro-amnesty" is harder to prove. In response to questions from PolitiFact, Seaman’s campaign sent a two-page letter arguing that a pathway to citizenship is equal to amnesty, as "citizenship is a measure of permanent legal relief targeted at a specific group of people." Use of the word "amnesty" in immigration policy is contentious, and there’s no agreed upon metric by which the word should be used. PolitiFact did look into use of the word "amnesty" by Republicans critical of President Barack Obama’s proposed immigration policies in 2011 and 2012, but it’s much more difficult due to differences in the 1,200-page immigration bill in 2013 and the two-page resolution approved by lawmakers in 2015. In general, amnesty is defined as granting permanent immunity from punishment for a group of people who have broken the law. It’s true that granting citizenship to people not legally in the country would prevent punishments like deportation and broadly serve as "amnesty", but the resolution is just so vague that it’s difficult to call it "pro-amnesty." A 2011 PolitiFact check found that use of the politically charged word is "debatable and so charged it should come with a lot more explanation." The resolution additionally doesn’t really do anything other than, in the words of one supporter, "send a strong message to Congress" to take up immigration reform. Nelson didn’t answer multiple calls seeking comment, but neither candidate played much of a role on any of the 2015 bills that could have actually affected the undocumented immigrant community. Both lawmakers voted for a successful measure making it easier for immigrants with temporary legal status to get a teacher’s license in Nevada. And neither Seaman nor Nelson played a role in a measure prohibiting contractors from hiring unauthorized immigrants, which failed to pass out of committee. Ultimately, there just isn’t a lot that state-level lawmakers can do on immigration policy outside of "symbolic" gestures like the immigration reform resolution, as it’s almost entirely a federally managed issue. Nevada did approve driver authorization cards for people not legally in the country in 2013, but neither Seaman nor Nelson was in office at the time. It’s worth noting that Seaman appears to have voted for the resolution during an earlier committee meeting, according to legislative records requested by PolitiFact. A video of the meeting is online, but it’s difficult to tell if she’s present during the voice vote. That isn’t necessarily an endorsement, as many lawmakers will vote to get legislation out of committee to the floor so more lawmakers can weigh in. Seaman’s campaign manager claims she was not in the room during the vote. Our ruling Seaman says Nelson voted "yes on the pro-amnesty SJR 21, a bill urging Congress to provide citizenship for those residing illegally in our country." To be clear, the "bill" was actually a resolution that holds no teeth. It calls for a pathway to citizenship for people not legally in the country. But it's too vague to blankly say it falls under the "amnesty" umbrella, and just doesn’t mean much in the grand scheme of the immigration debate. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-01366	"Elorza wants to teach our public school children about the ‘non-existence of God.’"	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2014/oct/19/Local-799-international-assoc-fire-fighters/providence-firefighters-union-says-elorza-wants-te/	"Extremist." That’s one of the ways the Providence firefighters union describes Democratic mayoral candidate Jorge Elorza in a recent mailing to city residents. The mailer was sent out in early October 2014, by Local 799 of the International Association of Fire Fighters, which has endorsed Elorza’s opponent, Vincent A. "Buddy" Cianci Jr., in the race for mayor. It listed three reasons to vote against Elorza. The first? He lacks experience. The second? Elorza, the firefighters say, supports a municipal income tax. PolitiFact Rhode Island examined this claim when it was made by Cianci last month and ruled it False. The third? "Elorza wants to teach our public school children about the ‘non-existence of God,’" the piece said. The basis for the claim is cited in the mailer: an article that Elorza, a law professor and former Housing Court judge, had published in the University of Pittsburgh Law Review in 2010. The 54-page article, "Secularism and the Constitution: Can Government Be Too Secular?," sets out to answer a question. "If scientific evidence leads us to conclude that a particular aspect of God cannot be true, can this be taught in the public schools?" wrote Elorza, who is on a leave of absence from Roger Williams University School of Law, where he teaches constitutional law and other subjects. The article defines four views of God: the atheist view in which God does not exist; the deist view, which holds that God created the universe but has no influence on daily events; the theist view, which holds that God is not only the creator but also an intervenor in the world’s affairs; and what Elorza calls the "memist" view in which God lays down a moral code but "resides entirely in the minds of its adherents." Elorza focuses on the theist view, arguing that it violates the laws of physics. Science, he says, proves that the theist God does not exist. And U.S. courts have generally ruled that something can be taught in the public schools that may contradict a religious belief if science supports it. Evolution is one example that Elorza gives. As for the three other views of God, Elorza makes it clear that their existence cannot be proven one way or another. Thus, no argument can be made to support teaching that they do not exist, and doing so would violate the Constitution, according to Elorza. So what is his answer to the question that he posed at the beginning of the article? "I conclude, first, that teaching that the theist God does not exist would not violate any of the underlying values and second, that the consequences of doing so are not as far-reaching as may be initially believed," Elorza wrote. Elorza may have concluded, in his lengthy academic paper, that it is legally defensible to teach the non-existence of one particular aspect of God, but nowhere in the article does he say that he wants schools to teach it. Much has been written by others on local blogs on this subject (see here and here), but we couldn’t find any public statements made by Elorza advocating for schools to adopt the position. In fact, he said just the opposite during a WPRI-12 debate in August, when asked by reporter Ted Nesi about the law review article. "I don’t seek to have this be taught in the public schools," Elorza said. "This is a hypothetical that I laid out over 60 pages in an academic article." "And it’s not something that you would seek to implement in the Providence schools?" Nesi asked. "Absolutely not," Elorza replied. (See the exchange here, starting at 28:40.) Derek Silva, secretary of the firefighters’ union, told us that Elorza is now trying to distance himself from the article. When we contacted Elorza’s campaign, his spokesman, David Ortiz, defended the candidate. "Jorge was raised Christian," Ortiz said in an email. "He believes in God. He does not want to teach atheism in schools, and has never made that suggestion anywhere." Our ruling The Providence firefighters union says that Jorge Elorza is an extremist who wants public schools to teach that God does not exist. But their only evidence is a misreading of a 2010 academic article Elorza wrote. Nowhere in the 54-page article does Elorza say he wants public schools to teach that there is no God. Elorza has said repeatedly that’s not his view and we could find no public statements by him that suggest otherwise. This is an inflammatory claim that has no basis in fact. It’s a good thing the firefighters union has experience dealing with flames, because we rule this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-02730	The United States is "behind many countries in Europe in terms of the ability of every kid in America to get ahead."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2013/dec/19/steven-rattner/it-easier-obtain-american-dream-europe/	Oh, sweet America, ye land of opportunity, home to the time-tested formula in which hard work + perseverance = success, in spite of family background. Or not. The new reality, as described in a Dec. 16, 2013, discussion on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, is it’s harder than ever for Americans born into low-income families to advance up the economic ladder. Middle-class economic growth is stunted compared to other parts of the developed world, and it’s hard for people to work their way out of poverty, said Steven Rattner, a Morning Joe economic analyst and former Treasury Department official who oversaw the restructuring of the auto industry under President Barack Obama. "We have fallen way back," Rattner said. "We're behind many countries in Europe in terms of the ability of every kid in America to get ahead. It's a real problem." Why is that? host Joe Scarborough asked. They talked about the globalization of the job market and increased poverty. Rattner’s statement betrays our classic view of the American Dream. Is his point accurate? Rattner researcher Sundas Hashmi directed us to reports that bolster Rattner’s statement. The takeaway: The American rags-to-riches story is more out of reach than ever, possibly responsible for restricting economic growth. The Great Gatsby Curve We last heard a version of this talking point from the president himself, who spoke at length recently about the dangerous consequences for America if income inequality continues to rise and income mobility decreases. "In fact, statistics show not only that our levels of income inequality rank near countries like Jamaica and Argentina, but that it is harder today for a child born here in America to improve her station in life than it is for children in most of our wealthy allies, countries like Canada or Germany or France," Obama said. "They have greater mobility than we do, not less." Alan Krueger, former chairman of the president’s Council of Economic Advisers, explained the connection between economic mobility and income as the "Great Gatsby Curve," named after the novel about Prohibition-era upper-class excess by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Families at all earning levels were growing together after World War II but have been growing apart since in the decades since, Krueger wrote. The country’s top earners have pulled a lot further ahead than the middle and lower class, he said, and the trend line suggests the future earnings of today’s children will be tied more and more to the income level of their parents. "Not since the Roaring 20s has the share of income going to the very top reached such high levels," Krueger said, according to prepared remarks. Krueger compared income inequality of 10 developed countries with the correlation between a parent’s income and their children’s (it’s more complicated than we described, check out the details in Krueger’s presentation or this Bloomberg infographic). The "Gatsby Curve" showed economic possibilities for children in European countries such as Finland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Germany and France were much less connected to their parents’ income than in the United States and United Kingdom. Evidence from Pew and others Other research hits similar notes. A 2011 short report by the Pew Charitable Trusts’ Economic Mobility Project described a joint study by researchers from 10 countries who looked at how children’s mobility is connected to their family’s socioeconomic background. They used parents’ education as a measure because it has strong ties to income and offered cross-country comparisons. Of the 10 countries studied, the United States had the strongest link between parents’ education and a child’s economic, educational and socio-emotional outcomes, the study found, more pronounced than in the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Nordic countries, as well as Canada and Australia. "Americans absolutely confirm they believe America is the land of opportunity and that people should have equal opportunity if they have the skills," said Diana Elliott, research officer for the Pew Charitable Trusts’ Economic Mobility Project, in an interview. "The data fly in the face of what Americans have believed and what they say they believe in our polling work." Pew researchers use data from a long-term survey that started tracking 5,000 families in 1968 and follows those parent-child pairs as they form their own households (known as Panel Study of Income Dynamics). Since economic mobility is best measured when people are in their prime working years around age 40, we won’t have a third generation comparison for another decade or two, Elliott said. The United States has a greater degree of "stickiness," in which people at both extremes of the income distribution are likely to stay in the quintile into which they were born, than neighbor Canada, she said, referencing this report. The Brookings Institution and Pew Charitable Trusts teamed up on a 2008 report that analyzed several studies on economic mobility and concluded the following: Cross-country comparisons of relative mobility aren’t always based on perfect data. But the United States is distinct from other countries, research shows, in having "less, not more, intergenerational mobility than do Canada and several European countries." Upward mobility is particularly uncommon for children who are born into families at the lowest income bracket. A previous examination of this issue by PolitiFact Ohio mentioned a 2010 study by the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, a Paris-based think tank with 34 member countries, including the United States. The study found Denmark, Australia, Norway, Finland, Canada, Sweden, Germany, Spain and France out-ranked the U.S. in terms of a child’s ability to earn more than his or her parents. Only Italy and Great Britain had stronger links between a person’s earnings and his or her parents than the U.S. of the 12 countries evaluated. Why is this happening? A 2012 New York Times article that examined five studies about the United States' lagging economic mobility identified the depth of American poverty as one culprit, as the country has a "thinner safety net" than other wealthy nations. Other potential reasons the Times reported include the increased likelihood of poor Americans to be raised by single mothers, decreased unionization, high incarceration rates and the country’s historical racial divide. A college education is one way for children born into the lowest income distribution to move up despite their family background, noted a report by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. But for many born into the poorest bracket, college is out of reach. Just 7 percent of adults whose parents were in the bottom income quintile obtained a college degree. Disagreement, caution and another measure Is it time to ring the alarm? Not yet, say some economists of conservative backgrounds. Among their concerns of the methodology and thrust of some of the research we have described: It is not wise to compare U.S. data with considerably smaller, more homogenous populations in European countries, such as Denmark. The evidence is scant that income inequality is hurting or driving our country’s economic woes. Looking at absolute mobility, or comparing a person’s income to their parents’, reveals a different story than isolating the measure that most of these studies used (that’s relative mobility, or looking at where an adult landed in the income distribution compared to his or her parents). For children born into the lowest quartile, 83 percent made higher family incomes than their parents, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, which examined the same long-term family survey that Pew uses. As a whole, 67 percent of U.S. adults out-earned their parents. Thing is, we don’t have solid comparisons for absolute mobility for other countries, said Donald Schneider, a Heritage researcher who addressed his concerns about international comparisons of economic mobility in a whopping 6,700-word piece. We won’t visit each point here (this is getting long enough -- eat a cookie, you deserve it). Basically, he cautioned the data used for some of these studies is not collected in the same way, and cultural differences could account for some of the income gaps. Plus, he wrote, Americans have to make more money to move from the bottom to the top than in countries such as Denmark. But many see that as the problem, said Julia Isaacs, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who studied international comparisons of generational income mobility in 2007. More distance means more inequality. "We have more distance from the top to bottom," she said, "and whether that’s a good or bad thing may depend on your point of view." Our ruling Steven Rattner said, the United States is "behind many countries in Europe in terms of the ability of every kid in America to get ahead." Some conservative economists say the comparisons between countries are imperfect, that we need better data, and Americans are doing just fine if you look at their ability to simply out-earn their parents. We don’t know how that compares to European countries. But many studies back up Rattner’s point. Studies show that we are behind "many countries in Europe in terms of the ability of every kid in America to get ahead." Nordic countries have particularly higher rates of income mobility than the United States. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-05193	"As Governor: Romney did not keep public safety funding in line with inflation."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/12/american-bridge-21st-century/democratic-superpac-ad-blasts-romney-record-fundin/	A pro-Democratic super PAC, American Bridge 21st Century, released a Web ad critical of Mitt Romney that attacks his record on public safety as governor of Massachusetts. The ad, unveiled June 7, 2012, features a cartoon image of Romney driving a police car, an image that plays off a recent report that alleges Romney played numerous pranks as a young man, including impersonating a police officer. "Romney might think his pranks are funny, but his record on police issues is no joke," the ad says. The ad offers several specifics on Romney’s tenure, one of which is: "As Governor: Romney did not keep public safety funding in line with inflation." When we contacted American Bridge 21st Century, spokesman Chris Harris said the group used figures from the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center, an affiliate of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which offers a user-friendly budget-tracking tool at its website. The group looked at the category "law and public safety," which shows a decrease for the period 2002 to 2007 when using figures adjusted for inflation for government purchases. The decrease was small -- less than 1 percent cumulatively over the five-year period. But this is only one of the ways to look at the question. In fact, analyzing Massachusetts budget questions is a particularly thorny task. First, determining the proper time frame for judging Romney’s tenure is tricky, since the governor’s term doesn’t line up precisely with the state’s fiscal year. Romney would have had no influence on the 2002 budget, but he would have had responsibility (along with the Legislature) for the second half of the 2003 budget, as well as authority (again, with the Legislature) for 2004, 2005 and 2006, and, finally, for the first half of the 2007 budget. We asked budget experts which time frame would be most appropriate, but there was no consensus. We’ll look at two time spans below. Second, the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center offers two methods for adjusting by inflation -- one for prices of items typically purchased by governments (the one used by American Bridge) and one adjusted for consumer prices overall. We’ll look at both. And third, the category American Bridge used -- "law and public safety" -- isn’t the only one available. Beneath that heading on the budget tool are sub-categories more narrowly targeted toward public safety, including, "law enforcement," "prisons, probation and parole," and "prosecutors." Combining these three categories into one measurement avoids lumping in court operations, many of which stem from civil actions rather than criminal cases. Meanwhile, another line item that sheds some light is "local aid," since many public safety activities in Massachusetts are paid for by localities, partly using revenues handed down from the state. Now let’s look at various combinations of these calculations: Combination of "law enforcement," "prisons, probation and parole," and "prosecutors," adjusted by government-purchase inflation measurement: Fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2007: 5 percent increase Fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2007: 8 percent increase Combination of "law enforcement," "prisons, probation and parole," and "prosecutors," adjusted by overall inflation: Fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2007: 15 percent increase Fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2007: 17 percent increase So, using these figures, Romney’s record actually shows an increase beyond inflation, not a decrease. Local aid, adjusted by government-purchase inflation measurement: Fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2007: 17 percent decrease Fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2007: 3 percent decrease Local aid, adjusted by overall inflation: Fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2007: 9 percent decrease Fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2007: 6 percent increase Romney did cut local aid below the rate of inflation in three out of the four calculations we did. However, local aid is a less precise measurement, since it is allocated in a variety of ways, not just for public safety. Also, because local officials would have a say in how much to fund their own law-enforcement departments, Romney wouldn’t be solely to blame for local law-enforcement cuts made during his tenure. Finally, we should note that a Democrat, Deval Patrick, followed Romney as governor, and his record has been one of contracting spending compared to inflation. Between 2007 and 2012, the combination of "law enforcement," "prisons, probation and parole," and "prosecutors," adjusted for government inflation, plunged by a whopping 17 percent. Our ruling There are ways to fiddle with the numbers so that spending on "public safety" declined compared to inflation while Romney was governor. But there are more ways, and we think more credible ways, to calculate it that show spending increases on Romney’s watch. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-14715	Says U.S. Rep. Ted Yoho said "African Americans should only be given three-fifths of a vote."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2015/dec/30/viral-image/facebook-post-accuses-us-rep-ted-yoho-wanting-stri/	A viral image on Facebook falsely accused U.S. Rep. Ted Yoho, R-Fla., of saying black Americans should only have three-fifths of a vote. A curious reader pointed us to the image, which reads: "This guy is Republican Florida Representative Ted Yoho who said this week that African Americans should only be given three-fifths of a vote. He is an elected member of Congress and he actually said that… OUT LOUD. You stay classy Florida." We looked into it and found that there’s no evidence whatsoever that the Republican congressman said that. It appears that the meme’s creator was duped by a satirical website. We learned the image was from a Facebook user in California named Mark Kusler, who based it on a story on Politicalo.com. The website posts some real news, but it also posts satirical stories with exaggerated content. The site includes a "Show Facts" button that allow readers to highlight which parts of their stories are true and which are not. But the viral image — which has been shared more than 3,000 times — does not say any part of its message is untrue. So what’s the real story? On May 20, 2014, liberal website RightWingWatch.org ran a story about video footage from a stop at Berean Baptist Church in Ocala during Yoho’s 2012 congressional campaign (not last week, as the image said). During the appearance, Yoho blasted allowing an uninformed electorate into polling places and decried early voting through absentee ballots. He wrapped up by noting voting laws were much more restrictive in the past. "I’ve had some radical ideas about voting, and it’s probably not a good time to tell them, but you used to have to be a property owner to vote," he said in the video. He didn’t say anything about black voters, but the next day Politicalo.com made it appear Yoho said inner-city black constituents who rented their homes didn’t deserve to have the same voting power. Politicalo included Yoho’s actual comment about being a property owner. Then the site added a made-up quote: "The founding fathers didn’t have early voting, why should we? We need to go back to what the founding fathers intended. No early voting. No absentee voting. No renters voting. And a black man’s vote counts as three-fifths of a white man’s. It’s what God intended." The YouTube video of the appearance cuts off at the point where Yoho would have said the latter comments on Politicalo, which echoed the U.S. Constitution's three-fifths compromise of 1787 that allowed Southern states to count slaves as three-fifths of a person for the sake of representation and taxation. But we found no proof he actually said the United States should make African-American votes count less than white votes. An administrator from Politicalo pointed out to PolitiFact Florida that the quote was not highlighted by the "Show Facts" button, meaning it was fabricated by the post’s writer. People For the American Way, the parent of Right Wing Watch, confirmed to us that Yoho didn't say the things Politicalo added. That’s not to say Yoho’s comment about voters historically being property owners didn’t face some backlash. Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said in 2014 that Yoho’s assertions "harken back to another century when Americans were denied their basic rights as citizens" and "should be roundly condemned in the strongest possible terms." Yoho spokesman Brian Kaveney told MSNBC in an email that "the congressman was making a reference to how voting was structured when America was in its infancy (from a historical perspective). He does not believe that this is the way it should be now." Our ruling A viral image said Yoho said "African Americans should only be given three-fifths of a vote." There is no evidence Yoho said anything specifically about black voters in a 2012 campaign appearance in Ocala. The image was taken from a satirical news story on a satire site that twisted Yoho’s words about voting rights to make him appear biased against black voters. While Yoho has talked about reducing early voting, the post goes too far in using a fake quote to make it appear the congressman wants to strip away African Americans' civil rights.

pomt-06458	"Over the last several years, 40 percent (of) the jobs created in Texas were created for illegal aliens."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/19/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-hits-rick-perry-saying-40-percent-texa/	During the Oct. 18, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Las Vegas, Mitt Romney sought to undermine Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s argument that he’s presided over rapid job creation during his tenure. "If you look over the last several years, 40 percent, almost half the jobs created in Texas, were created for illegal aliens, illegal immigrants," Romney said. Romney was referring to a study titled, "Who Benefited from Job Growth In Texas? A Look at Employment Gains for Immigrants and the Native-Born, 2007 to 2011," published by the Center for Immigration Studies, a research group that supports reducing illegal immigration. The report analyzed U.S. Census Bureau data and found that immigrants, both legal and illegal, "have been the primary beneficiaries" of job growth in Texas since 2007, even though native-born workers accounted for 69 percent of the growth in the state’s working-age population over the same period. Specifically, the report said that, of the jobs created in Texas since 2007, 81 percent were taken by newly arrived immigrant workers, both legal and illegal. In the meantime, the group estimated that about half of the newly arrived immigrants who took jobs in Texas beginning in 2007 were illegal. As a result, the report estimated that about 40 percent of job growth in Texas since 2007 went to newly arrived illegal immigrants. So Romney’s comment described the results of the study pretty faithfully, though it would have been more accurate if he’d referred to jobs "given to illegal aliens," rather than "created for illegal aliens." The study doesn’t suggest that Texas employers were conspiring to create jobs specifically for illegal immigrants, only that illegal immigrants ended up filling them. However, we see two additional issues that call into question the accuracy of the study itself: The 40 percent figure uses gross numbers of immigrants rather than net numbers. The report actually offered calculations using two sets of numbers -- one using the total number of immigrants coming into the state, and the other using that number minus the number of immigrant departures and deaths. Using the net immigrant figure -- the one Romney didn’t use -- results in a lower percentage. The figure using net immigration is about 54 percent. And once you divide that by two to estimate the share for illegal immigrants, the relevant number is about 27 percent, not 40 percent. So Romney has effectively cherry-picked the higher of two percentages offered in the report. Both the 40 percent figure and the 27 percent figure are subject to a wide margin of error. Jeffrey S. Passel, senior demographer for the Pew Hispanic Center, an independent research organization, said that "there are lots of methodological problems with the CIS study, mainly having to do with the limitations of small sample sizes and the fact that the estimates are determined by taking differences of differences based on small sample sizes." In addition, the assumption that 50 percent of immigrants are illegal is an educated guess, but still a guess. Meanwhile, the Census data used in the report is a longitudinal survey, which means that Census employees check back periodically with the same participants. "How many undocumented folks do you honestly think would be participating in that?" asks Sarah Jane Glynn, a policy analyst with the liberal Center for American Progress. Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, added that the report did not drill deeper into the data than "working age." "Even within the working-age population, it might be the case that the immigrant population may have disproportionately grown in age groups -- say, ages 25-49 -- where employment rates are highest," he said. "A really sophisticated analysis might show that, given the age distribution of net immigrant population growth and net native population growth, immigrants got exactly the proportion of new jobs a good forecaster would predict." Given the data, though, we "just don’t know," he said. The report does acknowledge that "no estimate of illegal immigration is exact." But the methodological shortcomings also weaken the certainty of Romney’s statistic. On balance, we think that both the report’s authors and its critics have reasonable points. In the big picture, we agree with Chuck DeVore -- a conservative critic of the study -- that "trying to draw conclusions about immigration and employment in Texas in isolation from other factors is problematic at best." But we also agree with Mark Krikorian, the Center for Immigration Studies’ executive director, that "even if DeVore prefers a net-to-net comparison, immigrants still got a disproportionate share of new jobs." Our ruling In the debate, Romney cited the report’s headline figure pretty accurately. But he failed to note, first, that it was an estimate subject to significant uncertainty, and second, that the report itself included an alternative -- and arguably more accurate -- measurement that produced a significantly lower figure. That said, the lower figure, even when adjusted for uncertainty, still backs up Romney’s underlying point that illegal immigrants have gained a disproportionate share of new jobs in Texas. It’s just that the number probably isn’t as high as Romney said in the debate. So we rate the statement Half True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2011-10-19T12:58:58	2011-10-18	['Texas']
pomt-02850	The U.S. Department of Defense spends $80 million a year on prostate cancer research, $25 million a year on ovarian cancer research and $150 million a year on breast cancer research.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/nov/19/saxby-chambliss/senator-questions-some-areas-defense-budget/	Remember the classic U.S. Army slogan? "We do more by 9 a.m. than most people do all day," a voice said in the famous commercial. What you may not know is that the military is doing some significant multitasking. In addition to chasing down terrorists and conducting humanitarian rescue missions in places such as the Philippines, the Defense Department is also working to prevent and cure some of the deadliest diseases known to mankind. U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., recently said the medical research may not be the best use of Defense Department resources. "What I don’t understand is why the … military is spending $80 million a year on prostate cancer research, why we’re spending $25 million a year on ovarian cancer research and $150 million on breast cancer research. We’re also doing lung cancer research," Chambliss said during a Nov. 7 meeting of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Chambliss wants additional money for the Defense Department, but he says it should be spent wisely. "Now if there are particular needs that the military has regarding military research and there are some, particularly because of the casualties we’ve suffered recently, I can understand it," the senator continued. "But these are types of research that simply have no place in my opinion in (the Defense Department). They ought to be done in (the National Institutes of Health)." Chambliss complained there is little coordination between the research done by the Defense Department and the National Institutes of Health. PolitiFact Georgia was unaware that the Defense Department was doing that kind of research. We’re not early-risers like the Army. We embarked on a mission to determine whether the senator was correct that the military was conducting research on these serious conditions and whether his math was correct about how much in taxpayer dollars it was spending on such work. In late 1992, Congress began to set aside annual funding toward research of various illnesses and diseases to be done by the Defense Department. Some of the research is for conditions that appeared directly related to the battlefield, such as Gulf War Illness and traumatic brain injuries. Other research is for conditions faced by Americans that are not necessarily military-related. The list of conditions includes, as Chambliss noted, breast cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer and prostate cancer. As Chambliss told it, the now-deceased Sen. Ted Stevens, an Alaskan Republican, asked for some prostate cancer research dollars to be allocated to the Defense Department. Chambliss said Stevens later realized those funds should be allocated to the NIH. We looked up the most recent funding totals for the various forms of research. The Defense Department Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs website said $80 million was spent in fiscal year 2013 on prostate cancer research, but the totals were slightly less for the other forms of cancer Chambliss mentioned. The website said $20 million was spent on ovarian cancer research and $120 million on breast cancer research in FY 2013. The 2013 federal fiscal year began Oct. 1, 2012, and ended Sept. 30. Lauren Claffey, a spokeswoman for Chambliss, said he was using numbers for fiscal year 2010. To sum up, Chambliss said the federal government gives the U.S. Department of Defense $80 million a year for prostate cancer research, $25 million a year for ovarian cancer research and $150 million a year for breast cancer research. The senator is correct that there is such a program. The numbers are slightly off for two of the three forms of research. Chambliss used numbers three years older than the most recent material.

pomt-03329	Says last year "13 million (health insurance) rebates went out, in all 50 states. Another 8.5 (million) rebates are being sent out this summer, averaging around 100 bucks each."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/24/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-millions-benefit-insurance-compa/	President Barack Obama is trying to get ahead of a steady rain of attacks on his signature health care reform law, the Affordable Care Act. With House Republicans voting to delay key elements of the law and Americans for Prosperity, a well-funded conservative group, running television ads to stir sentiments against it, Obama focused on health care when he spoke last week at the White House briefing room. Among the changes due to the law, the president touted the tangible benefit of consumer rebates from insurance companies that have spent too much on administrative overhead. "Last year, millions of Americans opened letters from their insurance companies," Obama said. "But instead of the usual dread that comes from getting a bill, they were pleasantly surprised with a check. In 2012, 13 million rebates went out, in all 50 states. Another 8.5 (million) rebates are being sent out this summer, averaging around 100 bucks each." In this fact-check, we examine whether millions of Americans received rebates on the scale the president described. Why we have rebates in the first place Part of the law requires health insurance companies to spend at least 80 percent of each premium dollar to provide care, rather than cover administrative expenses. There’s some wiggle room on the 80 percent, but by and large, this is called the medical loss ratio and people speak of it as the 80/20 rule. If an insurance company spends less than 80 percent, it must send the difference back to the customer. That is the rebate. Most insurers already meet the standard. The Government Accountability Office said that in 2010, two-thirds of the firms passed muster. But behind that figure was an important difference among insurance policies. For companies selling to large employers with over 100 workers, 77 percent were in compliance. For those selling to small employers with 100 or fewer workers, 70 percent met the grade. But in the individual market, where people buy their insurance directly and don’t get it through their employer, only 43 percent of firms met the 80/20 rule. Obama’s numbers At one level, the official data tells all. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services track all rebates and indeed, in 2012, insurance companies returned $1.1 billion to about 12.8 million policy holders. In 2013, the dollars are about half as much and about 8.5 million policyholders benefit. The average rebate is $98, which is pretty close to Obama’s $100. Over 2.7 million households in the individual market received a rebate directly. We should note, though, that 61 percent of the rebate money went to employers. That is to be expected since about 85 percent of all people with private insurance get their coverage through their employer. The employer buys the insurance so the employer gets the rebate. Nearly all the time, the employer and the employee share the cost of health care premiums, and the law requires that the rebate be split proportionately. It gives employers the option to pay workers their share in a lump sum, reduced premiums in the future or "applying the rebate in a manner that benefits its employees." We have not found any government agency that tracks how firms share the rebate. We did find this guidance to employers from the U.S. Labor Department. It said the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) applies and as far as what companies do with the rebate, employers "must act prudently, solely in the interest of the plan participants and beneficiaries." One final point. Individuals saw a rebate check more often than you would expect. These customers represent just 15 percent of the private insurance market. But they made up 32 percent of the households that got rebates. Our ruling Obama said "millions of Americans opened letters from their insurance companies" and got rebates from companies that failed to spend at least 80 percent of premiums on care. Then he talked about 13 million rebates going out last year and about 8.5 million this year. Those numbers are generally accurate. But while Obama gets the numbers right, he left a misleading impression about the rebates going directly to so many people. In fact, more than half of the rebates went to the employers that run health plans for their workers. Federal law says the employers have to use the money on health care, but they can also use it shore up the health plans. So not all of these policy holders are getting $100 directly. For these reasons, we rate Obama's statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2013-07-24T16:36:11	2013-07-18	['None']
pomt-09909	"In Wisconsin, the stimulus paid for a bridge to a bar called Rusty's Backwater Saloon. They've got great burgers, but no new jobs."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/07/john-boehner/boehner-ad-says-stimulus-paid-bridge-rustys/	In a hokey Web ad from House Republican leader John Boehner last week, the GOP "releases the dogs on the money trail" to find jobs created by the Obama-backed economic stimulus package. The stimulus was supposed to be all about jobs, according to the folksy narration by Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, R-Ga., "but after five months and billions in debt on our kids and grandkids, where are the jobs?" Here's what the job-sniffing GOP bloodhound Ellie Mae finds: "In Wisconsin, the stimulus paid for a bridge to a bar called Rusty's Backwater Saloon," Westmoreland says. "They've got great burgers, but no new jobs." The 85-foot bridge in question spans Rocky Run, a creek off the Wisconsin River in Stevens Point, Wis. The project to replace the bridge got $840,000 in stimulus money. State bridge inspection reports show the bridge carries an average of 260 vehicles a day. According to Dale Peterson, Portage County assistant highway commissioner, most of the traffic using the bridge is people going to and from the Wisconsin River Golf Course (a public course). It's also used by crews for Consolidated Paper driving to the company's waste treatment plant. And there's a small development going in, about 20 homes, whose residents will use the bridge. That's why the 20-year projections show the average daily usage doubling to nearly 600 cars per day. So what about Rusty's Backwater Saloon? A few of its customers may use the bridge. But not many, according to Peterson and someone we spoke with at the saloon. The main route to Rusty's is via a more direct highway access nearby. Peterson suspects the Republicans used Rusty's as the example because "I imagine it made good print." The ad makes it seem like this is a bridge only to Rusty's. It's not. In fact, Rusty's business would do just fine without it because there are other routes to get to the bar. But we don't want to ignore the ad's bigger point, which is that stimulus money is being spent on a little-used bridge. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel did an investigative report of stimulus-funded bridge projects in Wisconsin and found that the vast majority of the bridges awarded money in the first wave of stimulus funding are small, rural bridges that carry less than 1,000 vehicles a day. The Stevens Point bridge is one of 37 little-used bridges that got nearly $16 million in stimulus funding, while many higher-priority, well-traveled bridges were ineligible for the first round of stimulus funding. That's because so-called "shovel-ready" projects moved to the front of the line for the first round of stimulus money, state highway officials said. The idea of the stimulus was to get people working on projects that could be started fairly quickly. What does shovel-ready mean? It means the projects have environmental assessment and Army Corps of Engineers permits in hand and engineering and design work is finished. In the case of our little Stevens Point bridge, it has been in the works since 2006. It was designed and ready to go when the stimulus passed in February. In fact, it was originally slated to be replaced in 2009 but got pushed back to 2010 due to lack of available federal funding. "This wasn't some project we cooked up when the stimulus was passed," Peterson said. "All it needed was funding." Construction is set to begin in August and is expected to take about three months. Peterson estimates a crew of about a dozen will be used to build the bridge. And the concrete and steel will be purchased locally. So presumably that will create some economic ripple as well. Built in 1937, the bridge is in need of replacement, Peterson said. If it isn't, he said, ultimately they'd have to shut the bridge down, and "that would affect quite a few people. And more people would be out of work." "It does serve a purpose," Peterson said. "I'm happy this is being replaced." The GOP ad ends with Boehner kneeling behind a hound dog on a manicured lawn. "I'm John Boehner," he says. "This is Ellie Mae. She hasn't found any stimulus jobs yet. And neither have the American people. It's time to stop runaway spending in Washington and help small businesses get the economy running once again." Boehner didn't just pluck the Rusty's crack from thin air. On his Web site, he cites a June 16, 2009, story from the Wall Street Journal that mentions the bridge. It comes in a story about a report from Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., called "100 Stimulus Projects: A Second Opinion." Coburn's report says, "One small bridge is receiving $840,000, though it only carries 260 vehicles a day on average. It primarily provides access to a golf course and Rusty’s Backwater Saloon, which boasts pontoon rentals and a Steak-A-Rooni for just $5.25." We realize this Web ad from Boehner was a tongue-in-cheek attack. And let's face it, "Rusty's Backwater Saloon" creates a nice visual. But when you single out a project — as Boehner did with the "Bridge to Rusty's" — we think he ought to have his facts straight. And the fact is, this Wisconsin bridge is not a bridge solely to Rusty's, as the ad implies. In fact, it's not even the main access point for Rusty's. And as for the project not creating jobs, we think Ellie Mae's sniffer is a bit off there too. The main point of the stimulus wasn't so much to create burger-flipping jobs on the other end of bridge construction projects, but to to create jobs for people doing the bridge work itself, thereby creating an economic ripple effect. And according to a Wisconsin highway official, at least a dozen construction workers will be used to replace the bridge. But because some people may use the bridge to get to Rusty's, and because there's a legitimate argument to be made that many small, rural and barely used bridges got stimulus money while other bigger (arguably more important) projects were ineligible, we'll give Boehner a Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03157	Says U.S. Rep. Tom Price is sending letters both supporting and opposing the "small-business killing Internet Tax Mandate."	false	/georgia/statements/2013/sep/09/georgia-campaign-liberty/price-guilty-tomfoolery/	Who’s side are you on, congressman? That’s the question some Georgia activists are asking U.S. Rep. Tom Price. The Georgia Campaign for Liberty recently distributed fliers that contend the Roswell Republican "is trying to have it both ways on the small-business killing Internet Tax Mandate." "Rep. Price has been sending letters in support of the Internet Tax Mandate to constituents who support it … and letters expressing concern over the Internet Tax mandate to his constituents that oppose it!," the flier states. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether the organization was correct in its assertion. The Campaign for Liberty states on its website that it believes "the free market ... is the most just and humane economic system and the greatest engine of prosperity the world has ever known." The Virginia-based group also supports a "noninterventionist foreign policy" and opposes the Federal Reserve system, according to its website. The organization’s interim state coordinator, Ike Hall, sent us a copy of the flier to support its argument about Price. Hall did not know how many fliers were distributed, but the flier has been posted on various websites, which is how we saw it. On the back of the flier are two letters Price wrote to different constituents concerning the issue. Both letters were nearly identical. The key difference is one paragraph. Before we examine the contents of the letters, PolitiFact Georgia thought we’d briefly offer some context about this issue. On Feb. 14, a group of U.S. House lawmakers introduced Resolution 684, titled the Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013. The legislation was intended to allow states to collect taxes on some items sold online. One study concluded that in 2012 Georgia lost about $455 million in uncollected Internet sales tax revenue. "Small businesses and states alike are suffering from the inability to collect due – not new – taxes from purchases made online," said Rep. Steve Womack, an Arkansas Republican who was a lead sponsor of the legislation. "The Marketplace Fairness Act is the bipartisan, bicameral, common-sense solution that promotes states’ rights and levels the playing field for our Main Street businesses rather than continuing to allow the government to pick marketplace winners and losers." The Senate passed the legislation in early May by a wide majority. Both U.S. senators from Georgia, Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson, voted for the legislation. The resolution was referred to a House subcommittee. Some activists have fought the legislation. A Facebook page was created to urge House members to hit the delete button when the legislation comes their way. Grover Norquist's influential Americans for Tax Reform has labeled it a tax increase. Former Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul, chairman of the Campaign for Liberty, has described the bill as an "Internet tax mandate." The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in May that Price was unsure about his support for the bill. Price has not publicly stated a position on the bill. His office told us the congressman doesn’t want to see any changes to the tax code that would hurt the economy. Many members of Congress face difficult political choice on the legislation. Many local business communities support the tax. They contend that not charging taxes on Internet purchases gives online merchants an unfair advantage. But many taxpayers, who also vote, view the legislation as creating a new tax. The Georgia Campaign for Liberty, like its national chairman, has qualms about the legislation. It accuses Price of "two-faced taxation Tomfoolery," using the letters as evidence. Hall said it received the letters from supporters and says Price has admitted he’s "waffled" on his position. One letter, to a supporter of the legislation, was dated July 10; the other, to an opponent, July 12. There are two differences in the letters. The second paragraph of the July 10 letter begins "Your support for this legislation is appreciated." The second paragraph of the July 12 letter begins "Your concerns for this legislation are appreciated." The only other difference in the letters was a sentence in the third paragraph. "At a time when regulations and taxation are out of control at the federal level, it is critical that we continue to examine avenues that involve a complete and comprehensive overhaul of our tax system so that we may see a positive effect and simplification of our tax code," Price wrote in the July 10 letter. The July 12 letter has a sentence that begins the same, but ends differently. "At a time when regulations and taxation are out of control at the federal level, it is critical that we do not potentially inflict further damage on an already delicate economic recovery. Responsible solutions are needed to ensure the survival of our small businesses." So, is the Georgia Campaign for Liberty correct that Price is trying to have it both ways? "As all can clearly see from the text of the letters themselves, any claim the congressman is expressing support for the bill in one letter and opposition to it in another is baseless," Price spokesman Ryan Murphy said in a statement. "Any accusation that he is trying to provide two opposing opinions depending on the audience is a blatant PolitiFact ‘Pants on Fire’. The letters clearly show the congressman being consistent and responsive to the concerns of his constituents." Hall chuckled when we read Price’s statement to him. "We stand by our flier," he said, declining to comment further. To sum up, the Georgia Campaign for Liberty put together a flier accusing U.S. Rep. Tom Price of Georgia of writing letters for and against legislation that would allow states to tax some items sold online. The letters were nearly identical. And they are indicative of everyday correspondence from a congressman’s office to constituents concerned about pending legislation. Part of one sentence could be interpreted as suggesting Price has problems with the bill. But the organization’s conclusion about the congressman’s position is a stretch. Our rating: False.

pomt-03355	Says Austin is the "largest city in America without a congressional district anchored in it."	true	/texas/statements/2013/jul/17/elliott-naishtat/austin-legislator-calls-austin-largest-us-city-wit/	During Texas House action, two Travis County Democrats discussed whether Austin is weird in a politically unique way. From the House floor’s back mic on June 20, 2013, Rep. Elliott Naishtat asked fellow Austin Rep. Eddie Rodriguez: "Did you know that Austin is the only major Texas city and the largest city in America without a congressional district anchored in it?" Rodriguez replied from the front of the chamber: "Sadly, I am aware of that fact. Austin is now the 11th largest city in America and yet we don’t have a congressional district that’s based here, anchored here in Austin." That so? Austin's six districts We’ve analyzed Austin’s congressional districts before. In July 2012, we rated as Mostly True a Seguin resident’s claim that no like-sized or smaller city than Austin has as many congressional representatives. Austin and Fort Worth were somewhat similarly divided up in the map of Texas congressional districts imposed by federal judges, we concluded, though Austin was arguably socked harder because its voters wouldn’t necessarily determine victors in any of its districts. And does that also mean Austin lacks an "anchor" district, as Naishtat said? Six U.S. House districts take in at least a portion of the city under the interim plan imposed for the 2012 elections by a panel of federal judges. The court-imposed Austin-area districts align with how the districts were drawn by the Republican-led 2011 Legislature. As far as Austin by itself goes, two of the congressional districts each took in 24 percent of city residents at the time the map was finalized, another drew in 22 percent of city residents, the fourth had 19 percent of the population and the remaining two districts each had less than 8 percent of Austin residents, . And Austin residents don't dominate any of them, according to information posted online by the Texas Legislative Council in February 2012. By our calculation, some 27 percent of residents in both the 10th and 35th districts hail from Austin. That share of residents might be seen as signaling a little pull, but it’s also not close to a majority. Notably, too, the eastward-stretching 10th District, represented by Michael McCaul, R-Austin, is home to more Harris County than Travis County residents, while the southward-running 35th district, held by Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, encompasses more Bexar County than Travis County residents. Each other district taking in part of the capital has a smaller share of Austin residents. About 25 percent of residents of the 21st district, extending south into San Antonio and represented by Alamo City Republican Lamar Smith, hail from Austin. Austinites make up 22 percent of the 25th district, running west and north nearly to Fort Worth; Republican Roger Williams, a Fort Worth-area businessman, moved to Austin before winning the seat in 2012. Less than 10 percent of residents of the north-running 17th and 31st districts, held by Republicans Bill Flores and John Carter, respectively, live in Austin. What's an anchor? We asked two redistricting experts how to define an anchor district. Austin lawyer Steve Bickerstaff had already aired his impression of how Austin and surrounding Travis County came out when the Republican-majority Legislature was drawing congressional districts, a task that comes around after each decennial U.S. census. In a March 24, 2012, commentary published in the Austin American-Statesman, Bickerstaff said the legislatively-initiated splitting of Travis County among several districts was "clearly intended to dilute, not enhance, the effect of the county's voters (especially Democrats)... These objectives are not surprising for a Republican-controlled Legislature, because Travis County is the only major Texas county in which a majority of non-Hispanic white people continue to vote consistently for Democratic candidates." But what about "anchor" districts? By email, Bickerstaff told us that in his experience, an "election district is ‘anchored’ in a jurisdiction in the purest sense if the district is wholly contained within the jurisdiction." For instance, Bickerstaff said, the Texas Constitution requires Texas House districts to be located entirely within a county, with a few specific exceptions. The next question can become, then, whether a district within a county is anchored in a particular city or neighborhood, he said. But Bickerstaff said an election district may be called "anchored" in a jurisdiction (such as a county, city or neighborhood) even if it contains more than one jurisdiction if the voters of the singled-out jurisdiction constitute at least a majority of the district’s voters. "The bigger the majority, the more secure the anchor," he said. In a reminder that most everything connected to redistricting law has a wiggle or three, Bickerstaff added that one may also define the relevant majority based on a district’s voting-age population, which would be a bigger group than registered voters alone. Also, he said, one could define a majority in terms of a district’s total population or even accept less than a majority to define an anchor when the singled-out jurisdiction "clearly has the largest plurality of voters or population in the district (and usually votes as a bloc)." Broadly, Bickerstaff wrote, the "key concept is that the voters of an anchor jurisdiction have the potential ability to elect the person of their choice without much, if any, regard to the vote of any other jurisdictions in the election district. Of course, the ultimate outcome of elections is more complicated. It is possible that even when a jurisdiction has a majority, or nearly so, of a district, the elected candidate may come from outside the jurisdiction especially if the voters in a smaller jurisdiction vote overwhelmingly for one candidate and the voters in the larger or anchor jurisdiction split more evenly." As an example, he said, the 2012 election of Doggett, long from Austin, despite the fact that Travis County residents do not account for most district residents. By email, Dallas lawyer Michael Li said he is unaware of a precise definition of an anchor district, but "in general, a district's anchor has the ability to control or substantially influence the outcome of elections because it contains the majority or a substantial plurality of the district's population." So, by the measure that we found accessible--raw population--Austin lacks an anchor district. But is that status unique among cities of like size or bigger? More populous cities Shortly before Naishtat made his claim, the U.S. Census Bureau ranked Austin as the nation’s 11th-most-populous city. A May 23, 2013, bureau press release had a link to a chart showing Austin with nearly 842,600 residents as of July 2012. More populous cities, the bureau said, were New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Antonio, Dallas and, in California, San Diego and San Jose. Naishtat’s office emailed us a chart, attributed to Nate Walker, Rodriguez’s chief of staff, indicating that each of the more populous cities had at least one anchor district. It was hard for us to decipher, so we checked on anchor districts in each of the larger cities with help from David Wasserman, U.S. House editor for the Cook Political Report, who told us by phone that he would define an anchor district as one in which more than half its residents live in the city. By that gauge, he said, each of the cities larger than Austin has at least one anchor district, while Austin does not. Specifically, Wasserman said, New York has more than a dozen House districts, Los Angeles has several and Chicago residents comprise most of the population in three districts. In Texas, he noted, Houston residents account for most of the 18th and 29th congressional districts and Dallasites largely comprise the 30th district; San Antonio residents anchor the state’s 20th district. Philadelphians account for most residents of Pennsylvania’s 1st and 2nd districts, Wasserman said, while Arizona’s 4th Congressional District is in Phoenix. In California, he said, the 52nd district draws largely on San Diego residents and most of San Jose is in the 19th district. Checking for ourselves Next, we looked at maps and other materials posted online by government agencies and U.S. House members, which suggested: Multiple districts within or largely within New York, Los Angeles and Chicago; Residents of Houston comprise more than half the population of the 7th (53 percent Houstonians); 29th (55 percent); 18th (62 percent); and 9th (74 percent) districts, according to information posted online by the Texas Legislative Council, while Dallas indeed has one anchor district, the 30th, in which six of every 10 residents live in the city; Pennsylvania’s 2nd Congressional District consists almost completely of Philadelphians, according to Maisha Leek, chief of staff for Rep. Chaka Fattah, D-Philadelphia. And Arizona’s 7th Congressional District is largely comprised of Phoenix residents. Maura Saavedra Cordova, press secretary to Rep. Ed Pastor, D-Phoenix, told us by telephone that according to the 2010 U.S. census, nearly 595,000 of the district’s 710,224 residents--84 percent--lived in Phoenix. California’s 52nd Congressional District consists of nearly the entire city of San Diego, according to the August 2011, final report of California's Citizens Redistricting Commission, which drew boundaries: "The district is highly urbanized with regional parks, lakes, and open-space preserves and is the central social and economic hub of San Diego County"; California’s 19th Congressional District "encompasses most of San Jose." Our ruling Naishtat said Austin is the "largest city in America without a congressional district anchored in it." Austin has portions of six districts and Austinites don’t come close to comprising the majority of residents in any of them. In contrast, the nation’s 10 more populous cities have at least one such district. We rate this claim as True.	None	Elliott Naishtat	None	None	None	2013-07-17T10:00:00	2013-06-20	['United_States']
pomt-09240	Says the EPA "outsourced the scientific basis for its greenhouse gas regulation to a scandal-plagued international organization that cannot be considered objective or trustworthy."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/may/10/greg-abbott/attorney-general-abbott-says-epas-endangerment-fin/	Greg Abbott, the Texas attorney general seeking re-election this year, announced a state challenge in February to a judgment that greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide endanger the health of Americans. At a Feb. 16 press conference, Abbott also said the Environmental Protection Agency, which issued the endangerment finding, "outsourced the scientific basis for its greenhouse gas regulation to a scandal-plagued international organization that cannot be considered objective or trustworthy." We saw his statement in a press release issued that day by Gov. Rick Perry, who attended the news conference with Abbott. We wondered if Abbott's salvo, echoed at an April forum by a delegate for Perry's campaign, accurately captured the EPA’s approach. Some background: The EPA’s finding, issued in December, came out after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that greenhouse gases are air pollutants covered by the federal Clean Air Act and that the agency must determine whether or not emissions of greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles cause or contribute to air pollution which may endanger public health or welfare. The EPA said its scientific conclusions were based on work by three groups: the U.S. Global Climate Research Program, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the National Research Council, which synthesize thousands of studies, conveying a consensus on what scientific literature shows about climate, according to the agency. "No other source of information provides such a comprehensive and in-depth analysis across such a large body of scientific studies, adheres to such a high and exacting standard of peer review, and synthesizes the resulting consensus view of a large body of scientific experts across the world," the agency said. "For these reasons, the (EPA) administrator is placing primary and significant weight on these assessment reports in making her decision on endangerment." The report adds that EPA scientists previously gave "significant input" to the groups. The state’s 38-page petition for the EPA to reconsider its finding says that rather than do its own assessment, the agency's "administrator outsourced the actual scientific study, as well as her required review of the scientific literature necessary to make that assessment." "That is, EPA’s conclusion depended on summaries of existing reports that were provided by third parties," the petition states, "rather than on an analysis that was within EPA’s own quality control." Also, the petition says, the groups that the EPA cites for scientific back-up interweave; two have quoted the third, which is misidentified in Abbott's petition as the United Nations International—it’s actually Intergovernmental—Panel on Climate Change, which we delve into below. First, we tried to ask the EPA about the outsourcing descriptive. Spokeswoman Catherine Milbourn pointed us to an EPA website that calls the science behind greenhouse gas pollution "settled"; it says too the finding drew upon the works of "highly respected, peer-reviewed sources" around the globe plus hundreds of thousands of public comments. So the EPA acknowledges leaning on others' existing research, which it considers tip-top sound. What of the second part of Abbott’s statement--that EPA leaned on a scandal-plagued international organization that cannot be considered objective or trustworthy? He’s referring to the Geneva-based IPCC, which became the leading international body for the assessment of climate change after its formation more than 20 years ago by the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organization to "provide the world with a clear scientific view on the current state of climate change and its potential environmental and socio-economic consequences," the panel says online. In 2007, the panel shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Al Gore, the former vice president with a long interest in global warming. The Norweigan Nobel Committee said the panel created "an ever-broader informed consensus about the connection between human activities and global warming. Thousands of scientists and officials from over 100 countries have collaborated to achieve greater certainty as to the scale of the warming." Its 2007 review of research, cited by the EPA, was its latest look at climate science over all. Another is due in 2014. The Fox News Channel has reported that the panel's "reputation for accuracy and fairness, to a large degree, was responsible for building a consensus around the world that global warming was both real and a potentially devastating phenomenon largely caused by man." Of late, however, the panel has drawn fire, mainly from skeptics that the planet is rapidly heating. The latest outcry emerged after e-mails surfaced last year involving scientists including researchers at the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia in the United Kingdom, many of whom have participated in IPCC work. The e-mail back story (detailed by PolitiFact here): On Nov. 20, more than 1,000 e-mails and 3,000 documents came to light. Dating as far back as March 1996, they include exchanges between scientists indicating shaky practices, intentions to withhold public information and even, in one instance, a desire to punch a critic. Over all, though, the Pew Center on Global Climate Change found the e-mails largely routine and innocuous, writing: "Although a small percentage of the e-mails are impolite and some express animosity toward opponents, when placed into proper context they do not appear to reveal fraud or other scientific misconduct." In December, PolitiFact rated False a statement by Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, saying the hacked e-mails debunked the science behind climate change. At a hearing, Inhofe later asked Lisa Jackson, the EPA’s administrator, about the agency leaning on flawed science from the IPCC. Jackson disagreed the panel was discredited, according to video posted online by C-SPAN. "It’s important to understand that the IPCC is a body, that it follows impartial and open and objective assessments," she said. The state's petition for reconsideration mentions the e-mails, noting that Phil Jones, director of the Anglia-based climate research center, was the lead author of the IPCC's 2007 report's "Summary for Policy Makers," and his research is cited 39 times (in 21 chapters) in the panel's report. The petition says the Anglia center is the primary provider of temperature readings used in the IPCC report. So what? So, the state says, the panel's conclusions are flawed because they rely on data from scientists with an agenda, some of them exposed in the e-mails. "Dr. Jones and his colleagues were far from objective," the petition states. "To the contrary, there is overwhelming evidence of outcome-oriented conduct that severely undermines the objectivity of their scientific research." The petition specifies scientists whose impartiality the attorney general questions. To plumb Abbott's point, we reviewed news and opinion articles about the panel and its 2007 report shared by his office. Some highlights: The report misstates the year by which Himalayan glaciers are expected to melt (an error, for which the panel offered a correction this year, that looks like a typo); incorrectly overstates how much of Holland rests below sea level; doesn't support an assertion that global warming could soon cut rain-fed north African crop production in half; and includes a statement about rain forests in South America shrinking for lack of rain that might not be proving out. Broadly, critics including some American scientists have called for the panel to open its next report to doubts about the science and to scientists who point out uncertainties. Separately, an arm of the United Nations agreed in February to review the panel; a report is expected in August. Achim Steiner, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme's Governing Council, was quoted in The Telegraph newspaper saying the IPCC faced a crisis of public confidence. Amid the hubbub, there's no sign of nations forsaking the panel. Two leading British and American scientists have been among onlookers to stress that nothing has undermined the panel's 2007 conclusion that human activities are almost certainly contributing to global warming. Robert Watson, environment minister for the British government and a former head of the IPCC, was quoted by The Telegraph saying: "It is concerning that these mistakes have appeared in the IPCC report, but there is no doubt the earth’s climate is changing and the only way we can explain those changes is primarily human activity." Ralph Cicerone, president of the National Academies of Science and chairman of the National Research Council, wrote in Science magazine that the exposed e-mails "raised concern about the standards of science and has damaged public trust in what scientists do." Yet his "reading of the vast scientific literature on climate change is that our understanding is undiminished by this incident." Later, Cicerone was quoted telling scientists they need to redouble their efforts to share the implications of climate change with the public. "A lot of what we need to do," he said, "is translate basic information into terms the public can understand." At the same meeting, Jerry North, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University, was quoted saying there "has been no change in the scientific community" in the consensus that global average temperatures have been steadily climbing since the mid-20th century. John Nielson-Gammon, the Texas state climatologist, recently told us he believes about 95 percent of what the panel concludes. "It’s probably as good as it gets in terms of a comprehensive analysis done by scientists of a comprehensive... far-reaching issue," he said. "If you're going to rely on something external, that’s the document to rely upon." Where does all this leave Abbott's statement? True, instead of producing on its own research, the EPA instead relied on the work of three other entities. But calling it "outsourcing" is highly misleading because it suggests the agency was shirking its duties. It wasn't. In choosing to use the work of those agencies, particularly the IPCC, the EPA was relying on a large international group of scientists that has reached consensus from thousands of studies. That's a far more comprehensive review than anything the EPA could have done. Abbott also overreaches saying the panel is scandal-plagued and can't be considered objective or trustworthy. Yes, the stolen e-mails have raised questions about a small number of scientists, but the e-mails have not undercut the validity of the panel's main findings. Bottom line: There's a small bit of truth in Abbott's claim, the part that the EPA is relying on outsiders. But his statement is misleading because he implies the EPA has shirked its duties when in fact it is relying on three groups that have synthesized thousands of scientific studies -- almost certainly far more work than the EPA could ever do itself. And yes, the e-mails have raised questions about the work of a clutch of scientists, but they have not put a significant dent in conclusions reached by the IPCC. We rate Abbott's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03723	"The Social Security disability fund is going belly up in 2016."	true	/ohio/statements/2013/apr/15/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-says-social-security-disability-fu/	You hear it often: Social Security is going broke. What you hear less often is an analysis of Social Security’s components -- its old-age retiree program and its disability program. Sen. Rob Portman discussed both parts during a newsmaker breakfast on April 9 sponsored by Politico, the Washington-based newspaper and website. Portman’s remarks on the disability program could be considered jarring to those who don’t pay close attention, so we thought we’d take a step back to check them out. Portman said, "The Social Security disability fund is going belly up in 2016." And 2016, he noted, is "right around the corner." Portman is correct -- from an accounting standpoint, and as of right now. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the most recent Social Security trustees’ annual report, the Social Security account that disburses monthly disability payments will not only pay out more money in 2016 than it takes in through taxes, but also will spend the last dollar it has in reserve by the end of that year. As budget documents put it, the Disability Insurance, or DI, Trust Fund -- the account that held surpluses and was tapped to help make up any recent shortfall -- will be "exhausted" that year. This is the "disability fund" Portman was referring to. The same fate isn’t expected to hit the other piece of the Social Security pie, Old Age and Survivors Insurance, until 2036 (or 2038 under a different analysis). Disabled workers and their spouses and dependents account for 18 percent of overall Social Security payments, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The coming shortfall will occur because disability payments have exceeded the program’s noninterest income since 2005. This occurred for several reasons, including a liberalization of the Social Security screening process with a 1984 law that made certain non-fatal conditions such as back pain, arthritis and mental illness potential qualifiers; a rise in the program’s income-replacement computation, "which strengthened the incentives for workers to seek benefits," and an increase in the female labor force that expanded the pool of insured workers, according to a 2006 analysis by economists for the National Bureau of Economic Research. The latter provided more tax money but also expanded the pool eligible for benefits. But there is another reason, cited by the CBO last July: the aging of the baby boom generation. "More older people suffer from debilitating conditions; moreover, the program’s qualification standards for older workers are less strict than those for younger workers because older people are assumed to be less able to adapt to new types of work," the CBO reported. It noted that "between calendar years 1996 and 2009—the approximate period during which the baby-boom generation entered their 50s—the share of disabled worker benefits awarded to older workers (age 45 and older) rose from 67 percent to 76 percent." But if payroll tax income to the program is insufficient already, why isn’t the DI program broke now? The answer is that the program still has money left from better days -- held in the Trust Fund in the form of government securities. That makes it still possible to pay 100 percent of all benefits. But in 2016, those savings will be depleted., A few numbers make this clearer. In 2011, the DI program paid out $132.3 billion, including $2.9 billion in administrative expenses. But it only took in $81.9 billion in dedicated payroll taxes and $1.6 billion in income taxes that some beneficiaries must pay (depending on their incomes). To make up the rest, it tapped the Trust Fund. It will not be able to do that and pay full expected benefits in 2016. From a practical standpoint, Congress and the White House are likely to act before then. A number of proposals provide ways to avoid a retiree and disabled-worker calamity, some with changes to the payroll tax, some with benefit cuts, some with both. That makes the odds slim that Social Security’s disability fund will actually go broke. But until that happens, all anybody has are the projections. And they are clear. So is this doomsday for Social Security? Not at all. Social Security will still take in enough money to pay a percentage of the claims. Although federal law says the Trust Fund must have assets for claims to be paid, Congress can change the law. More likely is a broader fix from Congress. Portman recognizes this, as he makes clear often -- and did so again at the Politico breakfast -- in his calls for entitlement reform. The Social Security trustees report in 2012 recognized this too, saying, "The DI program faces the most immediate financing shortfall of any of the separate trust funds; thus lawmakers need to act soon to avoid reduced payments to DI beneficiaries four years from now." So yes, we can hope or expect that the problem will be solved before 2016. But as of right now, Portman’s claim -- that the "disability fund is going belly up in 2016" -- is accurate, or as accurate as Social Security’s trustees and the CBO can be. We rate the claim True.

pomt-02712	"A quarter of our workers make $18,000 per year."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2013/dec/23/teresa-ghilarducci/economist-teresa-ghilarducci-says-quarter-us-worke/	Amid growing debate about whether to raise the nation’s $7.25 minimum wage, Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist with the New School in New York City, offered a statistic that sought to gauge how many American workers are poor. "We are No. 1 in the world in creating low-wage jobs," Ghilarducci said on the Dec. 15, 2013, edition of the MSNBC show Up. "One out of four workers in the United States is a low-wage worker, meaning that they make 45 percent of the median wage, which is now $18,000 per year. So a quarter of our workers make $18,000 per year. And no other industrialized country has that kind of record." We wondered if she was correct that "a quarter of our workers make $18,000 per year." We found data from the U.S. Census Bureau that addresses the question. The Census data The Census Bureau data breaks down wage and salaried workers by ranges of income, from "$1 to $2,499" to "$100,000 and up." The data shows that 148.3 million Americans age 15 and up earned some wage or salary income in 2012. Of these workers, 33.5 million earned $17,500 or less. But to square it with Ghilarducci’s income ranges, we need to adjust upwards a bit to account for those earning between $17,500 and $18,000. This adjustment makes the number approximately 35 million. If you divide these 35 million low-income workers by the total 148.3 million workers, the result is 24 percent -- right on target for Ghilarducci’s claim. Some caveats However, we’ll note a few important bits of context. • Part-time workers. As it turns out, the bulk of these 35 million low-income workers -- 23.5 million, or about two-thirds -- worked part time. Now, some percentage of these 23.5 million workers -- perhaps a large percentage, given the slow economic recovery -- is working part time because they want a full-time job but can’t find one. But others may prefer working part time, such as students or parents of young children. When we contacted Ghilarducci, she agreed that this was an issue and forwarded recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggesting that about one-third of part time workers are doing so because they can’t find an acceptable full-time job, while two-thirds are working for non-economic reasons. This suggests that it’s wrong to assume that all, or even most, part-time workers are doing so because of the poor economy. • Partial-year workers. The Census data also tracks how much of the year workers spent on the job. The data shows that 14.8 million people who earned less than $18,000 worked 26 weeks or less. In other words, 42 percent of all workers earning under $18,000 worked for half the year or less. They might have earned well above that if they’d been paid at that rate for the full year. This offers another reminder that it’s wrong to view Ghilarducci’s statistic as suggesting that one-quarter of all workers with a full-time, full-year job are making $18,000 or less. An alternative number So let’s take a look at just the workers who had a full-time job and worked all year. The Census data shows that 98.3 million workers had full-time jobs for the whole year. Of those, about 8.8 million earned $18,000 or less -- just shy of 9 percent. Is this a better number? Not necessarily -- both have merit, and both are imperfect. Ghilarducci’s one-quarter overestimates the number of low-income workers because it includes Americans working part-time voluntarily, or who, by choice or not, may have worked for only for a part of the year. At the same time, the alternative number -- 9 percent -- does the reverse, underestimating the number of low-income workers by not including Americans who are working part-time jobs when they would actually like to have a full-time job. Ghilarducci thanked PunditFact for checking up on her work. "It is important for yakkers on TV to footnote!" she said. "I think I will change my behavior and not give interviews without a follow up with footnotes of my own. So you saved me work. Thank you." Our ruling Ghilarducci said that "a quarter of our workers make $18,000 per year." Census data backs up this top-line number, but beneath the surface, there are reasons for caution. The number she cites does not refer exclusively to full-year, full-time jobs. Rather, it includes lots of people who had a low income because they worked in a part-time job, or worked for just part of the year. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	Teresa Ghilarducci	None	None	None	2013-12-23T10:00:18	2013-12-15	['None']
pomt-05647	"However, it took $19.5 million in Oregon Lottery funds for the Port of Newport to eventually land the new NOAA Marine Operations Center-Pacific."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2012/mar/21/oregon-lottery/did-it-really-take-oregon-lottery-money-land-noaa-/	One way the Oregon Lottery pitches itself is by talking about all the money it brings to economic development projects around the state: a brewery in Astoria, a new home for nonprofit Mercy Flights, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration facility in Newport. From the Lottery’s website: "Newport gave its all when competing with several other sites to bring the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to town. However, it took $19.5 million in Oregon Lottery® funds for the Port of Newport to eventually land the new NOAA Marine Operations Center-Pacific … " That raised the eyebrow of a sharp-eyed reader, and ours, too. The facility was a huge deal for Newport and for Oregon, allowing us to best the Puget Sound for a coveted federal facility that means jobs and bragging rights. (We took it away from Seattle.) But is it fair for the Lottery to claim unbridled credit for this wonderful new economic activity? The state’s main economic development arm, Business Oregon, seems to think so. Its website says the Port of Newport was able to make the winning pitch "largely because of $19.5 million in Oregon Lottery funds, appropriated by the state Legislature, which allowed it to offer a 20-year lease for only $2.4 million per year." Specifically, Lottery revenue bonds were sold to help finance construction of the new Pacific Coast operations center and base; $19.5 million of the total bond sale was earmarked for the Port of Newport. A news report in The Oregonian at the time confirmed that Newport officials called state Sen. Betsy Johnson, D-Scappoose, to help score lottery funds for the deal: "Six months later, they laugh at the memory because, as crazy as it seemed, Johnson and the rest of the caucus bought into the port's dream, and despite the worst economy imaginable, secured $19.5 million in lottery funds to help build a new facility for NOAA, should it agree to come. And agree it did, as the port learned Tuesday." Newport was one of four bidders with the other three in Washington, specifically Seattle, Port Angeles and Bellingham. NOAA awarded the Port of Newport the lease because it had the "highest technically-rated and lowest-priced offer." We called Johnson and asked for her take on the Lottery statement. Her response? "It’s accurate on one level, but it is not very nuanced," she said. She credits a whole bunch of factors for the winning bid, including the members of the legislative "coastal caucus" who put aside differences to push for Newport; legislative leaders who made the money a priority; the Lincoln County delegation, which refused to quit lobbying; and the people in Astoria, who gave up their NOAA bid so the federal delegation could get behind one Oregon bid. "Absent that $19.5 million I don’t think Newport would have shown as well as it did," Johnson said, but she added, it’s not as if the Lottery woke up one morning and decided, "Sheesh, we can make a difference." Certainly officials in Washington said they could not compete with the financing offered by Oregon. The Seattle Times reported in December 2009 that the lease in Bellingham would have cost NOAA $4 million a year and the lease at Lake Union cost nearly $6 million, compared to $2.4 million a year at Newport. But let’s not forget that Newport beat the other sites on technical factors, too. Chuck Baumann, spokesman for the Oregon Lottery, acknowledges lots of factors were at play, but that lottery money was critical for a low-cost lease. "We’re certainly not saying we made the decision," he said. "But it’s also important for us to tell folks where lottery dollars go." The money was critical. NOAA itself says Newport had the lowest cost bid, and that was in large part due to the Lottery. But Johnson is correct that many other factors played a role and for the Lottery to suggest that its money was the final piece is incomplete. The statement is partially accurate -- Lottery money made the lease competitive -- but it leaves out important details. Astoria dropped out; Newport’s bid was better on technical fronts than the others; legislative leaders pulled together to set aside the dollars and bonding authority. We rule the statement Half True.

I told you what my position was, and what I did as governor, the fact that I received the endorsement of the NRA."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/31/mitt-romney/even-he-admits-its-not-true/	Mitt Romney had his flip-flop feet held to the fire by Meet the Press host Tim Russert on Dec. 16, 2007, and made this statement claiming he was endorsed by the National Rifle Association during his 2002 campaign for Massachusetts governor. But he wasn't. The Washington Post picked up on the error that day and posted on its blog "The Trail." The story included a backpedaling quote from the Romney campaign. "The NRA did not endorse in the 2002 campaign," spokesman Kevin Madden said in the Post blog. A couple of days later, Romney campaign spokesman Kristy Campbell elaborated to PolitiFact: "They did not officially endorse, but there had been folks doing supportive phone banking for him." We called the NRA several days in a row seeking comment and confirmation of Campbell's statement about phone banking. Despite promising to call PolitiFact back, no one did. And we could find no independent verification. We did find something funny: Turns out the NRA endorsed a Romney for public office, just not Mitt. Ronna Romney, divorced from Gov. Romney's brother Scott, earned the NRA's support in 1996 as she campaigned for a U.S. Senate seat representing Michigan. She won the primary, but lost to incumbent Sen. Carl Levin.

pomt-13475	North Carolina’s coast "is possibly the best place in (the) U.S. for an offshore windfarm."	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/sep/09/duane-hall/north-carolina-top-state-offshore-wind-power-state/	Some lawmakers want to ban wind turbines from much of North Carolina’s soil, citing concerns about interference with the flight paths of military and civilian aircraft. The N.C. Senate approved regulations in June to do just that. The House of Representatives didn’t vote on the regulations. But regardless of whether they are revived and become law in future legislative sessions, some Democrats are already touting opportunities for wind power that aren’t on land. "NC's coast is possibly the best place in U.S. for an offshore windfarm," Rep. Duane Hall of Raleigh tweeted in August, responding to news of an offshore wind farm being built in Rhode Island. "We need to do this!" Beachgoers tend to hate the winds that stir up sand and send umbrellas tumbling away. But we wondered whether the energy industry views windy days at the North Carolina coast differently, or whether Hall’s claim was nothing but hot air. Energy potential First, we need to ask whether Hall’s claim is even relevant. It wouldn’t matter how good North Carolina’s potential for offshore wind power is compared with the rest of the country if no one is seriously interested in offshore wind power. Even though it’s a new industry in the U.S., it makes sense for wind power advocates to focus offshore. Winds tend to be stronger and more uniform over water than over land. Several offshore wind farms are in various stages of development, and the federal government wants 20 percent of the country’s power to come from wind by 2030. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, "offshore wind is a crucial renewable resource to be incorporated in the country's clean energy mix" because 80 percent of energy use is in coastal states. The federal Bureau of Ocean Energy management has identified three developable sites off the North Carolina coast that contain up to 3,740 megawatts of wind energy potential. That’s nearly twice as much as the solar energy North Carolina produced in 2015, when it ranked third in the nation in solar output. So the potential is there. But is it the best? The best states for wind Hall didn’t respond to our questions asking for evidence backing up his claim. So we looked up various maps and charts on our own, trying to find "possibly the best place" for offshore wind energy. A 2010 study by the federal government’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory measured offshore wind power potential in each state. North Carolina ranked fifth behind Hawaii, California, Michigan and Louisiana. Here's a map from the lab: The study measured total wind power and did not factor how much space would be realistically unusable due to developmental or environmental issues. But taking reality into consideration, Cristina Archer, a University of Delaware professor who studies renewable energy, said North Carolina is "a pretty awesome state for offshore wind." While it doesn’t have the most total wind or the highest wind speeds, she said, North Carolina might have the best actual potential due to the geography of the coast. "I would agree that it is possibly the best in the country, because of the ideal combination of high winds, relatively shallow waters, and a long coastline," Archer said. "Other states, like California, might have higher winds, but the waters are too deep. Or Massachusetts is windier and shallow too, but it does not have the long coastline." The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management agrees: "Wind speeds off the Atlantic Coast and in the Gulf of Mexico are lower than wind speeds off the Pacific Coast. However, the presence of shallower waters in the Atlantic makes development more attractive and economical for now." Factors against North Carolina There are a few reasons why North Carolina might be passed over, however. While North Carolina has more total offshore wind potential than any other East Coast state, some spots in New England have stronger winds. Hurricanes could also scare off some companies. Turbines can only handle winds up to certain strengths, and very fast winds can damage or destroy them. A 2012 study of the risk of hurricane damage in four counties with appealing offshore wind prospects – one each in North Carolina, Texas, New Jersey and Massachusetts – found that the second-riskiest was Dare County, in northeastern North Carolina. The silver lining is that most of the risk in Dare County would be from category 4 and 5 hurricanes. No storm that strong has hit Dare County since at least 1851, when hurricane tracking began. North Carolina as a whole has experienced only one storm that strong – Hurricane Hazel, with category 4 winds, hit southern North Carolina in 1954. Ocean auctions None of the pros or cons matter, however, if companies can’t access the swaths of ocean where they want to build wind farms. The only way to get that access is to lease it from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management at auction. The BOEM has identified three areas in North Carolina for auction – one in Dare County, near Kitty Hawk, and two near Wilmington. The only other such sites in the U.S. are in New York, South Carolina, Hawaii and Oregon. A BOEM spokeswoman said the two Wilmington areas won’t be put up for auction for some time, since they’re being combined with the South Carolina areas. The Kitty Hawk site could be auctioned next year. Our ruling Hall said North Carolina’s coast is "possibly the best place" in the country for offshore wind. We appreciate Hall’s use of the word "possibly." He’s right to acknowledge some uncertainty. North Carolina has neither the country’s best individual spots for wind power nor the most total potential. But it’s near the top and further benefits from a uniquely long, shallow and uniformly windy coastline that gives it competitive advantages. Since Hall’s claim is accurate but needs additional explanation, we rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/52e75965-891a-4094-b1ea-aa5a0ddf548b	None	Duane Hall	None	None	None	2016-09-09T17:34:23	2016-08-23	['United_States']
pomt-12802	"Before the Affordable Care Act, (West Virginia’s) uninsured rate for people 64 to 19 was 29 percent. Today, it is 9 percent."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/14/bernie-sanders/wva-uninsured-rate-has-declined-not-fast-bernie-sa/	Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., had been planning to have a town hall with MSNBC’s Chris Hayes and residents of McDowell County, W.Va., on Feb. 13, 2017, until the West Virginia National Guard told them they could not use a local armory for the event. Sanders instead appeared on Hayes’ show by satellite from the U.S. Capitol, still tailoring his comments to West Virginia. Sanders: "And one of the ironies, Chris, is that one of the states that has benefited the most from Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, is West Virginia." Hayes: "Yes." Sanders: "Before the Affordable Care Act, their uninsured rate for people 64 to 19 was 29 percent. Today, it is 9 percent." Is that correct? Sanders’ office pointed to one government number to support its point. Another government number we found showed a less dramatic decline, but it doesn't change the thrust of his overall point. Let’s crunch the numbers. We’ll start by noting that the age range Sanders cited make some sense. The mandatory Medicare program kicks in at age 65, and enhanced access for children to government health programs tends to produce higher insurance coverage rates for kids than for adults. Sanders’ office pointed to an article in the Charleston (W.Va.) Gazette-Mail that touted the state had the country’s "biggest decline" in the uninsured rate. The article points to data from the National Health Interview Survey, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study found that between 2013 and 2015, West Virginia’s uninsured rate for persons between 18 and 64 fell from 28.8 percent to 8.9 percent. That supports Sanders’ point. (We won’t quibble about Sanders citing an age range that was off by one year.) However, the same report provides an important caveat. It notes that for several states — including West Virginia — the data was "not statistically significant due to larger standard errors." It turns out that some states in the CDC study don’t have enough people sampled to provide robust data. "This would be especially important for a small, low-population state like West Virginia," said Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush and remains a health care policy analyst.. So is there a better number? Yes, specifically, data from the Current Population Survey’s Annual Social and Economic Supplement. This data set, published by the U.S. Census Bureau, asks questions every year on a battery of topics, including health insurance coverage. The database includes figures broken down by state and age category. We looked at West Virginia’s figures for the uninsured population below 65 and subtracted the uninsured population below 18. Here’s what we found. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com This data backs up Sanders’ most recent uninsured rate for West Virginia. But instead of 29 percent, it shows the state’s uninsured rate hovered around 21 percent between 2008 and 2013. Wilensky said she’s not surprised to see such a wide difference between the two data sets, given the methodological differences. She added that the decline in West Virginia’s uninsured rate is still notable and was made possible by the Medicare expansion provision of the Affordable Care Act. "West Virginia’s level of uninsurance would be on the higher side to begin with since they are a poor state," she said. "Since they took advantage of the Medicaid expansion, the big decline is not surprising." Our ruling Sanders said, "Before the Affordable Care Act, (West Virginia’s) uninsured rate for people 64 to 19 was 29 percent. Today, it is 9 percent." Sanders pointed to one federal measurement, though it has methodological problems when drilling down to the statistics for smaller states. A more reliable data set for West Virginia’s case showed a decline from 21 percent to 9 percent. The decline was not as dramatic as he’d indicated, but it was still a significant one.

pomt-12655	Says President Donald Trump’s proposal to allow Americans to buy health insurance across state lines would make it the same as "the way you buy car insurance" today.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/23/mike-pence/discussing-health-care-mike-pence-wrong-about/	During the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump promised to allow Americans to buy health insurance across state lines. The idea is not new, but it’s never been fully enacted. Currently, health insurance is regulated state by state. Some Republicans have long argued that such state-by-state regulation, including minimum requirements for health insurance plans, has kept the price of premiums high. They argue that a more unfettered, free-market approach -- where insurers compete to sell identical policies anywhere, regardless of what the purchaser’s state requires -- would drive down the cost of coverage for consumers. Critics counter that effectively getting rid of state regulation of insurance coverage within their borders would weaken consumer protections and promote a "race to the bottom" in the quality of coverage. (Here are some articles that discuss the pluses and minuses of the approach.) A provision to do what Trump promised didn’t make it into the American Health Care Act, the House Republican bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. However, Trump reiterated his support for the proposal in future legislation -- and his allies have kept up the rhetoric. During a March 19 appearance at the Church by the Glades in Coral Springs, Fla., Vice President Mike Pence said, "Under President Trump’s leadership ... we're going to give the American people the freedom to buy health insurance across state lines -- the way you buy life insurance, the way you buy car insurance." Pence made a similar remark eight days earlier while visiting Kentucky. And on March 14, White House spokesman Sean Spicer reiterated the theme at his daily briefing. "Who could be against allowing insurance to be sold over state lines?" Spicer said. "It’s something that you can do (for) your car insurance." One PolitiFact reader wrote to ask whether the comparison of health insurance and car insurance was accurate, so we decided to take a look. We found that their analogy is flawed. Contrary to what Pence and Spicer said, the rules governing the sale of car insurance are much the same as how health insurance is sold today -- not how the Trump administration wants it to be sold tomorrow. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry.) Currently, states have laws that set minimum standards for both health insurance and car insurance. For instance, when you buy car insurance, you may be required to pay for policies with a minimum level of liability coverage, medical coverage, property damage coverage and coverage for other drivers in an accident who are uninsured or underinsured. (Here’s an interactive tool from Geico to see the particular requirements in your state.) So it’s common for consumers to buy an auto insurance policy online from an out-of-state vendor -- just as they can buy a health insurance policy from a vendor whose headquarters are out of state. The key factor, though, is that for both types of insurance, that out-of-state vendor has to tailor the plan it sells you to the laws of your state. Today, if you live in Maryland, you can purchase an auto policy from Progressive, which is based in Ohio. But the policy you buy from Progressive must adhere to the minimum requirements of your home state, Maryland. It can’t simply sell you a one-state-fits-all policy. That’s effectively the same setup as it is for health insurance. If you are living in Maryland but decide to buy a health insurance policy from Aetna -- a company headquartered in Connecticut -- that plan must conform to Maryland’s minimum requirements. In reality, then, Pence got it backwards. What the Trump administration wants to do would make buying health insurance unlike the way you buy car insurance today -- not more like it, as Pence had said. "Auto insurance is regulated by the states, which have different laws and regulations," said Roger Feldman, a professor of health policy and management at the University of Minnesota. "It doesn't matter from whom I buy my policy -- all auto insurers that sell policies in Minnesota must live by the Minnesota laws." Feldman called the formulation by Pence and Spicer a "false analogy." Lynne McChristian, executive director of the Center for Risk Management, Education and Research at Florida State University, agreed. In fact, she said, "if you buy your health policy today and move from one state to another, when you notify the insurer of the change of address, the policy changes according to the requirements of the new state of residence -- just like auto insurance would." Our ruling Pence said that Trump’s proposal to allow Americans to buy health insurance across state lines would make it the same as "the way you buy car insurance" today. Experts say this analogy is deeply flawed. Contrary to what Pence suggested, today’s rules for car insurance are not a free-market, borderless nirvana. Car insurance is just as regulated, on a state-by-state basis, as health insurance is. So using today’s car-insurance system as a model for the administration’s vision of cross-border health-insurance sales is wrong. Making the change Trump wants would actually make the rules for health insurance and car insurance different -- not the same. We rate the statement False.

pomt-06221	"Most of, if not all of, the [DeKalb school construction] projects always came in on or were under budget."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/dec/06/thomas-brown/were-dekalb-construction-projects-completed-under-/	DeKalb County Sheriff Thomas Brown recently took to the microphone at a few radio stations to talk about education. Surprised? We were. And so we continued to listen. Brown was on the airwaves before the Nov. 8 elections to encourage DeKalb residents to vote for continuing a 1 percent sales tax to fund education construction projects. The sheriff explained his interest in the topic. A large number of the inmates in the county jail don’t have high school diplomas, and it costs about $50 a day to house and feed them. Brown then made a claim that had us reaching for the Truth-O-Meter. "Most of, if not all of, the projects always came in on or were under budget," the sheriff told V-103 during the popular Frank & Wanda morning show the day before the election. Brown repeated similar versions of that claim on other radio programs that day. Ballot initiatives on education spending usually pass with ease, but this was no sure thing. Several former DeKalb school officials, including former Superintendent Crawford Lewis, are awaiting trial on corruption charges. Despite that dark cloud, about 60 percent of DeKalb residents voted to continue the tax. We still wondered whether the sheriff deserved high marks for his claim or was he wrong. Walter Woods, the communications director for the DeKalb County School System, gave us a spreadsheet with 134 projects that have been funded by the latest version of the tax, called the SPLOST III Capital Improvement Program. The program has a budget of about $513 million. Most of the projects under SPLOST III are scheduled to be completed by June 2012. Of those projects, 103 have been completed. Many of the completed projects were for work such as security lighting or carpet replacement. We didn’t consider them as construction projects. We examined projects such as roof replacements (which often cost hundreds of thousands of dollars), renovations and work to comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act. About 85 percent of those projects were done on or under budget. Some of the projects that exceeded the initial cost doubled the earlier budget. They included the track and tennis court at Chapel Hill Middle School, which had an original budget of $125,000 and have a current contract of $255,522. Another was the natatorium work at Lakeside High School, which had an original budget of $150,000 and now has a current contract of $288,506. Others went slightly over budget, such as ceiling, lighting and air conditioning work at Fairington Elementary School, which had an original budget of $1,917,131 and has a current contract of $1,947,809. Many of the projects that were done below the original budget came in 30 percent to 50 percent below costs. Lynn Deutsch, a DeKalb parent who closely watches how the school district spends its money, believes the Great Recession, which took hold in the latter months of 2008, has caused construction costs to drop, which is why most of the projects completed have come in on or under budget. "Things got cheaper," she said. Ken Simonson, chief economist of the Associated General Contractors of America, told us that construction costs dipped after the recession and have since gradually increased. Simonson, however, said the decline in construction work across the country has prompted more companies to bid on government projects, thus driving down bids and the cost of the work. The association represents more than 33,000 firms and started in 1918. Simonson gave us a chart that shows prices for new school construction increased nearly 12 percent in 2008 and dropped nearly 3 percent the year after. The data came from the federal government’s Producer Price Index. Woods said the district has not seen an uptick in costs for materials during the past 18 months. He did say bids by construction companies for DeKalb district work have been lower. "Vendors are more competitive," he said. "I think there’s not a lot of work out there." Minutes from a March 2009 meeting of the SPLOST citizen’s advisory committee make a reference to "favorable construction prices." The minutes were shared by Ernest Brown, a former co-chairman of the committee. Ernest Brown, no relation to the sheriff, recalled discussions about the recession’s impact on construction bids. "It drove down labor costs because people were being more competitive, and it saved money for the taxpayers," he said. Woods also defended the quality of the work, which has been a concern of some DeKalb parents who closely watch the district’s spending. He did say some subcontractors have been late in meeting deadlines. The DeKalb school district’s spreadsheet and what we saw ourselves backs up much of Thomas Brown’s argument. The recession has apparently helped lower bid prices -- even though a few projects were still seriously over budget. We rate Brown’s claim as Mostly True.

pomt-03380	Electricity rates are 40 percent higher in states that have required utility companies to use a certain amount of renewable energy such as solar power.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/jul/10/americans-prosperity-georgia-chapter/group-wants-georgia-block-solar-requirement/	A recent email blast has sparked one of the hottest political debates in Georgia this summer. Americans for Prosperity’s Georgia chapter contacted its 50,000 members on July 1, warning them that the state’s Public Service Commission was preparing this month to make some major changes that would force Georgians to reach deeper into their wallets. "What if I told you something you're not even hearing about in the news is about to raise your electricity bill by more than 40 percent and reduce the reliability of every appliance and electronics gadget in your home?" the organization’s state director, Virginia Galloway, wrote in the beginning of her email. How could this happen? The PSC is scheduled to vote Thursday on whether to require that Georgia Power increase the use of solar energy in its long-term plan. States with such a mandate have electricity bills that are 40 percent more than those that do not, the group says. Not true, others say. Gwinnett County resident Debbie Dooley, a proponent of the plan who is the national coordinator of the Tea Party Patriots, was quoted as saying Galloway was using outdated information to base her claim about the potential 40 percent increase. A PSC member made a similar argument. So who’s right here? PolitiFact Georgia sought to find out. Solar energy has generated a battle among many conservatives. Some say the use of renewable energy such as solar power has created more jobs. They also don’t want states to be dependent on one or two energy sources. Others object to the idea of forcing the marketplace to use renewable energy. They also contend some energy resources are too expensive. Galloway’s email, which she shared with us, contained a state-by-state chart of electricity rates put together by the Institute for Energy Research, a Washington-based nonprofit organization that evaluates public policy initiatives on oil, coal, wind and solar energy. Many members of its staff have worked for Republicans on Capitol Hill. A blog on its website criticized President Barack Obama’s recent speech on climate control. In early 2010, the institute published a 191-page report on energy regulation. The report examined "renewable portfolio standards," a term used to describe how states require or encourage electricity producers to supply some of their electricity from designated renewable resources such as wind or solar energy. Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia had some form of RPS guidelines, according to industry accounts. Georgia, like most Southern states, does not have an RPS policy. The report found "mandating the use of wind and solar through renewable portfolio standards increases electricity costs for consumers." Its chart shows the average price for electricity in states with a binding RPS policy is 39.4 percent higher in all sectors. The prices were based on kilowatt hours in 2009. Galloway also sent us a December report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration showing the average price for operating solar plants that will be active by 2018 will be higher than the costs for coal, natural gas and wind. PSC member Doug Everett told Americans for Prosperity that solar prices have fallen significantly since the institute’s report in 2010. "Some other states have seen dramatic price increases when implementing solar power because they went ahead with projects three or five years ago when solar prices were 70 percent higher than they are today," he said. Solar prices have fallen sharply in the past five years due in large part to global oversupply, according to news reports, industry websites and government reports. The federal government has also invested more money in solar research and development to lower prices. The accounts include: -- a Reuters news service report that solar panel prices fell by 50 percent in 2011. -- a Reuters report that last year, the average price for silicon-based solar panels by top manufacturers fell to $0.7-$0.8 per watt, from around $3.5-$4.5 per watt in 2008. -- a U.S. Department of Energy report that solar energy installation prices dropped by 30 percent between 2008 and 2012. Daniel Simmons, an official with the institute, said via email that rates are driven by policy choices such as renewable mandates. "This is why California's electricity rates are much higher than surrounding states for example," said Simmons, the institute’s director of regulatory and state affairs. "The overall point of our paper was pointing out these policy choices. Renewables mandates are one example of the type of policy choices that drive up electricity rates." An Associated Press report also noted that there may be other factors that contribute to higher rates in states with binding renewable portfolio standards, such as the demand for energy and weather. Again, Americans for Prosperity’s Georgia chapter claimed in an email that electricity rates are 40 percent higher in states that have required utility companies to use a certain amount of renewable energy such as solar power. The chapter does not want Georgia to enact the same guidelines here. The claim is based on a study that appears accurate. But there is widespread news coverage that solar prices have fallen significantly in the past five years. It may be premature to make a correlation between the solar market and electricity prices. The chapter’s claim is based on accurate data, but it’s missing some important details. We rate it Half True. Editor's Note: This article includes updated information from an Associated Press report. The rating remained the same.	None	Americans for Prosperity Georgia chapter	None	None	None	2013-07-10T00:00:00	2013-07-01	['None']
pomt-14207	Says that in her speech to the pro-Israel group AIPAC, Hillary Clinton "had one line on the Palestinian people."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/20/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-hillary-clinton-had-one-line-p/	On ABC’s This Week, host George Stephanopoulos asked Bernie Sanders about his remark during the New York Democratic debate that the United States should play "an evenhanded role" with regard to Israel and its neighbors. Sanders told Stephanopoulos that he thinks President Barack Obama has "done much better than his predecessors" in taking the kind of approach he prefers, but added that "I think we still have a way to go. And I was not criticizing President Obama. I was criticizing (former Secretary of State Hillary) Clinton. She gave a speech to AIPAC" -- referring to the most prominent pro-Israel group in the United States. "It's a long speech. It was one sentence, I believe, that even mentioned the Palestinians." While Sanders went on to say that "it goes without saying" that "we have to protect 100 percent Israel's right to exist, its right to live in peace, its right to live in security," he added that "you cannot ignore the suffering of the Palestinian people." When Stephanopoulos asked whether he thought Clinton has ignored the suffering of the Palestinian people, Sanders reiterated that her AIPAC speech had "one line on the Palestinian people." We wondered whether Sanders’ was right that Clinton "had one line on the Palestinian people" in her AIPAC speech. So we looked closely at her address. The most obvious way to look at this is to count the number of references to the Palestinians in Clinton’s speech and see if they amount to more than one line. Sanders is wrong by that simple metric, as we’ll show. But to broaden our look somewhat, we also analyzed more generally how much of Clinton’s speech addressed the Israeli-Palestinian peace process as opposed to how much it addressed Israel’s security needs. What Clinton said about the Palestinians Here is the main section of her AIPAC speech -- which she gave on March 21 -- that addressed Palestinians. The sentences that mentioned the Palestinians by name are in bold. And here is a third choice. Will we keep working toward a negotiated peace or lose forever the goal of two states for two peoples? Despite many setbacks, I remain convinced that peace with security is possible and that it is the only way to guarantee Israel’s long-term survival as a strong Jewish and democratic state. It may be difficult to imagine progress in this current climate when many Israelis doubt that a willing and capable partner for peace even exists. But inaction cannot be an option. Israelis deserve a secure homeland for the Jewish people. Palestinians should be able to govern themselves in their own state, in peace and dignity. And only a negotiated two-state agreement can survive those outcomes. If we look at the broader regional context, converging interests between Israel and key Arab states could make it possible to promote progress on the Israeli-Palestinian issue. Israelis and Palestinians could contribute toward greater cooperation between Israel and Arabs. I know how hard all of this is. I remember what it took just to convene Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas for the three sessions of direct face-to-face talks in 2010 that I presided over. But Israelis and Palestinians cannot give up on the hope of peace. That will only make it harder later. All of us need to look for opportunities to create the conditions for progress, including by taking positive actions that can rebuild trust — like the recent constructive meetings between the Israeli and Palestinian finance ministers aiming to help bolster the Palestinian economy, or the daily on-the-ground security cooperation between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. But at the same time, all of us must condemn actions that set back the cause of peace. Terrorism should never be encouraged or celebrated, and children should not be taught to hate in schools. That poisons the future. Everyone has to do their part by avoiding damaging actions, including with respect to settlements. Now, America has an important role to play in supporting peace efforts. And as president, I would continue the pursuit of direct negotiations. And let me be clear — I would vigorously oppose any attempt by outside parties to impose a solution, including by the U.N. Security Council. This section includes the word "Palestinian" or a variant seven times, over the course of five sentences. So Sanders is wrong that Clinton "had one line on the Palestinian people." She had -- using the strictest definition possible -- five lines. Mentions of the peace process vs. mentions of Israeli security Looking more broadly at the content of Clinton’s speech doesn’t do much to support Sanders’ claim. Sanders’ point seemed to be that the Palestinians’ interests were being ignored in Clinton’s speech. So we wondered about how much Clinton addressed the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians and how much she talked about the need to preserve Israel’s security. We thought this would be a reasonable proxy for Sanders’ point, since the peace process includes Palestinians as an integral part of the equation, whereas a focus on Israeli security relegates Palestinians’ safety and security to a lower priority. To look at this question, we made an effort to break down Clinton’s 3,316-word speech by theme. Our choices aren’t unassailable -- some portions of the speech address more than one topic, and different readers may choose to label different sections differently -- but we think it’s pretty good as a rough categorization of what she said. We settled on five categories. Here they are, along with the number of words we counted for each of those themes: • Preliminary remarks: 238 • Comments about the U.S.-Israel relationship and Clinton’s priorities: 1,148 • Comments about Israel's security: 762 • Comments on Iran or ISIS: 795 • Comments urging the peace process forward (the portion excerpted above): 373 •Total: 3,316 To get a better grasp of this breakdown visually, here’s what her speech looks like by theme. The green section indicates preliminary remarks, the purple denotes U.S.-Israel relations, the gray refers to Iran and ISIS, the light blue denotes Israeli security, and the yellow refers to the peace process. So by our count, more than 10 percent of Clinton’s comments addressed the peace process, which, as we noted, inherently involves the Palestinians. And if you strip out the preliminaries, the comments on the U.S.-Israel relationship and the comments on Iran and ISIS, the ratio becomes even less favorable to Sanders' point. Comparing just Clinton’s Israeli security comments to her peace-process comments, she spent twice as many words on Israeli security as on the peace process. That’s an imbalance, especially if your goal is "evenhandedness." But the imbalance is much more modest than Sanders’ "one line" comment would indicate. Our ruling Sanders said that in her AIPAC speech, Clinton "had one line on the Palestinian people." She actually had more lines than that -- seven mentions of the word "Palestinian" in five sentences. And overall, she spent about 10 percent of her speech talking about the peace process, of which Palestinians are an integral part. That’s still an imbalance -- Clinton spent twice as many words discussing Israeli security -- but Sanders’ assertion is still a significant exaggeration. We rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5a0ad4a2-f5e6-4773-bae5-dc2134a9537a	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2016-04-20T11:55:49	2016-04-17	['American_Israel_Public_Affairs_Committee', 'Hillary_Rodham_Clinton']
pomt-13513	"As the election tracker FiveThirtyEight has reported, whoever wins Pennsylvania will be our next President."	mostly false	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/sep/02/rob-gleason/does-pennsylvania-really-have-power-decide-preside/	Every election, pundits and politicians alike harp on the importance of battleground states, those pockets of uncertainty within the country where less-predictable voting patterns make the outcome a bigger priority for candidates. In 2016, Pennsylvania is one of them. But do voters here bear ultimate responsibility for who is next Commander in Chief? An August 29 fundraising email from Republican Party of Pennsylvania Chairman Rob Gleason says yes. Because a new poll (not cited) showed Donald Trump to be "within striking distance" of Hillary Clinton, according to the email, now was a time to donate because FiveThirtyEight reported that the winner of Pennsylvania would win the election. The last statement bears a closer examination. Nate Silver’s nationally-renowned prognostication site FiveThirtyEight reports all kinds of statistical analysis in order to predict elections (and it’s gotten the last two right.) Naturally, with Pennsylvania as a battleground state, FiveThirtyEight has done a fair bit of reporting on its possible outcomes, as well as how much power it actually could have. The way FiveThirtyEight figures this out is by determining states’ "tipping power" ― that is, the probability that Pennsylvania, for example, will provide the deciding electoral college vote. This is determined by organizing states from most likely to least likely to vote Republican, or the same for Democrats, and finding which state will provide which candidate the 270th electoral vote needed to win (the majority of the 538 available electoral votes.) Naturally, the dialogue has evolved as the election has gotten closer, and so FiveThirtyEight’s certainty in predicting Pennsylvania to be that state with the most tipping power has also varied. In recent elections, the states that have always been the most contested were Ohio, Florida, North Carolina or Michigan. Pennsylvania is so hotly debated this year because its voting patterns have become increasingly split ― even though the Philadelphia metro area and its suburbs form a pretty solid blue voting bloc, Western Pennsylvania and other parts of the state have trended more Republican in recent elections. When asked for comment, Aaron Bycoffe pointed us to a May article about the topic, but again, the headline reads "Why Pennsylvania Could Decide The 2016 Election." Could. Not will. And that’s an important difference. FiveThirtyEight has dedicated plenty of coverage this year to analyzing Pennsylvania’s importance, and the site also has a regularly updated election tracker that includes a list ranking the states with the most tipping power. Currently, Pennsylvania is listed second only to Florida, but the advantage the latter has is 5.7 percentage points, which is a pretty commanding lead compared to the margins of difference between, say, Pennsylvania and the third-likely state, Ohio. Pennsylvania is edging out Ohio in tipping power by just 0.5 percent. Those numbers all still have plenty of time to change before the November election. When asked to clarify the claim, the Pennsylvania GOP referred to the reports that have most confidently handed Pennsylvania tipping power. Rather than numbers, they’ve mostly been commentary from staff, like this chat between several editors and a senior politics writer, a couple of whom answer Pennsylvania to the final question of which state will tip the election. Dave Wasserman, who writes for the Cook Political Report, also penned a piece touting the importance of the state and its increased likelihood to determine the winner. But the staff chat was in early June, and Wasserman published his piece in May. The election tracker is updated at least daily. Our ruling It’s true that at various points in its coverage, FiveThirtyEight strongly emphasized Pennsylvania’s potential to be the deciding vote. However, saying that it flat-out declared the Pennsylvania winner the automatic winner of the presidency is still misleading. For one thing, FiveThirtyEight itself reports predictive statistical analysis ― which is never going to produce such a definitive answer about a swing state’s power. FiveThirtyEight also makes a point of explaining in its election forecast user guide that fluctuations in polling data, which it uses to determine things like tipping power, have more meaning later in the election. So any shifts in the polls (which, given Donald Trump’s lack of predictability as a candidate, are not impossible in this election) could rearrange where that tipping power resides. It’s an effective strategy to stress the importance of a state’s electoral votes in order to get donations and constituencies to vote, but even that should be accurately represented. FiveThirtyEight’s actual election tracker still leaves ambiguity as to Pennsylvania’s ultimate tipping power. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-15385	Says "Hillary Clinton's rejection of efforts to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat not only defies logic, but the will of the majority of Americans."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jun/29/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-most-americans-support-voter-id-/	In Scott Walker and Hillary Clinton's perfect world, at around this time next year each will be preparing to participate in the 2016 presidential debates. For now, they will have to be content exchanging jabs from afar. The latest exchange began June 4, 2015 when Clinton, who is the leading Democratic presidential candidate, criticized Walker and three other GOP contenders in a speech at Texas Southern University in Houston for their support of voter ID laws. She claimed Walker had cut back early voting in Wisconsin and made it harder for college students to vote. We rated that Mostly True. Walker responded to Clinton’s attack with a statement and then through a series of tweets. In his statement, Walker said, "Hillary Clinton's rejection of efforts to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat not only defies logic, but the will of the majority of Americans." Is Walker right that a strong majority of Americans support photo IDs to vote? And do those requirements make it "easier to vote and harder to cheat"? Polls and photo ID The thrust of Walker’s claim was that photo ID laws are exceptionally popular among voters, and that Hillary Clinton’s view opposing them is out of step. So we will start there. According to the polls we examined, Walker is on target about public support. A Rasmussen Reports poll published June 3, 2015, showed 76 percent of respondents believe voters should be required to show a form of photo identification before being allowed to vote. Even 58 percent of respondents who identified as Democrats supported voter ID laws. The poll included 952 likely voters and had a margin of error of 3 percent. A 2012 Washington Post poll found 74 percent of respondents said they believed voters should have to show government-issued ID before casting a ballot. Again, the support crossed demographic groups: 78 percent of white respondents supported voter ID laws; as did 67 percent of non-whites, 65 percent of blacks and 64 percent of Hispanics. The poll included 2,047 adults. The margin of error was 2.5 percent. We looked at several other national polls, and all had similar numbers: between 70 percent and 80 percent of voters support requiring a photo ID to vote. Meanwhile, a 2014 Marquette University Law School poll of 1,409 registered Wisconsin voters found 60 percent of respondents supported requiring a photo ID to vote. The margin of error was 2.7 percent. "It gets overwhelming public support," said Kenneth Mayer, a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. "Depending on which poll, you might get 60 to 80 percent support. "The reason you get that level of support ... most of the people who vote have an accessible voter ID." Easy to vote, hard to cheat There are two other elements embedded in Walker’s claim -- that photo ID laws make it easier to vote and harder to cheat. On these points, there is great partisan disagreement and dug-in views on both sides. Critics of ID laws -- mainly Democrats -- say the amount of voter fraud is small and that the laws can disenfranchise poor and elderly voters who may have difficulty obtaining a photo ID. Supporters note the law includes provisions to address access to IDs and argue that any amount of fraud is too much. "It doesn’t matter if there’s one, 100 or 1,000," Walker said in a 2014 gubernatorial debate. "Amongst us, who would be that one person who would like to have our vote canceled out by a vote that was cast illegally?" In 2011, Walker signed Act 23, the law that requires Wisconsin voters to present a form of photo ID before receiving a ballot. Provisions of the law were quickly challenged in court. Thus the law has only fully in place been for the 2012 spring primary -- a nonpartisan contest that had only eight judicial races on the ballot, plus three local special elections. It has yet to be tested in a statewide race. That will change in 2016, with the spring elections. In March 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear a challenge to the law, meaning it now stands. What changed? Before the 2011 legislation, an already-registered voter had to simply state his or her name and address to a poll worker in order to receive a ballot. Under the new law, a voter must also show an acceptable form of photo ID and sign the poll book before receiving a ballot. When asked for evidence that photo ID laws make it easier to vote, a Walker aide pointed to a modest increase in voter turnout in Wisconsin since the law was passed. But that ignores the many other factors at play in driving turnout, including the candidates on the ballot and how close the race is perceived to be by voters. And, as noted, the law has not yet been fully in place for a statewide election, so to say it increased turnout is a stretch at best. Indeed, some studies, such as one from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, suggest photo ID laws may have contributed to a decrease in voter turnout in some states. In 2012, more than 9 in 10 registered Wisconsin voters were estimated to have a valid form of photo ID. That left around 300,000 registered voters without a photo ID at the time. Mayer, who conducted the estimate, said it is unknown how many unregistered voters may lack the proper documents to obtain a free, state-issued ID. The bottom line: At least some voters will have to go to extra steps to obtain a valid ID. That makes it more difficult to vote, not easier. As for the "harder to cheat" portion, Mayer conceded photo ID laws could be effective against in-person voter fraud. But he and others note that there have been few documented cases of in-person voter fraud. "It makes it harder for kangaroos to vote, but kangaroo voter fraud is not a problem," Mayer said. That argument, though, goes to the whether the law itself was even needed. Walker’s claim was on the impact of the changes. The new law adds an extra verification step at the polling place before votes can be cast. That clearly makes it harder to cheat, as Walker claimed. When it comes to voter fraud, the most common type is voting by felons who are not allowed to vote, said Reid Magney, a public information officer for the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board. A felon is not allowed to vote if he or she is still "on-paper," meaning he or she is on parole, on extended supervision or on probation. Once a felon is "off-paper" he or she can vote again after re-registering. Felon voting has been a problem before in Milwaukee. A Journal Sentinel investigation from 2008 identified "at least 278 cases where felons may have improperly voted." But voter ID laws would not prevent this type of voter fraud; many felons can still get driver's licenses. The state catches illegal felon voters by cross referencing a list of voters to a list of felons "on paper" with the Department of Corrections. Our rating Walker said, "Hillary Clinton's rejection of efforts to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat not only defies logic, but the will of the majority of Americans." Walker is on point with the main thrust of his claim. Polls show strong support for voter ID laws, including from Democrats. The other elements of the claim -- easier to vote and harder to cheat -- amount to a split. It’s clearly not easier to vote if the extra step of obtaining a photo ID is added. Likewise, it is harder to cheat if there is an extra verification step at the polling place. On balance, we rate Walker’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-03366	Says Obama administration delay of health care law's employer mandate affects about 1 percent of the American workforce.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/12/robert-menendez/sen-robert-menendez-says-obamacares-employer-manda/	Just how many workers does the health care law’s employer mandate affect, anyway? The Obama administration’s holiday-week announcement that it would delay requiring large employers to provide full-time employees with affordable coverage inflamed opponents of the law. (And dismayed some supporters, who questioned whether the president had that authority.) But some pointed out that, in any case, the mandate wouldn’t affect many folks. Take Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., on NBC’s Meet the Press on July 7: "96 percent of all companies in America weren't subject to the mandate because they're under 50 employees. Those who are subject to the mandate, 95 percent of them already offer insurance so, we're talking about probably 1 percent of the American workforce that works for a company subject to the mandate that didn't get insurance and will be able to get it in the health exchanges that open up in October." Are we talking about just 1 percent of the American workforce? Employers, employees We asked Menendez’s office for evidence for his claim. A spokeswoman pointed us to a respected employer survey and two opinion pieces. It turns out that "1 percent of the American workforce" is a ballpark calculation based on survey research on the number of employees who work for large firms that don’t offer insurance. Several prominent health economists we spoke with think that’s a pretty reasonable way to estimate it. But some others think it may understate the reach of the mandate by millions. But no one’s sure just how many million. Let us explain. Here’s how the mandate works: Starting in 2014 — now 2015 — employers with more than 50 full-time equivalent employees must offer affordable health coverage. If they don’t offer coverage, or offer coverage that’s too limited or too expensive, they’ll likely end up on the hook for penalties (the government’s calling them "shared responsibility payments") of about $2,000 per full-time employee, excluding the first 30. For the visual learners among you, the independent nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation summarized the mandate in this nifty infographic. The employer mandate’s supposed to work hand-in-hand with the individual mandate that everybody — with a few exceptions — carry health insurance or pay a tax penalty. If employers don’t offer coverage, their workers may seek it out on new insurance exchanges, where they may be eligible for tax credits. The employer penalties are designed to discourage dumping employees onto the exchanges, where they may drive up the cost of government subsidies. Or, barring that, to offset the cost of those subsidies. (The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated in May, before the delay, that the penalties would be worth $10 billion in 2015.) But Menendez argued on Meet the Press that because the mandate applies only to larger companies, most of whom already offer insurance, the number of workers who would have been affected just isn’t all that big. More specifically: about 1 percent of the American workforce. Let’s talk about that calculation for a second. The size of the U.S. labor force, according to the government, is about 156 million. Menendez’s sources estimated the mandate only affects about 1 million or 1.5 million workers — about 1 percent of 156 million. They focused only on the likely number of employees who work for the 5 percent of large firms that don’t offer insurance, based on a widely respected employer survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation. We know because we talked to them: Zeke Emanuel, a bioethicist, and Mark Duggan, a health economist, both scholars at the University of Pennsylvania who have advised the Obama administration. (Emanuel also happens to be the brother of Rahm, the president’s former chief of staff, now mayor of Chicago.) It’s hard to estimate exactly, Duggan said, but if the perhaps 10,000 to 12,000 companies that don’t offer insurance each have about 80 to 100 employees — there you go. It’s in the range of Menendez’s 1 percent. It’s reasonable to assume that most of the companies with more than 50 employees that don’t offer insurance are on the small side, they say, because the Kaiser research shows the larger the size of the firm, the more likely it is to offer insurance. Kaiser itself concludes that in 2012, 95 percent of employers with at least 50 workers offered insurance — and among firms of that size, 98 percent of employees worked for a company that offered coverage to at least some of its workers. Here’s the criticism: What about the uninsured workers who work for companies that offer insurance? Duggan and Emanuel (and others, including Romneycare/Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber at MIT) say most of those folks wouldn’t trigger the mandate, anyway: They’re part-time or temporary workers that companies won’t be required to insure. Other health economists we spoke with said: Not so fast. How do you know? Christopher Conover, who works for the Center for Health Policy and Inequalities Research at Duke University, argues there are millions of uninsured workers who work for companies that offer insurance who may well qualify for employer coverage under Obamacare. He pointed to a recent example in the New York Times of a restaurant that would likely be subject to the employer mandate. The owner offers health coverage to employees, but only to nine of them. It’s a company, then, that offers insurance — and so wouldn’t be part of Duggan’s ballpark calculation. But under the employer mandate, the restaurant owner estimates he would need to insure 22 of his 85 employees. Conover argues any estimate of the number of workers affected by the mandate should include workers like the 13 restaurant employees who are right now left out. They work for a company that offers health insurance, but not to them. Here’s the thing: Economists disagree about how common that situation really is. Are there a million such workers? Five million? More? They don’t know. "It’s a lot more than a million people. It just has to be," said Stephen Parente, a health economist at the University of Minnesota who advised Sen. John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign. Still, experts we talked to agreed that the vast majority of the American workforce are not affected. "I think the bottom line is that it is small," said Gruber of MIT. "Menendez may not be exactly right but he is in the right ballpark." Our ruling Menendez said on Meet the Press that "we're talking about probably 1 percent of the American workforce that works for a company subject to the mandate that didn't get insurance." He cited a ballpark estimate by health economists based on the small number of large employers who don’t offer insurance. Critics of the estimate say that calculation misses uninsured workers for the 95 percent of large employers that do offer insurance. The problem is that no one’s sure how many of those workers would be subject to the mandate — as opposed to part-time or temporary workers who don’t qualify for employer insurance now, and wouldn’t in 2015, either. But that number, even if it's millions more, remains a small percentage of the U.S. workforce. We rate Menendez's claim Mostly True.

pomt-10494	"He positions himself as pro environment, but he scored a zero — yes, zero — from the League of Conservation Voters last year."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/08/moveon/absences-wrecked-his-rating/	The left-leaning organization MoveOn.org targeted Sen. John McCain in an e-mail to supporters, listing "10 things you should know about John McCain (but probably don't)." The list attacks McCain on a host of issues that include his policies, personal wealth and personality. The final item attacks McCain for his record on the environment. "He positions himself as proenvironment, but he scored a zero — yes, zero — from the League of Conservation Voters last year," the e-mail states. McCain says he supports the environment. His campaign Web site brags: "Along with his commitment to clean air and water, and to conserving open space, he has been a leader on the issue of global warming with the courage to call the nation to action on an issue we can no longer afford to ignore." It's also true that the League of Conservation Voters gave McCain a score of zero on its 2007 Congressional scorecard, placing him among eight senators who got doughnuts. But there is a mitigating reason McCain got a zero. Of the 15 votes the league graded, McCain was absent for every vote — yes, every vote. The other bottom-ranking senators actively voted against the league's agenda. Five voted against the league's preferred position on all 15 votes, and two voted against the league's position on 14 votes. To find out if McCain really is the bottom of the barrel on the environment, we called David Jenkins of Republicans for Environmental Protection, who served on the league's scorecard advisory committee. Jenkins said McCain's record on the environment is significantly better than the league's scorecard shows, and his organization endorsed McCain for president in October 2007, during the Republican primary. "If someone wanted to make the case that, as a senator, you should be there for votes, well, you could make that case," Jenkins said. "But to say that it says something about his environmental positions is disingenuous." (We looked at another, similar controversy over using missed votes to rate McCain's environmental record; read that story here .) The Republicans for Environmental Protection does its own scorecard, but McCain didn't do so great on that one, getting only 36 points on a 100 point scale. (The group's rankings are a little more complicated because they also award bonus points for "leadership positions"; it's even possible to receive a score higher than 100.) Despite McCain's low ratings, Jenkins considers him one of the three most reliable Republican senators on environmental issues. (The other two Jenkins named are Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe, both of Maine.) MoveOn's words about McCain's environmental record are literally true — because he's missed so many votes. As we noted in our previous item, his average score with the group between 2001 and 2006 was 44.3, but the e-mail gives the impression that McCain is rock-bottom on environmental issues.

pomt-02396	"As attorney general, I have prosecuted judges, district attorneys and other public officials across Texas who violated that (public) trust, who have been corrupted."	true	/texas/statements/2014/mar/11/greg-abbott/greg-abbotts-office-has-prosecuted-public-official/	Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott drew heat for a Feb. 4 2014, speech in which he likened official corruption scandals in Texas-Mexico border counties to "third-world practices," a comment PolitiFact Texas unpacked in a Feb. 11 In Context article. His comparison drew criticism from lawmakers, the McAllen newspaper and his main opponent in the governor’s race, Democratic state Sen. Wendy Davis, who said, "Abbott even went as far as comparing the Texas border to a third-world country." (Abbott soon after won the Republican gubernatorial nomination in the March 2014 primary.) Responding to such criticism, Abbott said in a Feb. 10 opinion article in the McAllen Monitor that his concerns about corruption expressed in his speech "apply wherever corruption is found." "Public service is a public trust," Abbott wrote. "As attorney general, I have prosecuted judges, district attorneys and other public officials across Texas who violated that trust, who have been corrupted." We were curious about that because the attorney general’s office doesn’t focus on battling violent crime. That’s the purview of local prosecutors and police departments. As the Texas Constitution makes clear, the primary job of the attorney general is representing the state in civil matters. Still, state law permits the attorney general to help prosecute a criminal case if a local prosecutor requests assistance. For such purposes, state lawmakers have allowed the attorney general to employ peace officers and lawyers with backgrounds in criminal prosecution to pitch in on occasion. We asked Abbott’s office for information on the prosecutions he referred to in his commentary. Spokeswoman Lauren Bean emailed us a list of 104 prosecutions handled by the agency since Abbott became attorney general in late 2002. The AG’s office was the lead prosecutor in the vast majority of the cases, she told us by phone. The list included cases involving public officials from dog catcher (a child pornography case that ended in a guilty verdict) through higher city and county officials, tax assessors, sheriffs, justices of the peace, judges, assistant district attorneys and one former district attorney (who pleaded guilty to paying himself and others more than $2 million illegally while in office). Crimes involving child pornography and taking public funds are certainly violations of the public trust, though we also wondered how many of Abbott’s cases involved corruption like the examples he presented in his "third-world" speech: a former state district judge sentenced to six years in prison for his role in a cash-for-favors scheme, a former sheriff’s captain who took bribes from drug traffickers; and law enforcement officials who stole drugs and resold them to dealers. Abbott also noted in his Feb. 10 opinion piece that the Monitor had reported that "cases of public officials on the take have spiked." And, Abbott said, "there have been other stories about law enforcement officers in other Texas counties involved in money laundering, drug smuggling and accepting bribes to protect the cartels and their smuggling routes." Texas Penal Code Chapter 1, Section 1.09, says the attorney general’s office can aid county or district attorneys in prosecuting certain criminal offenses including misuse of state property or funds and abuse of office, according to the office’s website. Public corruption, bribery and abuse of office were specifically cited in some of Abbott’s prosecutions. We set aside those that did not immediately appear to relate to misusing a public office. Deleting DWI cases, child pornography or indecency, murder, assault/injury, sexual offenses and gambling left 61 prosecutions. Eleven of those 61 prosecutions cited theft by a public servant. Others fell into criminal offense categories including bribery, (breach of) public integrity, official oppression, election violations, fraud and abuse of official capacity, as well as misappropriation or misallocation of public funds or property. The type of case in one prosecution involving an assistant county auditor was specifically given as "public corruption." So certainly some of the prosecutions involved what ordinary citizens might regard as corruption. We sought expert advice. Two attorneys suggested it’s not easy to decide when a criminal case involves corruption in office. Director Gregg Cox of the Travis County district attorney’s special prosecutions division, which investigates allegations of wrongdoing by public officials, told us by email, "There is no definition of ‘corruption’ in the Penal Code or Code of Criminal Procedure, and because the way that term is used can differ from office to office, I would just not be comfortable commenting on that." George Dix, a criminal law expert and University of Texas law professor, said via email, "I'm not sure what are 'corruption' cases. As far as I know, that is not a term of art. I suppose the term could mean a prosecution for a crime that requires proof of some official malfeasance." Finally, we looked at whether the prosecutions occurred across Texas, as Abbott wrote, and at whether the prosecuted individuals included judges and district attorneys, as he said. The 104 prosecutions occurred in about one-fourth of Texas’ 254 counties -- six on the border and 193 scattered elsewhere across the state. Nine of Abbott’s public-official prosecutions involved a judge, assistant district attorney, county attorney and district attorney (at the time of his crimes). Four seemed not to be related to abuse of office: a child pornography case, two drunken-driving cases and one case involving misdemeanor offensive contact with an employee. The remaining five prosecutions: State v. David McCoy A Feb. 21, 2008, Amarillo Globe-News news story said, "Suspended 100th District Court Judge David McCoy concluded an agreement with the state Attorney General's office Thursday afternoon that will prevent him from facing felony charges. … A Childress County Grand Jury indicted him on two felony indictments: abuse of official capacity and theft by a public servant." News reports provided no additional detail. State v.

He gets two years probation for taking double reimbursement for travel expenses out of several district and county accounts." State vs. Joe Frank Garza A May 9, 2011, Corpus Christi Caller-Times news story said, "Former 79th District Attorney Joe Frank Garza began serving a six-month stint behind bars on Monday for illegally paying himself and his employees more than $2 million from his office's drug forfeiture fund." In re: Judge Christopher Dupuy A Sept. 19, 2013, Houston Chronicle news story said, "A suspended Galveston judge pleaded guilty Thursday to two misdemeanors in exchange for two years of probation. County Court-at-Law Judge Christopher Dupuy pleaded guilty to abuse of office and perjury in exchange for two years of deferred adjudication. … The petition for removal accuses Dupuy of failing to obey an order from a state appeals court, abusing his authority by retaliating against attorneys and threatening the district clerk while attempting to interfere in his own divorce case." State vs. Scott Tidwell An Oct. 5, 2011, Associated Press news story said, "A former West Texas county attorney will spend four months in jail for retaliating against two nurses who made an anonymous complaint about a doctor to state medical regulators. … The nurses were fired from their jobs at a hospital in Kermit and charged with felonies." Our ruling Abbott said, "As attorney general, I have prosecuted judges, district attorneys and other public officials across Texas who violated that (public) trust, who have been corrupted."

pomt-10938	Says Judge Brett Kavanaugh "ruled that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was unconstitutional (reversed by full Circuit Court)."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/25/amy-klobuchar/trump-brett-kavanaugh-scotus-cfpb-unconstitutional/	Democrats are using a court decision on their hard-fought financial industry watchdog to raise red flags about President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court pick. U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said Brett Kavanaugh wrote an opinion opposing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. "Serious concerns I have about Judge Kavanaugh in addition to the obvious health care & separation of power issues: He ruled that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was unconstitutional (reversed by full Circuit Court) & went out of his way to dissent against net neutrality," Klobuchar tweeted on July 9. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., made the same claim in a tweet. We wondered whether Kavanaugh had indeed ruled the CFPB was unconstitutional. Largely, yes. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau The bureau has stirred controversy from the start. Warren was an early advocate for the CFPB and was considered the likely first head until a potential appointment was opposed by Republicans in Congress. Obama’s second choice, Richard Cordray, was also kept from taking office, until Obama sidestepped GOP lawmakers by making a recess appointment. Cordray was later confirmed with some bipartisan support in 2013. (Cordray is now running for governor in Ohio.) Unlike most federal agencies, the bureau does not rely on appropriations for its funding. The bureau’s operating budget comes from the Federal Reserve and does not require congressional approval. The CFPB is headed by a single director with a five-year term who cannot be fired at will. The president may only remove the director for "inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office," according to the law that established it. What Kavanaugh said After CFPB imposed a $109 million fine on PHH Corp., the New Jersey mortgage service provider sued, challenging the constitutionality of the CFPB. In 2016, the D.C. Court of Appeals sided with the company and cleared the fine. Kavanaugh, one of the three judges, wrote the opinion. Kavanaugh wrote that the CFPB is "unconstitutionally structured." The structure, Kavanaugh argued, gives the CFPB director more unilateral authority than anyone in the government besides the president. In order to remedy the constitutional flaw, Kavanaugh wrote, Supreme Court precedent dictates a "narrower remedy" than shutting down the entire CFPB. Kavanaugh suggested allowing the president to supervise, direct and fire the director at will. That’s not exactly the same thing as finding the CFPB itself to be unconstitutional, but it’s close, law experts told us. A later decision by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld CFPB’s constitutionality. The question could still come to the Supreme Court. Aaron Klein, the policy director at Brookings Institution’s Center on Regulations and Markets, said that tying CFPB directly to the president, and thus election cycles, could curb its intended independence. "Reducing the independence of any financial regulator is likely to make them pursue less politically unpopular activities, like reining in credit practices during good times," he said. "That’s why financial regulation tends to only pass Congress after crises, and as the memory of the crisis fades, deregulation comes in." Our ruling Klobuchar said Kavanaugh "ruled that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was unconstitutional (reversed by full Circuit Court)." In 2016, Kavanaugh wrote the opinion for a three judge panel of the D.C. Circuit finding the CFPB structurally unconstitutional. The issue lay in the bureau’s leadership structure, not the bureau itself. That said, a change to its leadership structure could rein in the regulatory activities CFPB performs.

pomt-13954	"We've seen more manufacturing jobs created since I've been president than anytime since the 1990s. That's a fact."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/16/barack-obama/obama-weve-seen-more-manufacturing-jobs-created-an/	Attempting to defend his economic record, President Barack Obama cited manufacturing job creation as a key indicator of growth under his presidency. In a PBS NewsHour special held in Elkhart, Ind. — the RV capital of the world — Obama said that his presidency has seen more manufacturing jobs created since the 1990s when Bill Clinton was president. "We've seen more manufacturing jobs created since I've been president than anytime since the 1990s. That's a fact," Obama said. His statement came in a larger discussion of manufacturing, where Obama tried to assuage the concerns of his skeptics. During the interview, Obama also claimed that the United States has a bigger manufacturing base than it has for much of history, but that automation has led to fewer workers at the same time. But is what he claimed, that "we've seen more manufacturing jobs created since I've been president than anytime since the 1990s," truly a fact? In one sense, yes, but Obama is using some clever phrasing and picking a most advantageous timeframe. Manufacturing employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics best shows the situation. Remember, Obama took office in January 2009. As you can see, Obama actually has presided over a net loss of manufacturing jobs since he has been in office of about 95,000 jobs. But all of those losses are concentrated in the first year-plus of his presidency. Isolating the period from March 2010 forward, the number of manufacturing jobs steadily has been increasing (though not back to the 2009 levels). Between March 2010 (the trough of Obama’s presidency) and May 2016, there has been an increase of 832,000 manufacturing jobs. This is what Obama was referring to, the White House told us. And by that measure, that is indeed the greatest period of increase since the 1990s. Is it really an accomplishment, though? That’s debatable for several reasons. Bigger gains in the 1990s. The United States saw a bigger increase in manufacturing jobs in the 1990s. From July 1993 through April 1998, for instance, the country added 898,000 jobs. Manufacturing was in sharp decline for all of the 2000s. The chart above shows how far, how fast the manufacturing sector has fallen, and while the jobs picture has brightened in recent years — far fewer people remain employed in the manufacturing sector. At the start of 2000, there were a total of 17.28 million employed in manufacturing. Today, that number stands at 12.29 million We’ve seen job losses recently. The United States lost manufacturing jobs — 10,000 — in May 2016. Who deserves credit? And while Obama did not directly attribute the recent increases to his policies, that is an obvious implication. In that regard, it is important to note that other economic factors beyond the president’s control also played a role. Sujit CanagaRetna, a senior fiscal analyst at the Council of State Governments, said external influences such as energy production and the global economic climate also played a role. Our ruling "We've seen more manufacturing jobs created since I've been president than anytime since the 1990s. That's a fact." There has indeed been a consistent decline in manufacturing jobs between 1998 until 2010, so Obama is correct that his presidency has seen the largest period of sustained manufacturing growth since the 1990s. However, manufacturing jobs have still suffered a net loss over Obama’s term. Obama’s statement could lead people to believe there has been the first net gain compared to the 1990s, but that is incorrect — just the first growth spurt.

pomt-04186	Agriculture "is the strongest industry in Ohio."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/dec/12/john-kasich/john-kasich-says-agriculture-strongest-industry-oh/	Jobs in manufacturing, especially in the auto industry, drew so much attention in recent political campaigns that one observer speculated every man, woman and child in Ohio must spend their days building cars. PolitiFact Ohio knew that was a joke, but the focus on factories increased our interest in comments by Gov. John Kasich when he addressed the 2012 meeting of the Ohio Farm Bureau Federation on Nov. 29, 2012. The Ohio Capital Blog recorded the event. Agriculture, Kasich said, "is the strongest industry in Ohio" and "the bedrock of the state of Ohio." We've heard similar comments from others: Sen. Sherrod Brown ("the state's No. 1 industry"), the state Department of Agriculture ("Ohio's No. 1 industry") and the Farm Bureau itself ("Ohio's top industry"). It's a bipartisan claim. But PolitiFact Ohio wondered what measure makes agriculture No. 1. Employment? Dollars generated? Taxes levied? Square footage? So we called Kasich's office and the state Agriculture Department and asked for sources. Both referred us to "OHFOOD," for Ohio food, which is an annually updated economic model developed by Thomas L. Sporleder, the much-cited professor of agribusiness at The Ohio State University. The model, by its own description, is designed "to capture the inter-dependencies and linkages among various sectors and industries composing the complex economy of Ohio" and "specifically to provide estimates of the economic importance of the food and agriculture-related cluster, along with the general manufacturing and service sectors, of the Ohio economy." Agriculture Department spokeswoman Erica Pitchford Hawkins said the analysis is the most comprehensive study available of Ohio agribusiness, and we could find nothing comparable. The most recent, from June 2012, uses data from 2010 gathered primarily federal and county level agencies, Sporleder said. In 2010, the study found, the total food and agricultural cluster contributed 11.7 percent, or $105 billion, of Ohio's total economic output of $898.7 billion. The cluster's share of the gross state product of $477.7 billion was $51 billion, or almost 11 percent. Ohio's gross state product improved by 1.3 percent from 2008 to 2010, the study said, while the portion attributed to the "agrifood" cluster increased about 30 percent. The agrifood cluster accounts for 14 percent of Ohio employment, or about 1 of 7 jobs. It gained 1 percent from 2008 to 2010, a period when total employment declined about 3 percent. There are some points worth noting: In the OHFOOD study, the "financial, legal and real estate" cluster is listed as a larger private sector of the state economy than the agrifood cluster. Kasich's office, though, pointed out that the grouping of financial services, legal services and real estate activities is particular to the study. That grouping is not used by such agencies as the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Sporleder told us the cluster is grouped because "it’s all service related," but "it’s not a supply chain" in the way food and agriculture is. That leaves food and agriculture the biggest sector of the state economy. "If you’re only talking about commodities, that’s not the case," Sporleder said, meaning the cluster is more than just farming. "If you’re talking wheat to flour to bread, you get the sector build-up. It’s an interdependent supply chain." More than just farming, the "agrifood" or "agribusiness" cluster also encompasses processing, wholesaling and retailing, and food services. As a group, it accounts for $3 billion of the gross state product in the OHFOOD mode. Kasich described agriculture as the strongest industry in Ohio. Data shows that the agrifood sector is the largest sector of the state’s economy. His statement is accurate. On the Truth-O-Meter, it rates True.

pomt-04513	Says Mitt Romney's plan "calls for a $5 trillion tax cut."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/04/barack-obama/obama-says-romneys-plan-5-trillion-tax-cut/	Early in the first presidential debate, President Barack Obama attacked Mitt Romney’s tax plan as unbalanced and devastating for the middle class. He charged that Romney’s plan "calls for a $5 trillion tax cut," and challenged him to defend it. The candidates repeatedly disagreed about that number. Four times the president spoke of Romney’s $5 trillion tax cut, and four times the governor rejected it. Obama said: "Governor Romney's proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military. And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions. The problem is that he's been asked over 100 times how you would close those deductions and loopholes, and he hasn't been able to identify them." Later, Romney countered: "I'm not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut. What I've said is I won't put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit. That's part one. So there's no economist that can say Mitt Romney's tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan." Obama has talked about the $5 trillion tax cut for months. We have looked at this claim before and found it lacked important context. Here’s why. The claim is based on a study done by the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan group that has analyzed the tax plans of the candidates. The center examined Romney’s proposals for a 20 percent reduction in all federal income tax rates, eliminating the Alternative Minimum Tax, eliminating the estate tax and other tax reductions. The center estimated that altogether, the lost revenues would total $480 billion by 2015. The Obama campaign adds up the cost over a decade and winds up with $4.8 trillion, which it then rounds up to $5 trillion. The conclusion is accurate but misleading. Yes, the cuts would total that amount, but as Obama himself noted as he continued speaking, Romney hopes to offset the lost revenues by closing loopholes and deductions. The reductions in tax breaks are as much a part of Romney’s plan as the tax cuts. But Obama is right in pointing out that Romney has yet to specify what tax breaks he would change. The most Romney has personally said is that he might cap deductions at $17,000, but that is a broad figure and does not describe how the number would be achieved. The impact of changing deductions on the scale needed to offset the tax cuts would be great. The largest deductions include interest on home mortgages, state and local taxes and the tax free treatment of health benefits. These are real pocketbook issues for most households and tinkering with them could have significant effects on large sectors of the economy. Romney offers key details on the taxes he would cut. But in explaining how to pay for them, he has essentially said only that he would keep the overall tax burden the same across all income groups by changing unnamed tax breaks. Our ruling President Obama said Mitt Romney seeks a $5 trillion tax cut. The $5 trillion figure accounts for only half of Romney’s plan -- and it's cumulative over 10 years. The governor says he will offset those lost revenues by reducing tax deductions and eliminating loopholes. However, he has never said what those changes would be. The president made a misleading statement about an incomplete plan, but he did describe what the plan was missing and Romney would not fill in the gaps. We rate the statement Half True.

Jim Justice recently took to Twitter to tout the state’s E-ZPass system. On Aug. 27, Justice tweeted, "BIG SAVINGS: I promised a great E-ZPass deal and here it is. Thousands of folks are opening West Virginia E-ZPass accounts, and you can join them! If you sign up now, your plan will automatically transition to the $24 three-year plan in September." We wondered whether it was correct that "thousands of folks are opening West Virginia E-ZPass accounts." (Justice’s office did not respond to an inquiry.) See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com In our initial inquiry in September, Dalphord W. Webb, director of customer service operations for West Virginia E-ZPass, had said hard numbers were not yet available. He added, however, that "we have been experiencing unprecedented growth over the last several months. This growth has resulted in a significant rise in applications, both paper and online, as well as emails, phone calls and walk-ins." By late October, Webb was able to provide hard numbers. He sent PolitiFact a statement that said that "from August 1 through October 15, there were 13,630 new West Virginia E-ZPass accounts opened." If you prorate the number of new accounts that would have been opened between August 1 and August 27 -- the day of Justice’s tweet -- it works out to a bit under 5,000. That still counts as "thousands." It’s worth noting that the only E-ZPass toll road in the state is the West Virginia Turnpike, which runs from Charleston southeast to Princeton. So the "great E-ZPass deal" would only be worthwhile for residents of southern West Virginia or those who drive through that region with some regularity. (It would also be useful for anyone who travels outside the state in areas with E-ZPass roads.) Our ruling Justice tweeted that "thousands of folks are opening West Virginia E-ZPass accounts." The E-ZPass authority reported 13,630 new accounts between August 1 and October 15. Prorated to the period covered by Justice’s tweet, that works out to about 5,000, which meets the definition of "thousands." We rate the statement True.

pomt-13828	"(Mexican immigrants) are more law-abiding than U.S. citizens and that is a statistic."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/14/gary-johnson/mexican-immigrants-more-law-abiding/	Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson challenged Donald Trump’s label of Mexican immigrants as murderers and rapists, saying they actually follow the law more than U.S. citizens. In a July 3 interview on CNN’s State of the Union, Johnson spoke with host Brianna Keilar about comments the presumptive Republican nominee has made about Muslims and Mexicans. Johnson, a former New Mexico governor, said Trump has said things that would disqualify anyone else from running for president. Keilar asked Johnson if he thought Trump was racist. "When it comes to Mexican immigration and that he would call immigrants from Mexico murderers and rapists look, that’s just not true," Johnson said. "They are more law-abiding than U.S. citizens, and that is a statistic." We wondered if there really was a statistic to support Johnson’s statement that Mexican immigrants commit fewer crimes than U.S. citizens. Immigrants up, crime down Johnson based his comments on data cited in a July 2015 Wall Street Journal opinion piece by Jason L. Riley, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning Manhattan Institute. Riley’s commentary focused on studies that show immigrants — irrespective of nationality or legal status — "are less likely than the native population to commit violent crimes or to be incarcerated." Riley points to a July 2015 report by the American Immigration Council, a pro-immigrant nonprofit in Washington. The council analyzed data from the Census’ 2010 American Community Survey and found that about 1.6 percent of all immigrant males (Census does not specify legal status) between 18 and 39 years old were incarcerated, compared to 3.3 percent of the native-born population. The council also reported 2010 Census data that shows incarceration rates of young, less educated Mexican, Salvadoran and Guatemalan men — which comprise the bulk of the unauthorized population — are "significantly lower" than incarceration rates of native-born young men without a high-school diploma. Specifically for Mexican men ages 18 to 39, the incarceration rate in 2010 was 2.8 percent, compared to 10.7 percent for native-born men in the same age group, the council’s report said. Immigrants come to the United States to build better lives for themselves and their children, said Walter A. Ewing, a senior researcher at the American Immigration Council and one of the report’s authors. "They are very motivated to not blow that opportunity by getting in trouble with the police," he said in an email interview. "This is especially so for unauthorized immigrants, who can be deported at any time for unlawful presence." And even as the immigrant population increases, crime has gone down, the report said. Between 1990 and 2013, the foreign-born share of the U.S. population increased from 7.9 percent to 13.1 percent, and the number of unauthorized immigrants went up from 3.5 million to 11.2 million. At the same time, violent crime rate (murder, rape and aggravated assault) decreased 48 percent and property crime rate fell 41 percent, the report said, citing FBI data. Bianca E. Bersani, an assistant professor and director of the Criminology and Criminal Justice Program at the University of Massachusetts Boston, says her research also shows that crime involvement among foreign-born residents is lower than that of U.S.-born citizens. It holds true for Mexican immigrants, she said. "When ethnicity can be distinguished and Mexican immigrants isolated from the group of first-generation immigrants, research continues to find that Mexican immigrants have lower rates of involvement in crime compared to their U.S-born peers," Bersani said. Recent studies tracking changes over time also found that areas of the country with an increased foreign-born population do not experience corresponding increases in crime, said Bersani. "The rhetoric of the ‘criminal immigrant’ does not align with the bulk of empirical research," Bersani said. According to Bersani’s research, while first-generation immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the native-born population, the second generation (individuals born in the United States to at least one foreign-born parent) more closely resemble patterns of their native-born peers (three or more U.S.-born generations). "This does not suggest that the second generation is uniquely crime prone, but instead that they are acting in ways that are no different from the rest of the U.S.-born population," Bersani said. Datasets with information on both crime and immigrant status are rare, Bersani said, though more research and data are becoming available. The Center for Immigration Studies, which supports stricter immigration policies, in a 2009 study said that overall understanding of immigrants and crime "remains confused" due to lack of data and contrary information. Unless inmates are identified as immigrant or native-born, incarceration rates are a poor way to measure links between immigrants and crime, the study said. Deportations of criminal immigrants may also decrease immigrant incarceration rates because many will not return to the United States and commit more crimes, as could be the case with native-born criminals, the CIS report said. There isn’t exact data on how many undocumented immigrants are currently incarcerated. Our ruling Johnson said Mexican immigrants are not "murderers and rapists" but are actually "more law-abiding than U.S. citizens and that is a statistic." Numerous studies by scholars and partisan groups show that the foreign-born population is less likely to commit crimes than the native-born, and experts say this includes Mexican immigrants. Researchers agree more data is needed to get a better understanding of immigration and crime, but the information available does not disprove Johnson’s point. We rate Johnson’s statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/67eae50a-55c4-485e-bd36-697619caa1a5	None	Gary Johnson	None	None	None	2016-07-14T14:59:18	2016-07-03	['United_States', 'Mexico']
pomt-08770	"One of the things we found very clearly and consistently is that [video gaming] is a growth industry."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/aug/25/keith-stokes/wake-curt-schilling-deal-stokes-says-video-gaming-/	Many questions have been raised about the wisdom of the state Economic Development Commission's decision to guarantee $75 million in loans to 38 Studios, former Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling's video game company. In an interview aired Aug. 7 on WJAR-TV, EDC Executive Director Keith Stokes was asked whether the loan guarantee is a good investment for the state. "In the case of 38 Studios, we looked at this company very carefully," Stokes said. "One of the challenges we've had is that this industry, video gaming, is a fairly new industry but it's a very fast growth trajectory industry. We hired a series of national analysts to come in to look at -- not only 38 Studios as a company and their particular business model and their particular product that they were offering to the marketplace -- but we also looked at the industry in total. One of the things we found very clearly and consistently is that it is a growth industry." With most people hurting in the recession, we wondered whether the growth was clear and consistent. Melissa Chambers, senior communications manager for the EDC, sent us a PowerPoint presentation made by Wells Fargo Securities, dated June 14, 2010, showing the growth in the interactive game software industry. It said that worldwide software sales increased from $25.4 billion in 2006 to $46.6 billion in 2008, and predicted a whopping 28-percent jump in 2009. In North America alone, 2009 sales would go up by 23 percent, to $24.4 billion. But then we found some other sales numbers -- including actual numbers for 2009 -- that made us wonder about Stokes' statement. Less than a week after Stokes' TV interview, the Entertainment Software Association, an industry group for developers of video and computer games for consoles, personal computers and the Internet, released a sales report showing that the amount spent on games in the United States dropped by about $1.2 billion in 2009, going from $11.7 billion to $10.5 billion. That's a decline of 10.3 percent. Then we found a previous Software Association report on U.S. sales showing a dip in 2005, when consumer spending on games dropped by about $400 million, to $7 billion. The dip wasn't reflected in the Wells Fargo report, which begins with 2006. Because the United States makes up the bulk of the North American market, we wanted to find out why Wells Fargo's 2009 positive sales projections seemed so far from the actual sales numbers reported by the ESA. We asked the EDC for all the reports it has received that might be relevant to the issue, hoping to find out whether the U.S. numbers reflected a worldwide trend. The corporation sent us another PowerPoint presentation, this one from Strategy Analytics, based in Newton, Mass. It didn't contain any numbers that seemed relevant, so we contacted the firm directly. Jia Wu, a digital media analyst for Strategy, confirmed that U.S. and North American sales for video and online games declined by more than 2 percent in 2009. Worldwide sales, he said, rose by just two thirds of 1 percent, going from $46.2 billion to $46.5 billion. That's a far cry from the 28 percent worldwide jump Wells Fargo predicted for 2009. Then we heard from Lewis Ward, research manager of gaming at International Data Corporation, which also tracks worldwide software game sales, who said that his figures showed a 5-percent decline in in 2009. We also found two reports from February -- four months before Wells Fargo presented its rosy 2009 projections to the EDC -- showing that 2009 was a rough year for the industry. One was from three video game sales tracking companies reporting that overall software sales in the United States, United Kingdom and Japanese markets dropped by 8 percent. The other was a Feb. 19, 2010, press release from Strategy Analytics stating that "2009 was a tough year for video game publishers." In addition, the Strategy Analytics PowerPoint the EDC gave us notes, under the category of "Mitigating risk factors," that "Game industry does have cycles." While the numbers differ from analyst to analyst, the overall theme is contrary to the assertion Stokes made on Channel 10. We asked the EDC to put us in touch with its Wells Fargo representative. They said they weren't able to provide an analyst to speak with us and, instead, sent us to Fred Hashway, the EDC's director of government affairs and policy. He said it really doesn't matter if sales declined in 2009 because "the individual year is irrelevant" to what EDC considers to be more important -- the long-term trend. Wells Fargo's "forecasting ability is still excellent. You don't look at it at one year. You look at it over a period of time." Wells Fargo is predicting good things for the industry, he said. Hashway also said any 2005 U.S. sales dip is "a distinction without a difference" for the same reason -- broader trends are more important. "I think we went back as far as we needed to." By all accounts, the video gaming industry has grown substantially since the 1990s, topping more than $46 billion worldwide. But the sharp drop in U.S. sales in 2005 and 2009, combined with last year's minimal increase in global sales -- or decline, depending on who's giving you the numbers -- show that, at least for those years, the growth in the industry has not been consistent. Strategy Analytics, in its report to the EDC projecting double-digit growth over the next five years for the type of game 38 Studios plans to develop, noted as much. Stokes could have said that the overall trend in the video gaming business has been strongly upward despite a downturn or two. But he didn't. He said growth in the industry was clear and consistent. So we rate his comment as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

Scott Hochberg, D-Houston. "We do have a serious problem in this state," he said to a June 25 caucus at the Texas Democratic convention. "We have many. But one of them is when our kids graduate from high school, the proportion that go to college is small. And more seriously, even those who go, only about a third of them are getting through." Two out of three Texas students who go to college don’t graduate? We wondered. As back-up, Hochberg forwarded us data he received from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, which oversees the state’s public colleges and universities. The board tracked students who were in seventh grade in 1997-98 and therefore could have graduated from college by 2009. Results? Some 32 percent of the 168,739 students who entered a Texas college after high school had graduated within a six-year period with a bachelor’s degree, an associate degree or certificate (in real estate or law enforcement, for example). A couple of caveats: First, the data don’t account for students who enrolled in a Texas institution and then transferred out of state. Second, while the enrollment data include the 6 percent of students who attended school out of state, it doesn’t track whether they graduated. A one-time shot of grant money did allow the board to track how many Texans enrolled in 7th grade in 1994-95 had earned college degrees both in and out of state within a six-year period by 2006. It found that of 8,028 high school graduates enrolled in school out of state, almost 50 percent earned a degree or certificate. However, of 134,473 students enrolled in Texas, 36.5 percent graduated. Combined, about 37 percent of the tracked graduates earned a degree or certificate. Andy Kesling, the board’s communications director, said Hochberg is correct that only about one-third of those students graduated from a Texas college. But, he said, it "all depends on how you look at the data. One thing I’m really concerned about is people go away with the impression that only one third of the students going to school in Texas are graduating. If you look at the six-year graduation rate of Texas universities, the graduation rate is 57 percent." That means that of the students who entered a four-year public university in Texas in the fall of 2002, 57 percent graduated within six years, by September 2009. That includes students who transferred to another public or private school in Texas. Hochberg quibbles with that graduation rate because it excludes the many students who attend institutions like community colleges. "It’s not apples to apples," he said. "It’s only the best apples." Of some 300,000 Texas students who were enrolled in 7th grade in 1997-98, about 63,800 later enrolled in a four-year school, like the University of Texas, while 90,800 enrolled in a two-year school, like Austin Community College. That is, about 60 percent of students pursuing post-secondary education go the community college route. Their graduation rate is far lower. Of the students enrolled full time at a community college in the fall of 2002, the board found that only 11 percent graduated within three years, by 2005. The coordinating board isn’t alone in tracking college graduation rates. Using U.S. Census Bureau data, the Chronicle of Higher Education, a Washington-based journal, reported in April that 30.7 percent of Texas 25- to 34-year-olds had college degrees, compared to 38 percent nationally. Then there’s the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems, which found that as of 2008, 49 percent of first-time full-time Texas students seeking a bachelor’s degree graduated within six years, ranking the state 35th nationally. Looking at the percentage of first-time full-time students seeking their associate degrees, the center found Texas fared worse: 18.6 percent, ranking 41st in the country. Looking at the raw numbers, we found that 35.2 percent of students seeking an associate or bachelor’s degree graduated. Where does this leave Hochberg’s statement? As we learned in earlier checking candidate claims about high-school graduation rates, there are several ways to sort the numbers. The state’s six-year graduation rate at universities, for example, is far higher than the rate Hochberg cites. Yet rolling students seeking associate degrees into the equation supports Hochberg’s assessment. About a third of Texas students lately graduate from a Texas college. His statement is True.

pomt-11135	"Since the end of the financial crisis, we have seen an average of one community bank or credit union disappear every day."	mostly true	/pennsylvania/statements/2018/may/31/keith-rothfus/rothfus-claim-about-disappearing-banks-mostly-true/	According to U.S. Rep. Keith Rothfus, community banks have been collateral damage in Dodd-Frank’s push to rein in big banks. Rothfus said America has lost an average of one community bank or credit union every day since the end of the Great Recession, when Dodd-Frank became law. Rothfus, a Republican, made the claim in a press release explaining his May 22 vote in favor of a partial rollback of Dodd-Frank, the Obama-era law containing new financial sector controls and consumer protections inspired by the banking industry’s role in the financial collapse of 2007. We stumbled upon the claim when comparing Rothfus’ voting record to that of rookie Democratic Congressman Conor Lamb, who is after Rothfus’ seat in the newly drawn 17th District, which includes Beaver and parts of Allegheny County. "Since the end of the financial crisis, we have seen an average of one community bank or credit union disappear every day," Rothfus said. The Great Recession ended in June 2009 — though the recovery continues in many places. Dodd-Frank was signed into law by President Barack Obama one year later and has remained on the books. So is Rothfus’ claim about a decimated community banking sector accurate? Here’s what we found. The rollback Rothfus made his claim after voting in favor of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, S. 2155, which supporters said will lessen the Dodd-Frank burden on community banking institutions — defined as those with less than $10 billion in assets — and which critics argue creates wiggle room and loopholes that larger banks will exploit. The rollback was signed into law by President Donald Trump on May 24. In explaining his "yes" vote two days earlier, Rothfus said, "Today a House majority that included both Republicans and nearly three dozen Democrats voted to right-size regulations for our community and regional financial institutions. Since the end of the financial crisis, we have seen an average of one community bank or credit union disappear every day." As we stated above, the Great Recession ended in June 2009, the point at which real GDP and industrial production hit bottom and resumed growth. So we’ll start with the third fiscal quarter of 2009 in looking at the number of community banks reporting to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC. According to FDIC data, there were 7,309 community banks in the third quarter of 2009, and that number decreased every quarter since, winding up at 5,168 in the first quarter of this year. (When asked to cite the source of his claim, Rothfus’ office pointed to FDIC data.) That’s a decrease of 2,141 reporting institutions over 35 fiscal quarters or roughly 244 fewer a year. The decline in community bank numbers certainly has continued under Dodd-Frank. But it was also underway long before the Great Recession and Dodd-Frank ever took hold. "From 1985 to 2013, the number of the smallest institutions has declined dramatically (85 percent to be exact)," PolitiFact reported in 2015. "But mid-size and large community banks have remained relatively stable since 2010 (and have increased, albeit incrementally, since 1985)." The report adds: "Two-thirds of failed or voluntarily closed community banks are actually acquired by other community banks, according to the FDIC. The result: fewer, but larger community banks. Their goal: to achieve ‘economies of scale’ (cost advantages gained when spreading out expenses over more revenue), says the U.S. Government Accountability Office." A 2015 paper published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City found the number of "failed" community banks went down under Dodd-Frank — from roughly 125 in 2010 to less than 25 in 2014 — while the number of community banks involved in voluntary mergers grew in that same period — from roughly 175 to more than 225. PolitiFact found that the consolidation craze was "a 30-year trend" with various underlying causes — they include a softening of interstate banking rules in the ’80s. And while some experts say Dodd-Frank has exacerbated the trend, the law’s exact impact remains the subject of much debate. What about credit unions? According to National Credit Union Administration data, there were 7,691 federally insured credit unions in the U.S. in June 2009. That number fell to 5,573 in the last quarter of 2017 — the most recent quarter for which data is available. That’s 2,118 fewer federally insured credit unions, or roughly 282 fewer a year. John Fairbanks with the Office of Public and Congressional Affairs at the National Credit Union Administration said the "federally insured credit union" figures above include all but roughly 125 credit unions — those are privately insured — in the United States. Fairbanks told PolitiFact Pennsylvania that it’s important to note what’s happening with these "disappearing" credit unions. "That does not mean those institutions were simply ‘lost.’ Most credit union ‘losses’ are the result of mergers, usually a smaller credit union into a larger one, and usually for a business-related purpose, such as the smaller credit union being unable to provide a greater array of services to members," Fairbanks said. "So credit union members do not ‘lose’ a credit union; it folds into another one. The numbers go down, but note that credit union membership and industry assets continue to grow." So mergers are increasingly common with both U.S. credit unions and community banks. Fairbanks added, "This, by the way, is a long-running trend in credit unions and financial services generally, going back decades. The consolidation process is nothing new." As for the bill supported by Rothfus, the National Law Review says it could actually speed up the pace of community and regional bank mergers by raising the threshold for "enhanced prudential standards" applied to big banks from $50 billion to $250 billion. "The increase in this threshold is especially important because it may spark renewed interest in [merger and acquisition] opportunities among regional banks that have carefully managed growth to avoid crossing $50 billion or that have otherwise been reluctant to pursue transactions in light of the significant regulatory scrutiny that has accompanied applications by large acquirors," the Law Review reports. Our ruling Rothfus said, "Since the end of the financial crisis, we have seen an average of one community bank or credit union disappear every day." His statement is supported by data for that timeframe from both the FDIC and National Credit Union Administration. Since the third quarter of 2009, America lost 2,141 community banks and 2,118 credit unions. That’s 4,259 financial institutions total. Over roughly eight years, that’s 486 per year or roughly 1.4 per day. However, some banks "disappeared" due to voluntary consolidation, something that has been happening for 30 years, and not always as a direct result of Dodd-Frank. Therefore, Rothfus’ claim — given its context — is Mostly True.	None	Keith Rothfus	None	None	None	2018-05-31T14:52:18	2018-05-22	['None']
pomt-05088	Lorain "is the poorest urban school district in the state of Ohio."	false	/ohio/statements/2012/jul/02/dan-ramos/dan-ramos-says-lorain-poorest-school-district-ohio/	State lawmakers generally agreed that too many Ohio school children are struggling to read during a debate in June on legislation to advance Gov. John Kasich’s education agenda. But many Democrats in the House of Representatives voted against the Republican governor’s education policies, which included a third-grade reading guarantee, when they were up for a vote on June 13. Their reasons for opposition varied. Some thought the changes amounted to an unfunded mandate on schools whose state funding already had been cut through Kasich’s budget. Rep. Dan Ramos, a Democrat from Lorain, said the bill was incomplete because it lacked early education programs such as all-day kindergarten to prepare young students, particularly children in poverty. During a floor speech June 13, Ramos made clear his district’s educational needs: "I represent, amongst others, the city of Lorain, which is the poorest urban school district in the state of Ohio." Ramos was one of several lawmakers to speak that day about the bill, Senate Bill 316, also known as the "education MBR" because it was the education component of Kasich’s mid-biennium budget review. The bill passed the House that day by a vote of 56-35, with most Democrats voting "no." Although Ramos’ claim is not about specific provisions in the bill, it caught our attention. Does Lorain really hold the unwanted title of the state’s poorest urban school district. So we called Ramos for an explanation. Ramos said he did not have any statistics or information that showed Lorain is the state’s single poorest district. He provided data from the Ohio Department of Education that shows the city is among districts with the highest percentage of poor students. "I should have said, ‘one of the’" poorest urban school districts, Ramos said. The city had the state’s sixth-highest percentage, 84.5 percent, of students in poverty in the fiscal year ending in July 2011. Students were considered to be living in poverty if they received free or reduced-priced lunches or if their guardians receive public assistance. Cleveland was first, with 100 percent of students in poverty; Dayton was second with 92.5 percent; Youngstown was third with 91.9 percent; East Cleveland was fourth with 88.5 percent and Akron was fifth with 84.7 percent. Lorain ranked fourth the previous year behind Cleveland, Dayton and Youngstown. Ramos said the fact Lorain is among the state’s poorest districts – rather than the single poorest – does not negate the overarching point of his floor speech: School children in Lorain are on hard times and need the state’s help to get a better education, however, the policies in SB 316 do not fully address those needs. Ramos may have a point. And he is correct to say students in Lorain are needy. But his explanation does not make his claim on the House floor accurate. The poorest urban school district in Ohio, in the eyes of the Ohio Department of Education, is Cleveland. On the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates False.

pomt-12480	"Larry Krasner is the only candidate running for District Attorney who explicitly pledges to never seek the death penalty."	mostly false	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/may/03/larry-krasner/philly-da-candidate-im-only-one-wholl-never-seek-d/	There’s really no question that Philadelphia civil rights attorney and candidate for district attorney Larry Krasner has been more outspoken on the death penalty than any of his seven opponents. But is he the only candidate running for district attorney who has explicitly pledged to never seek it if elected? Krasner’s campaign, gearing up for the May 16 primary, wrote on the Democratic candidate’s platform page on his website that "Larry Krasner is the only candidate running for District Attorney who explicitly pledges to never seek the death penalty." But we swear we’ve heard that before, at least once. So we decided to check the claim. We reached out to every candidate for district attorney -- six other Democrats and one Republican -- to ask for clarification on their stance on the death penalty, including whether or not they support Gov. Tom Wolf’s death penalty moratorium (that could be overturned when another governor takes office). Here’s what we learned: Beth Grossman - We didn’t hear back from Grossman, the lone Republican candidate in the race, but she told Philadelphia Magazine in March that she supports the death penalty "in certain cases," but wondered if it’s "economically feasible." Michael Untermeyer - Untermeyer, an ex-Republican and a former assistant district attorney, doesn’t personally support the death penalty but wouldn’t rule it out in the most extreme circumstances, his campaign said. Joe Khan - A spokesman for Khan, a former federal prosecutor, said the Democrat would only seek the death penalty in the most extreme circumstances. During a recent forum when candidates were asked if they would ever seek the death penalty, Khan responded that he wouldn’t while a statewide moratorium is in place. Jack O’Neill - O’Neill, a former assistant district attorney and a Democrat, said while prosecuting homicides in Philadelphia, he never chose to seek the death penalty. But he said he wouldn’t rule it out in the most heinous circumstances, like if a police officer were killed. Teresa Carr-Deni - The former judge’s campaign confirmed her stance is that she would only seek the death penalty in extreme or heinous circumstances. Rich Negrin - Negrin, the former city managing director, didn’t respond to a request for comment. But during a recent forum when asked if he would ever seek the death penalty if elected, Negrin responded "no." That’s a harder stance than he took in a February interview with Philadelphia Magazine, when he said only that he supports Wolf’s moratorium, not that he would never seek the death penalty if that moratorium were to be lifted. Tariq El-Shabazz - A spokeswoman for El-Shabazz, a former deputy under District Attorney Seth Williams, said El-Shabazz "will not seek to impose the death penalty." In the same forum mentioned above when asked about whether or not he would seek the death penalty, El-Shabazz responded "no" -- twice. But similar to Negrin, that’s different from his prior characterization. In an interview with Philadelphia Magazine in March, El-Shabazz said only that he supports Wolf’s moratorium. That means that besides Krasner, two other candidates in the race -- Negrin and El-Shabazz -- have said at one point or another that they would not seek the death penalty if elected district attorney, but both failed to offer up that hard stance when asked earlier this year. (In Krasner’s February Philadelphia Magazine interview, he said he’s strictly against the death penalty and would never seek it if elected.) A spokeswoman for El-Shabazz said his stance is "not new," and the candidate himself said last month that he has opposed the death penalty for his entire career. PolitiFact Pennsylvania could not find an example from prior to April when either Negrin or El-Shabazz said publicly that they would never seek the death penalty if elected district attorney. When PolitiFact reached out to Krasner’s campaign Monday regarding the statement on their website that Krasner is "the only candidate running for District Attorney who explicitly pledges to never seek the death penalty," a spokesman responded that that language has since been updated. The website now reads: "Larry Krasner is the only candidate running for District Attorney who explicitly pledges to never seek the death penalty and has done so throughout the campaign." "Some of the other candidates have changed their positions so quickly that it's hard to keep up," spokesman Rich Garella said in an email, noting: "We have now adjusted the language on our website to reflect the fact that two of them have recently adopted the position that [Krasner] has had for more than 30 years." Garella wasn’t able to identify when the claim in question was posted on Krasner’s campaign website. Krasner, a well-known civil rights and criminal defense attorney, has long been an outspoken critic of the death penalty. Our ruling Krasner’s campaign for district attorney wrote that he "is the only candidate running for District Attorney who explicitly pledges to never seek the death penalty." At this point in the race, two other candidates have made a similar pledge. But it doesn’t appear either of those candidates were as explicit about that view throughout the campaign, unlike Krasner, who has long railed against the death penalty. When PolitiFact pointed out the discrepancy to Krasner’s campaign, the website was almost immediately updated. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-09087	Sharron Angle supported "a Scientology plan to give massages to prisoners."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/24/harry-reid/reid-ad-claims-angle-supported-scientology-plan-gi/	Shortly after Sharron Angle won the Nevada Republican primary, Democratic opponent Harry Reid quickly picked up on some of the attacks levelled against Angle by her Republican primary opponent. According to a Reid ad, Angle supported "a Scientology plan to give massages to prisoners." As a Nevada Assemblywoman in 2003, Angle pushed for Nevada to try a controversial drug and criminal rehabilitation program based on the teachings of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. Angle mulled legislation to bring a demonstration of the program -- called Second Chance -- to women's prisons in Nevada. And she was among a group of several Nevada legislators who made plans to travel to Mexico to see the program in action. According to a Feb. 18, 2003, story in the Las Vegas Review-Journal, the trip would have been paid by a private Arizona businessman with ties to the Church of Scientology. According to the Review Journal story, Angle defended the program, saying that while parts of the program were developed by Hubbard, his religion had nothing to do with the program. "I don't have any inclination toward Scientology,'' Angle said. "But when something works, you have to take a look at it." Angle parroted claims from the program leaders that only 10 percent of the inmates who enter the program return to drugs. But those claims are highly disputed. Nevada Assembly Majority Leader Barbara Buckley, a Democrat, said then that the program was costly and that legislators were told Mexican officials did not check on program participants after they left prison. Angle abandoned her efforts -- and canceled her planned trip to Mexico -- after she said it became clear that Democratic opposition to the program made it a non-starter. Angle's efforts on behalf of the Second Chance program first became political fodder for her Republican primary opponent Sue Lowden, who aired an ad in which the narrator says "Retreat, relax, renew. Unwind and enjoy the soothing sauna and massage treatments in Nevada prisons." Images of male prisoners getting back rubs flashed in the background. The Reid ad picks up on the same theme, showing a male prisoner getting a massage, but does more of a quick hit with, "That's Sharron Angle. First, a Scientology plan to give massages to prisoners. Now she wants to get rid of Medicare and Social Security. What's next?" We addressed the claim that Angle "wants to wipe out Social Security" in a separate item. Here we're looking at the claim that Angle supported "a Scientology plan to give massages to prisoners." We'll take this in two parts. First, is it accurate to call Second Chance a "Scientology plan"? Church of Scientology officials have long contended that Criminon and Narconon, the parent programs of Second Chance, are secular programs unaffiliated with the Church of Scientology. According to Narconon officials, Narconon was not founded by Hubbard, but by William Benitez, who while an inmate in an Arizona prison read books by Hubbard and applied his principles in developing a drug treatment program. However, many of the techniques and courses used in the program are similar to those practiced by Scientologists, which is why many Scientology observers say that at best, the line between Scientology and programs like Criminon and Narconon are blurred. As for the claim that Second Chance was a "plan to give massages to prisoners," we think that's a gross oversimplification of the program. The ad suggests the sum of the program is akin to some sort of spa experience. The program does incorporate the use of saunas as part of a purported detoxification program that mirrors a Scientology ritual called the purification rundown. The use of saunas is based on Hubbard's belief that it is possible to sweat out toxic substances and drug residues, which can cause cravings for more drugs. The program also incorporates the use of "nerve assists." According to an online Scientology handbook, nerve assists are used to straighten joints and the spine. According to the handbook, "The Nerve Assist consists of gently releasing the standing waves in the nerve channels of the body, improving communication with the body and bringing the being relief." What follows is a detailed set of instructions on how to administer a nerve assist. In a candidate debate on Face to Face with Jon Ralston on May 18, 2010, Angle said "it wasn't actually massages, it was really more of a karate chop. And the sauna I would say was a sweat box, in there with 30 sweaty guys is not exactly a sauna." By our reckoning, though, the method described in the Scientology handbook resembles a back massage, at least enough so that calling it that is not out of order. But there's more to the Second Chance Program than saunas and nerve assists. It also includes a series of life improvement courses, such as ones aimed at improving communication skills. News reports in the Wall Street Journal, Santa Fe Journal and the Los Angeles Times detail the workings of the program. It was used in New Mexico prisons for two years. We contacted William Miller, an addiction expert and a retired professor of psychiatry at the University of New Mexico, who reviewed Second Chance at the request of the city of Albuquerque and recommended against the city adopting and funding Second Chance. Via e-mail, Miller told us it is a "Scientology-based program that has no scientific credibility." And it no longer is operating in New Mexico prisons, he noted. "They consumed quite a bit of money for several years, performed poorly, and went out of business when governmental funding dried up for them," Miller said. We also called Angle's campaign for comment about the program and Angle's involvement. Campaign staffer Lee Adams said "it was something she looked at and ultimately said no." As we noted earlier, it wasn't so much that Angle decided the program didn't have merit. Rather, she made a political calculation that it didn't have enough support to pass, and so she declined to offer legislation that was DOA. For the record, Adams said, despite some rumors circulating around, Angle is not a Scientologist. "She's a Southern Baptist," he said. As for the claim in the Reid ad, we think it's accurate to point out Angle's one-time support for a controversial drug and crime rehabilitation program based on the teachings of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. But we think it's misleading to sum it up as back rubs for prisoners. There's a lot more to it than that. Some may find the idea of taxpayer support for the program equally as troubling, but this was more about supporting a controversial drug treatment program than one aimed at coddling criminals with massages. And so we rate the ad's claim Half True.	None	Harry Reid	None	None	None	2010-06-24T17:37:25	2010-06-12	['None']
pomt-01331	Says Scott Walker is "forcing some women to undergo a transvaginal probe to get an abortion."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/24/emilys-list/scott-walker-forces-some-women-get-transvaginal-ul/	In backing Mary Burke in the Nov. 4, 2014 election for governor, at least three abortion rights organizations have produced ads highlighting Gov. Scott Walker’s opposition to abortion. But one TV ad from EMILY’s List, a Washington, D.C.-based group, might be the most blunt. Halfway into the 30-second spot, released Oct. 21, 2014, the narrator says Walker "is forcing some women to undergo a transvaginal probe to get an abortion." As the words are spoken, a headline appears on the screen that reads: "Scott Walker endorses mandating transvaginal ultrasounds." It is made to look like a newspaper headline, but it comes from an article on the left-leaning Think Progress blog. A medical device is also shown. A series of readers asked us to check the claim. "Transvaginal" is the attention-grabbing word in the claim. But as we’ll see, the reference to "some women" is important, too. Abortion and ultrasounds The ad alludes to a July 2013 Wisconsin law that requires women seeking an abortion to get an ultrasound -- either transabdominally, which is done externally, or transvaginally. Wisconsin is among two dozen states that require an ultrasound before an abortion is performed. In Wisconsin, exceptions are made in cases of sexual assault or medical emergency. The governor’s office praised the measure, saying it "improves a woman's ability to make an informed choice that will protect her physical and mental health now and in the future." The law was opposed by the Wisconsin Medical Society, among others. The society said the measure as a "direct infringement on the patient-physician relationship" and for injecting "non-evolving government mandates into medical science." (Another part of the law, which would require doctors who perform abortions to have hospital admitting privileges, has been blocked in an ongoing court battle.) As we turn to the EMILY’s List claim, one note: The use of ultrasounds among abortion providers is not new, even though the Wisconsin law requiring them is. A couple of weeks after Walker signed the measure, the clinic director and another worker at Affiliated Medical Services, a Milwaukee abortion provider, noted in an opinion piece in the Huffington Post that their clinic has "always" required ultrasounds. "If you go to an abortion clinic that doesn't insist on an ultrasound, you should walk out the door. It's just bad medicine," they wrote. The Milwaukee clinic workers also pointed out, however, that the Wisconsin law does not require a transvaginal ultrasound and that they would have opposed that requirement. They said their clinic only does transvaginal ultrasounds when it is deemed medically necessary -- in cases of early pregnancy, morbid obesity, or "anatomical variants" in the uterus. Tracy Weitz, associate professor and director of the Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health at the University of California, San Francisco, said that nationally, transvaginal ultrasounds are routine among abortion providers in the early stages of pregnancy. They can verify a pregnancy as early as four weeks, meaning women don’t have to wait through weeks of pregnancy symptoms and distress before choosing to have an abortion, she wrote. Evidence for the claim As we’ve indicated, the law Walker signed does not mandate a transvaginal ultrasound -- though the headline used in the ad says Walker endorsed mandating that procedure. Rather, the law requires "an ultrasound on the pregnant woman using whichever transducer the woman chooses" -- either transvaginal or transabdominal -- according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Legislative Council. But there is more to consider. Under the law, the person doing the ultrasound must tell the pregnant woman during the procedure "what the ultrasound is depicting," including the "dimensions of the unborn child and a description of any external features and internal organs that are present and viewable on the image." The person must also display the ultrasound images so that the pregnant woman may view them, but the woman can’t be forced to view them. Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin told us that only a transvaginal ultrasound would enable a clinician to meet the requirements of the law for early-stage pregnancies, up to 12 weeks. And according to an August 2014 report from the state Department of Health Services, 84 percent of abortions in Wisconsin are performed at 12 weeks or less. EMILY’s List, meanwhile, noted that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says transvaginal ultrasound often is used in early pregnancy, whereas transabdominal ultrasound often is used after about 10 weeks of pregnancy. And the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that studies reproductive rights, says "routine ultrasound is not considered medically necessary as a component of first-trimester abortion." Barbara Lyons, the former executive director of Wisconsin Right to Life, which opposes abortion, told us that even if a medical situation indicates that a woman seeking an abortion should get a transvaginal ultrasound, the woman still has the final say and the Wisconsin law doesn’t mandate one over the other. "In the end, she gets to make the decision," Lyons said. "There is no mandate." To sum up: The law doesn’t mandate a transvaginal ultrasound. But for some women, the fact that an ultrasound is required means they would have to get the transvaginal procedure, rather than a transabdominal one, in order to get an abortion. Our rating In a TV ad, EMILY’s List said Walker is "forcing some women to undergo a transvaginal probe to get an abortion," while an image on the screen said Walker "endorses mandating transvaginal ultrasounds." The law doesn’t mandate transvaginal ultrasounds, rather it says the woman seeking an abortion can choose either a transvaginal or transabdominal ultrasound. But medical professionals say that the new requirement, as a practical matter, means some women have to get a transvaginal ultrasound.

pomt-02022	"Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen has long record of voting against VA backlog fixes."	false	/florida/statements/2014/jun/06/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/ileana-ros-lehtinen-voted-against-va-backlog-fixes/	As President Barack Obama faced attacks over long waits for appointments at Veterans Administration health centers, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee -- the House Democrats’ campaign arm -- engaged in some finger-pointing. The DCCC sent out press releases claiming that Republican House members Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Miami, Sean Duffy of Wisconsin and Erik Paulsen of Minnesota voted against fixing the VA backlog. Here is part of the June 2, 2014, press release about Ros-Lehtinen headlined "Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen has long record of voting against VA backlog fixes." "As House Republicans shamelessly try to score political points over the crisis in veterans care, Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen’s votes tell the true story of her record: when she had a chance to fix this problem, she voted against the fixes." The release went on to quote DCCC spokesman Josh Schwerin saying, "It’s a shame that when Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen had a chance to do something to help shorten the wait time at the VA she voted no. Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen voted against a commonsense solution to this problem and our heroes deserve better." We put those votes under a microscope to see whether Ros-Lehtinen has a "long record of voting against VA backlog fixes." VA backlog We should start by distinguishing between two related, but separate, issues relating to veterans. One concerns longstanding problems with handling benefits claims from veterans, including disability compensation, pensions, and compensation for surviving spouses or children of veterans who die as a result of their service. The other concerns long waits for service at VA hospitals. On the first issue -- benefits -- the backlog refers to requests that go unaddressed by the government for at least 125 days. PolitiFact found that the backlog nearly doubled from roughly 36 percent in the summer 2010 to 65 percent in June 2012. In April 2014, the Obama administration released numbers suggesting the backlog was shrinking, but veterans groups said they had serious doubts about the numbers. The second issue -- the wait for health care -- stemmed from news reports that revealed secret waiting lists at VA hospitals, and that some veterans died while awaiting care. This is what ultimately led to the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki on May 30. The DCCC essentially conflates the two issues in the quest to highlight any vote that portrays Ros-Lehtinen as voting against veterans’ interests. We’ll also offer a general word of warning about how political groups tend to cherry-pick the records of their opponent. It’s possible to dig up a vote made by virtually any member of Congress of either party and claim that the politician is for -- or against -- anything, including veterans benefits. So, just as the Democrats were able to find some votes in which Ros-Lehtinen voted against a service for veterans, spokespersons for Ros-Lehtinen and the National Congressional Campaign Committee were able to point to separate votes in which she voted for veterans’ services. Many of the votes that the DCCC cited were procedural moves or one particular vote out of a series of votes. In most of the instances, the votes broke down overwhelmingly on party lines, with Ros-Lehtinen joining her Republican colleagues. That said, let’s start with the votes that are directly about the backlog: The votes • Veterans Backlog Reduction Act: A bill sponsored by U.S. Rep. William Enyart, D-Ill., ordered the VA to provisionally pay any disability claim if the VA didn’t respond within 125 days. Enyart introduced the bill in April 2013 and it was referred to the House committee on Veterans Affairs. It never received a vote. The DCCC said Ros-Lehtinen voted against considering that bill by pointing to a vote on the "previous question" -- a parliamentary move to force a vote. During a debate about a higher education bill, Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y. stated "if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule that will allow the House to vote on the Veterans Backlog Reduction Act." Enyart then explained his veterans’ bill and urged a "no" vote. His fellow Democrats complied and all voted "no" while the Republicans voted "yes," which defeated his effort. Something the DCCC omitted is that in October 2013, Ros-Lehtinen had voted to establish a commission or task force to evaluate the backlog of disability claims of the Department of Veterans Affairs. That measure passed, 404-1. • Increasing funds to reduce the backlog in disability claims: The DCCC said Ros-Lehtinen voted no, along with nearly every Republican, on a motion that would have added $9.2 million to hire an additional 94 VA claims processors tasked with reducing the disability claims backlog. The June 2013 motion was a "motion to recommit" on an appropriations bill to fund military construction and veterans affairs. A "motion to recommit" in the House refers to a last-ditch attempt by the minority party to amend a bill before it passes. Left unsaid: The overall bill, which did pass, provided money to address the backlog, just not as much as Democrats proposed. • Mental health funds: On June 2, 2011, Congress agreed in a voice vote to set aside $20 million for suicide prevention for veterans. On June 14, 2011, Ros-Lehtinen voted against a Democratic motion to recommit that would add $20 million for veterans’ suicide prevention. The GOP argued that such services were already funded, and the motion failed. Ros-Lehtinen, along with nearly every member of Congress, voted for the overall bill, which increased money for the military. The bill included an additional $20 million for suicide prevention outreach, according to Congressional Quarterly. • Medical and prosthetic research: In May 2012, Ros-Lehtinen joined all but three Republicans in voting against a motion to recommit that would have increased funding for veterans’ medical and prosthetic research by $28.3 million. Here too, Ros-Lehtinen joined the overwhelming majority in passing the overall bill. The bill provided a $1.7 million increase for medical, rehabilitative, health services and prosthetic research -- an amount equal to the Obama administration’s request, according to CQ. The DCCC also cited votes Ros-Lehtinen took leading up to the October 2013 federal shutdown. In August, she voted for a House Republican "continuing resolution" -- a stopgap funding bill -- that the Associated Press reported would "likely result" in the shutdown of the federal government. The bill passed 230-189. The shutdown led to a delay in death benefits for veterans among other delayed services, the Washington Post reported. DCCC also cited a pair of votes Ros-Lehtinen took in September, including one on a motion to commit to H.J. Res. 59, to make continuing appropriations that would have ensured veterans benefits wouldn’t be delayed during a shutdown. All but one Republican voted "no." However, left out of the DCCC’s account is that Ros-Lehtinen voted for in favor of H.J. Res. 72, the "Veterans Benefits Continuing Appropriations Resolution" -- a mini-funding resolution favored by House Republicans to reopen slices of the government. The measure passed the House with unanimous Republican support and overwhelming Democratic opposition. (Showing how both sides play this game, the RNC plucked out that vote to attack DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a claim we rated False.) Democrats also cited multiple other votes including a few that related to housing for veterans but Republicans could point to other votes on bills that did provide housing assistance. Veterans’ groups’ report cards Meanwhile, we found two veterans’ organizations that issue voting "report cards" for members of Congress: • American Veterans (Amvets) gave Ros-Lehtinen an A in 2013, based on eight pieces of legislation. (Ros-Lehtinen didn’t participate in a vote for one.) • Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA) Action Fund gave Ros-Lehtinen a C in 2010. The report card looked at 14 votes, plus whether lawmakers cosponsored certain bills. The group gave her an A in 2008. (Overall, the group gave Congress lower marks in 2010 than 2008.) Contacted by PoilitiFact, DCCC spokeswoman Emily Bittner said, "These Republicans’ votes speak for themselves. Taken in their totality, they show an unfortunate pattern of refusing to cross party lines and vote for commonsense fixes to the problems at the VA." However, we don't think the votes chosen show the "totality" of Ros-Lehtinen's record. Our ruling The DCCC said "Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen has long record of voting against VA backlog fixes." The DCCC points to some votes that went against funding certain veterans’ services or addressing the backlog. However, the DCCC ignores that Ros-Lehtinen took other votes in favor of increasing funding for veterans’ services -- just not as much as Democratic proposals would have offered. The bigger issue is that most of these votes came within elaborate games of tit-for-tat, in which each side offers proposals that they expect will fail, just to get lawmakers on the other side to take votes that look superficially bad. The reality of Ros-Lehtinen’s voting record is much more nuanced than the DCCC’s cherry-picked account would suggest. This, combined with the "A" ratings she's earned from veterans' advocacy groups, undercut the DCCC's claim that she has a "long" voting record of voting against the interests of veterans. We rate the claim False.	None	Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee	None	None	None	2014-06-06T10:37:33	2014-06-02	['None']
pomt-02433	"Crimea became part of Ukraine only in 1954. Crimea was historically part of Russia, and (Nikita) Khrushchev gave it to Ukraine in a gesture that mystified some people."	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/02/david-ignatius/historical-claim-shows-why-crimea-matters-russia/	President Barack Obama has been vocal in his opposition to Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin’s military intervention in Ukraine. Focus has shifted from the new government in Kiev, Ukraine’s capital, to Crimea, a region Russian troops seized control of Saturday. Meanwhile, politicians and pundits are divided over what the United States’ role should be in the conflict. Washington Post columnist David Ignatius criticized Putin’s actions on Face the Nation, saying Ukraine "is not prepared to go backwards" to a Russian regime. He then offered up some context about Crimea’s history. "Crimea became part of Ukraine only in 1954," he said. "Crimea was historically part of Russia, and (Nikita) Khrushchev gave it to Ukraine in a gesture that mystified some people." Ignatius was correct in saying that Ukraine has only controlled the Crimean Peninsula since 1954 -- a claim we also heard from U.S. Rep. Mike Roger, R-Mich., on Fox News Sunday. Not up on your Soviet history? We’ll review the facts. Crimea is an eastern Ukrainian peninsula located on the Black Sea. It’s connected to the rest of the country by a small strip of land. Out of its 2 million residents, about 60 percent identify as Russian. That’s the highest concentration of Russian speakers in Ukraine. Although the territory belongs to Ukraine, Russia stations part of its Black Sea fleet in Sevastopol as part of a pre-existing agreement between the two countries. As Ignatius pointed out, Crimea hasn’t always been part of Ukraine. Here’s a quick rundown of what’s happened in the region since the Ottoman Empire used the peninsula as a hub for slave trade. 1783: Russia annexed Crimea. 1853: The Crimean War began, lasting three years. Russia lost to an alliance of the Ottoman Empire, France, Britain and Sardinia. Crimea remained part of Russia. 1917: Crimea briefly became a sovereign state before becoming a base for the White Army of anti-Bolshevik forces in the Russian War. 1921: The peninsula, now called the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, became part of the Soviet Union. 1942: Nazi Germany took control of Crimea. 1944: Joesph Stalin forcibly deported all Muslim Tatars, a group of 300,000 who had lived on the peninsula for centuries, due to members’ alleged cooperation with Germany during World War II. Many returned to Crimea in the 1980s and 1990s. 1945: After World War II, the autonomous Soviet republic was dissolved and Crimea became a province of the Soviet Union called the Crimean Oblast. 1954: Russian Premier Nikita Khrushchev transferred the Crimean Oblast to Ukraine. It’s often reported that it was a gesture of goodwill from Khrushchev, who had Ukrainian roots. 1991: The Soviet Union collapsed. Many expected President Boris Yeltsin, the new president of the Russian Federation, to take Crimea for Russia. But he didn’t bring it up during negotiations with Ukraine. 1997: Ukraine and Russia signed a treaty that allowed Russia to keep its fleet in Sevastopol. The agreement’s since been extended, so the fleet is set to remain there until at least 2042. As for Ignatius’ claim that Khrushchev’s decision to give Crimea to Ukraine in 1954, we found literature to support that. Slate’s Joshua Keating offered up possible reasons for the land transfer, including the 300th anniversary of Ukraine’s merger with tsarist Russia and Khrushchev’s ties to Ukraine. Though Khrushchev’s gesture had unclear motives, it didn’t seem like a problem for Russia at the time, only garnering a one-sentence write-up in the official Soviet newspaper. It became a bigger issue in the region once the Soviet Union collapsed decades later. So the story of the Crimean Peninsula is long and complicated, to say the least. And there could be more news to come as war threatens Eastern Europe. Today, Crimea’s residents are divided on the issue of Russia’s military intervention. Generally speaking, ethnic Russians support Russia’s involvement in the region, while Tatars and Ukrainians express pro-Ukrainian sentiments. Our ruling Ignatius said Crimea belonged to Russia until 1954, when Khrushchev gave the land to Ukraine, then a Soviet republic. Ignatius’ history lesson explains why Russians remain so intertwined with Crimea and why some Americans are worried that Russians will try to annex the peninsula. We rate Ignatius’ statement True. Correction: About 60 percent of people living in Crimea identify themselves as Russian. An earlier version of this story described the statistic differently.

pomt-04319	"New Jersey is the only state in the union that spent less on higher education than it did at the beginning of the decade."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/oct/28/tom-kean-jr/tom-kean-claims-new-jersey-was-only-state-nation-r/	Republican state Sen. Tom Kean Jr. provided a stark but erroneous statistic comparing New Jersey’s investment in higher education to the rest of the nation. While touring William Paterson University to rally support for a bond referendum on the Nov. 6 ballot, Kean said in the last decade New Jersey was the only state in the country that took money away from higher education. If voters approve the referendum, New Jersey may borrow $750 million to fund construction projects at all of the state’s colleges and universities. "New Jersey is the only state in the union that spent less on higher education than it did at the beginning of the decade," Kean, the Senate minority leader, said to reporters on Oct. 17. "That's unfathomable that over the course of the last decade the state aid to higher education went down." Here, we’ll address Kean’s point that only New Jersey decreased aid over the last decade. On that point, Kean is wrong. The legislator’s spokesman, Adam Bauer, said Kean meant to refer to state appropriations for higher education in the two-year window between fiscal years 2006 and 2008. Over those years, New Jersey was the only state to decrease its aid for higher education, according to a Rutgers University analysis of data from the Grapevine report produced by Center for the Study of Education Policy at Illinois State University. New Jersey’s state tax funds for operating expenses of higher education fell by 0.3 percent in that time frame. As of fiscal year 2010, the Grapevine report has been produced in cooperation with the State Higher Education Executive Officers. According to the State Higher Education Executive Officers data on state and local support available for public higher education operating expenses, New Jersey’s appropriations have increased during the last decade. By that measure, New Jersey’s appropriations increased by 37 percent from 2000 to 2010. Other measures of state support for higher education also show increases of more than 30 percent over the last decade. But what about inflation? Depending on what index you use to adjust for inflation -- the State Higher Education Executive Officers uses an index specifically intended to take into account the increases in costs for colleges and universities -- the amount of the percentage increase in educational appropriations varies, but it is still an increase. The amount of per-student spending is another worthwhile way to compare higher education spending between states, according to experts. The State Higher Education Executive Officers calculates the educational appropriations for each equivalent of a full-time student in constant dollars. New Jersey spent $11,194 by that measure in 2000. By 2010, that amount had dropped to $7,300. But even by that measure, New Jersey’s far from alone. More than 40 states decreased educational appropriations per student over the decade. Our ruling "New Jersey is the only state in the union that spent less on higher education than it did at the beginning of the decade," said Kean. That’s not true. Kean’s spokesman said he intended to refer to the two-year period between fiscal years 2006 and 2008, but over the last decade, the raw numbers show appropriations for higher education in New Jersey have increased. Spending levels per student have decreased over the last decade. But data shows New Jersey is one of dozens of states to cut funding by that measure. We rate this statement False.

pomt-14404	"We understand that this heroin is primarily coming from Mexico, over the border."	true	/ohio/statements/2016/mar/14/rob-portman/most-heroin-us-comes-over-mexican-border/	Ohio Sen. Rob Portman has been busy in Washington touting the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act in response to a shocking number of heroin overdoses in Ohio. The bill just passed in the Senate, 94-1. (Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse was the sole "nay," saying he believes that fighting addiction is a local issue.) Ohio ranks high on the list of states reeling from the national epidemic. In Montgomery County, which encompasses Dayton, Ohio, heroin-related deaths increased 225 percent between 2011 and 2015. Back in the 1970s, the heroin on U.S. streets was the "black tar" variety, and much of it came from southeast Asia. In 2010, 80 percent of the heroin in the world came from poppy fields in Afghanistan, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy. So when Portman said that most of the heroin in America comes from Mexico’s border, we were skeptical. Portman, it turns out, has done his homework. The Drug Enforcement Administration’s National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015 says that Mexico is the primary supplier of heroin to the United States. "Southeast Asia was once the dominant supplier of heroin in the United States, but Southeast Asian heroin is now rarely detected in U.S. markets," the report state. "Mexico and, to a lesser extent, Colombia dominate the U.S. heroin market, because of their proximity, established transportation and distribution infrastructure, and ability to satisfy U.S. heroin demand." The report also says that Mexican "transnational criminal organizations," (the DEA’s term for drug-dealing gangs) "pose the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States; no other group is currently positioned to challenge them." The National Drug Threat report notes that Colombian gangs were traditionally the suppliers of wholesale cocaine and heroin to Mexican and Dominican groups. But cartels in Mexico are ramping up their roles on the supply side -- opium production in Mexico increased by 50 percent in 2014. Mexican labs also produce fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller that is 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine. Fentanyl is sometimes mixed with heroin or substituted for heroin, and the DEA reports more than 700 overdoses attributed to fentanyl between late 2013 and early 2015. Drugs get past the U.S. borders mostly "by land, not by sea," said Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, in the same March 8 hearing with Portman. And a 2015 Washington Post series on the surge of heroin puts the border detection rate at a scant 1.5 percent. Smugglers’ creativity defies gravity: One successful bust came when agents caught two men flying a drone carrying 28 pounds of heroin from Mexico to California. Our ruling Portman said that heroin is coming to the United States primarily from Mexico. He hasn’t been studying drug facts for nothing. We rate this claim True.

pomt-08868	"In 2009, the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council ranked Ohio 11th in the nation and 1st in the Midwest for overall business climate."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2010/aug/04/ted-strickland/ted-strickland-boasts-ohios-small-business-climate/	In the race for governor, the story of the state’s attractiveness to business is a tale of two Ohios. In Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland’s version, the state’s tax laws, location and workforce make it appealing, especially to small businesses. In Kasich’s narrative, Ohio’s tax system and regulations are driving away all businesses. Each cites different studies to help make his case. "In 2009, the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council ranked Ohio 11th in the nation and 1st in the Midwest for overall business climate," the governor said in a July 17 news release. We decided to take a closer look. Strickland, who made the statement in response to a Kasich ad that blamed the governor for Ohio’s jobs losses, was referring to a December 2009 study entitled "Small Business Survival Index 2009: Ranking the Policy Environment for Entrepreneurship Across the Nation." The study was produced by the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, or SBE, a trade group that represents small businesses and advocates for less government regulation. The 2009 study -- the SBE’s 14th survival index -- is a more objective look than say, surveys of CEOs or other business professionals, which do not rely on hard numbers. The SBE rankings evaluate states in 36 categories, including corporate and income taxes, gas and diesel taxes, government spending, health care and energy costs, inheritance taxes, and workers compensation costs. Business and tax experts agree that these are among key factors business owners and entrepreneurs examine when considering where to locate. Ohio does rank 11th overall in the 2009 SBE index. But whether Ohio is No. 1 in the Midwest depends on how you define the Midwest. Strickland relies on the Ohio Business Development Coalition, which supports the state’s economic development efforts. In a news release, it defines the Midwest as Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota. The U.S. Census Bureau defines the Midwest differently. It doesn’t include Kentucky, which lands in the South, but it adds Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota. Ohio still beats them all -- except South Dakota. While Ohio is more likely to compete with nearby states, the Mount Rushmore State’s ranking tops SBE’s entire survey. One reason: South Dakota is among a handful of states without a personal income tax. Small business operators find that attractive because, as the SBE and other groups often point out, about 90 percent of them file taxes as individuals -- sole proprietorships, partnerships and S-Corps -- and don’t pay corporate income taxes. Strickland’s critics like to cite the personal income tax rate, which is high compared to about half of the other states. The conservative Tax Foundation, which Kasich frequently points to, and others say Ohio’s personal income tax, coupled with local taxes, makes the overall tax burden unattractive to business. The Federation of Tax Administrators’ tally of total state and local tax burden ranks 29 states better than Ohio. But the Federation of Tax Administrators warns that state and local tax burden calculations don’t tell the whole story of any business climate. In Ohio, for example, tax reforms begun in 2005 replaced the corporate franchise tax with an activity tax, a move that has made Ohio more attractive to businesses. "What would make that a bad tax would be an increase in its rate," says Thomas Zaino, a tax attorney and Gov. Bob Taft’s state tax commissioner who helped lead the tax reform. "Where Ohio’s tax system is out of kilter with other states is with personal income tax, which includes both state and local and school income tax. We are way out of line." This brings us back the 2009 SBE survey. It looked at Ohio’s top personal income tax rate at the time of 5.925 percent. And it considers both personal and corporate taxes and other categories that reflect the state’s larger narrative about business climate. So while Strickland may overstate Ohio’s Midwest ranking, his claim about the SBE’s rankings is on point and the SBE’s methodology reflects the larger context of the tax debate. We rate Strickland’s claim Mostly True. Comment on this item.	None	Ted Strickland	None	None	None	2010-08-04T12:00:00	2010-07-17	['Midwestern_United_States', 'Ohio']
pomt-01742	"Mitt Romney did not run his campaign on the basis of arguing his experience in the business world was a reason to vote for him."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2014/aug/04/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-mitt-romney-didnt-run-his-busine/	Republican Gov. Scott Walker drew criticism in conservative circles when his campaign TV ads portrayed Democratic rival Mary Burke as an outsourcing profiteer at Trek Bicycle Corp. Walker was asked if the strategy was hypocritical, given that he criticized President Barack Obama’s relentless attacks on 2012 GOP presidential rival Mitt Romney as a greedy outsourcer in his private equity days at Bain Capital. "Fundamentally different," Walker was quoted as saying in the July 24, 2014 Wisconsin State Journal. Walker argued that, "Mitt Romney did not run his campaign on the basis of arguing his experience in the business world was a reason to vote for him. If he had, then I think it would be fair game to say then you need to look at all of his experience." Let’s hit the rewind button. Is Walker right that Romney "did not run his campaign on the basis of arguing his experience in the business world was a reason to vote for him"? Presidential politics, circa 2012 To back up the claim, Alleigh Marré, a Walker campaign spokeswoman, sent us 11 video examples of Romney criticizing Obama and his record, as well as touting his own plans. "The contrast Governor Walker was making between Burke and Romney in the statement you provided is that Romney was running a more robust and dynamic campaign that did not focus solely, or even primarily, on his business experience like Burke’s does," Marré wrote in an email. But Walker did not couch his remark that way; he said Romney didn’t offer his business experience even as "a" reason to support him. That’s a rewrite of history. Romney may have downplayed his tenure as Massachusetts governor. But from start to finish in the campaign, he hammered home his private-sector time, as did campaign surrogates including key Republican officials. A few examples: April 2011: Just 45 seconds into his announcement video, Romney ran through his 25-years-long private-sector resumé and emphasized how it could help him solve America’s economic woes: "I learned how America competes with companies in other countries, why jobs leave and how jobs are created at home." September 2011: "I spent my life in the private sector, not in government," Romney said in Orlando during a GOP primary debate. "I only spent four years as a governor. I didn’t inhale. I’m a business guy." August 23, 2012: Responding to Obama attacks, Romney defended and embraced the lessons of his private-sector years, writing in the Wall Street Journal: "The lessons I learned over my 15 years at Bain Capital were valuable in helping me turn around the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. They also helped me as governor of Massachusetts to turn a budget deficit into a surplus and reduce our unemployment rate to 4.7%. The lessons from that time would help me as president to fix our economy, create jobs and get things done in Washington." August 30, 2012: At the Republican convention, Romney repeatedly used his acceptance speech to talk about the fundamental divide between he and Obama. "He took office without the basic qualification that most Americans have and one that was essential to his task. He had almost no experience working in a business," Romney said. "Jobs to him are about government. I learned the real lessons about how America works from experience." October 2012: In the second presidential debate, Romney cited his real-world work experience to bolster his credibility on tackling complex problems: "I want to make small businesses grow and thrive. I know how to make that happen. I spent my life in the private sector. I know why jobs come and why they go." And that list is just after a cursory review. Finally, we offer one more quote from the 2012 campaign trail: "We know that Mitt Romney had an incredible career in the private sector, turning businesses around that otherwise would have failed, and thousands of people owe their jobs to that today." That was from an introduction of Romney at a Nov. 2, 2012 campaign rally in West Allis. The speaker: Scott Walker. Our rating Walker said that "Mitt Romney did not run his campaign on the basis of arguing his experience in the business world was a reason to vote for him." To the contrary, Romney made frequent and high-profile use of his extensive private-sector credentials, making them the core of his deep and sustained criticism of Obama’s record on handling the economy. Nobody would know that better than Walker, who helped remind voters of nominee’s business-world record. The claim is inaccurate and ridiculous. Pants on Fire.

pomt-12191	"We've achieved a historic increase in defense spending to get our troops the support they so richly deserve."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/27/donald-trump/its-false-trump-achieved-historic-increase-defense/	President Donald Trump ticked off his presidential accomplishments in front of a warm crowd in Youngstown, Ohio, saying he was already keeping his promises to strengthen the military with record defense expenditures. "We've achieved a historic increase in defense spending to get our troops the support they so richly deserve," Trump said at a July 25, 2017, rally organized by his campaign. This isn’t the first time he’s trumpeted big spending for the military. In an address to Congress in March, Trump said his budget "calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history," which we rated Mostly False. His brag in Youngstown is more overblown, and more inaccurate. The White House did not provide information for this fact-check. The increase in defense spending is not historic. Trump’s proposed base spending cap for 2017-18 defense spending is $603 billion, a 9.4 percent increase. There have been 10 years since 1977 when the base level has gone up by more than that, and in some years, the increase more than doubled Trump’s. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan hiked the spending cap by 24.9 percent and by 20.4 percent the following year. More recently, President George W. Bush bumped spending by 10 percent in 2009. The Center for Strategic and International Studies mapped these changes below. Base defense budget doesn’t include war-related funding, though. If we were to include that funding, the statistics are less in Trump's favor. Trump’s proposed budget represents a 5.4 percent increase in the total defense budget, but we’ve also had greater increases in the past. President Jimmy Carter increased military spending by 25 percent in 1981 and President Ronald Reagan’s added another 20 percent the next year. President George W. Bush raised the defense budget by 27 percent in 2003, 13 percent in 2007 and nearly 12 percent in 2008. This time, Trump wasn’t just saying he proposed one of the largest increases; he said he had already "achieved" it. The spending has not yet been approved. To turn his proposal into a reality, Trump will need Congress to appropriate the necessary funding for fiscal year 2018 as well as change the budget caps currently in effect. "Trump’s defense budget is $54 billion above the budget cap already set in law," said Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "And to change the budget cap he needs 60 votes in the Senate, so in some ways it’s actually more difficult to change the budget cap than to pass a health care bill." In Trump’s defense, Harrison said that his proposed defense budget is among the highest in history (though still not the highest) because the proposed increase comes on top of a defense budget that is already high by historical standards. But Trump was talking specifically about an increase. Our ruling Trump said, "We've achieved a historic increase in defense spending to get our troops the support they so richly deserve." The defense spending increase Trump laid out in his 2018 budget is not an unprecedented change, regardless of whether it includes war-related spending. It’s also not the done deal Trump described. In order to actually increase defense spending, Congress will have to appropriate the funding and raise the budget cap. We rate this statement False.

pomt-12975	"Emboldened by election, Texas Republicans kill Medicaid funding for kids with disabilities."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2016/dec/21/if-you-only-news/news-entertainment-service-incorrectly-says-texas-/	In case you missed it, Texas Republicans followed on Donald Trump’s election by wiping out aid to needy children. Except, we confirmed, that's not so. A news-entertainment website, IfYouOnlyNews.com, topped a Dec. 4, 2016, post, later pointed out to us by Facebook, with this headline: "Emboldened by election, Texas Republicans kill Medicaid funding for kids with disabilities." The next day, a debunker for Snopes.com said Republicans had cut some Medicaid funding, but they didn’t do so because they were emboldened by the 2016 general election. And when we emailed IfYouOnlyNews.com inquiring into the basis of its post, especially the headline, we didn’t hear back. Best we could tell, meantime, the site’s story didn’t back up its headline, instead piling on nonfactual wood: "In an all-out assault on the social safety net, Texas Republicans have seized the opportunity to finalize and enact a series of brutal budget cuts." Otherwise, the story drew on a Nov. 28, 2016, Texas news story quoting Carrie Williams, spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, saying the agency would launch the legislated cuts in Medicaid rates starting Dec. 15, 2016, which was several months after the Texas Supreme Court agreed with an appeals court by declining to take up a challenge to the reductions. Plaintiffs had argued the cuts were so steep that providers would have to close their businesses and forgo seeing as many as 60,000 children. Not in the IfYouOnlyNews.com report: Williams further telling the Texas Tribune, "We will monitor the reduction of rates to ensure access to care is not impacted and that Texans around the state receive the much-needed therapies required to improve their lives." To our inquiry, Williams pointed out Rider 50, at the bottom of page II-99 of the 2016-17 state budget, which was passed into law in 2015. The rider directs the commission to reform "reimbursement methodology to be in line with industry standards, policies, and utilization for acute care therapy services while considering stakeholder input and access to care." The rider goes on to say that in each of the fiscal years through August 2017, the agency should achieve at least $50 million in state savings "through rate reductions" plus another $25 million a year through policy changes. But, the rider says, additional rate cuts should be imposed to the degree policy-related savings fall short. Overall, the budget builds in $373 million in reductions in state spending on Medicaid through the two years. For the fiscal year through August 2017, $26 billion in state money was budgeted for Medicaid. Williams also guided us to legislative records showing House and Senate votes on the budget; these show that a few Democrats joined ruling Republicans in voting for the final version of the budget -- including the fee-cut language. News organizations have widely tracked the results of the directive to reduce Medicaid payments to certain in-home child therapists. Those accounts show that no Medicaid funding was entirely killed and also that the reductions put in motion couldn’t have been connected to the November 2016 election results without time-machine trickery. An April 2016 Austin American-Statesman news story quoted state Sen. Jane Nelson, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, saying lawmakers made the reductions based on information showing Texas’ rates had considerably exceeded Medicaid reimbursement rates in other states, a point disputed by some. Nelson, R-Flower Mound, said in 2016: "Forcing Texas taxpayers to accept billing rates that are in some cases double the rates in other states would be a terrible precedent. These are rate adjustments, not reductions in services, and the (budget) rider clearly directs the agency to preserve access to care as we bring these rates to an appropriate level." To our inquiry, Bill Noble, spokesman for the Texas Association for Home Care and Hospice, which opposed the fee reductions, reminded us by email that advocates for providers vigorously challenged the quality of the research behind the fee reductions. An August 2015 American-Statesman news story quoted Jenny Jones, vice president for governmental and public affairs at the Texas A&M Health Science Center, saying she didn’t know if fee data collected by A&M researchers showed Texas therapists were overpaid compared to peers elsewhere; that was the state commission’s interpretation, Jones said. Noble also emailed us a brief association critique of the research stating, in part, that researchers erred by comparing Texas rates for certain services with rates in other states for other services. Debate persists. For instance, Joe Straus, the Republican House speaker, said shortly before IfYouOnlyNews.com posted its story that he expects the House in 2017 to reverse the fee cuts. In a Tribune interview, Straus said the cuts were "well intentioned" but that "maybe they were a mistake." Around the same time, the Texas Conservative Coalition Research Institute, which advises conservative House members, updated its report stating that a reversal of the fee cuts "may not be prudent" given an "overabundance" of therapy providers in the state. Our ruling IfYouOnlyNews.com said: "Emboldened by election, Texas Republicans kill Medicaid funding for kids with disabilities." Cuts sure happened. But this headline claim, not backed up by the accompanying story, fumbles facts. Specifically, the Republican-majority 2015 Legislature requested fee reductions for specific services to certain children with disabilities--not killing all such Medicaid funding. Also, that action occurred more than 17 months before the November 2016 election. We find this claim incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-14375	"Given the results of the primary, the vote of one New Hampshire superdelegate is equal to the votes of about 10,000 grassroots activists."	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/mar/18/new-hampshire-republican-party/nhgop-says-superdelegates-have-power-wipe-out-resu/	After Bernie Sanders’s 22-point victory in New Hampshire in February, his supporters were understandably excited. The Vermont senator was on the road to the nomination, they hoped, racking up most of the state’s delegates. But Sanders’s victory was perhaps less meaningful than it appeared. Thanks to the Democratic Party’s superdelegate system, 712 elected officials and party bigwigs also get a vote at the party convention. That’s some 15 percent of all 4,763 delegates who ultimately pick the nominee, according to CBS News. Unlike pledged delegates, who are selected in the primary, these so-called superdelegates are allowed to back whichever candidate they want. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a party stalwart, has racked up an overwhelming number of endorsements from these superdelegates. A Washington Post story predicted she could ultimately win up to 90 percent of their votes. Even though Sanders won overwhelmingly in New Hampshire, his supporters were baffled and angry to find out that his 15-9 delegate count could actually become 15-17 by convention time, after the state’s eight superdelegates are factored in. Ever ready to needle the opposition party, the New Hampshire Republican Party leaped into the fray, launching an online petition Feb. 15 asking Democratic officials to honor the results of the primary. "Given the results of the primary, the vote of one New Hampshire superdelegate is equal to the votes of about 10,000 grassroots activists," the petition reads, citing some of the big-name superdelegates. "This means that Governor Hassan, Senator Shaheen, the senator’s husband William Shaheen and Congresswoman Kuster are going to cancel out the votes of 40,000 Granite State Democrats." Could one superdelegate vote actually be worth 10,000 ballots cast in the primary? We decided to check it out. It’s important to note that the phrase "grassroots activists" in the statement is imprecise. The rest of the paragraph suggests that it’s being used as a synonym for Democratic voters, but it’s a stretch to call every voter an activist. When we reached out to the state Republican party, spokesman Ryan Williams confirmed "grassroots activists" and "voters" were used interchangeably in this case. And in a statement sent from New Hampshire Republican Party Chairwoman Jennifer Horn about the same time, she correctly used the term voters, and not activists. The actual math involved is simple enough. New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner’s office tallies the total number of votes cast on each side of the primary. On Feb. 9, 2016, his office recorded 254,776 votes on the Democratic side. According to reporting from the Monitor, the state Democratic Party has 24 base delegates to award in the primary. Since he won 60 percent of the vote, Bernie Sanders was awarded 15 delegates, and Hillary Clinton was awarded 9. Simple enough. Enter the superdelegates. There are eight in the state. As the GOP correctly noted, they include Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and her husband, Billy Shaheen; U.S. Rep. Annie Kuster; and Gov. Maggie Hassan. Six of those superdelegates backed Clinton before the primary (sitting out were state Sen. Martha Fuller Clark and party Chairman Ray Buckley). Even after the primary, Fuller Clark and Buckley wouldn’t say who they stood behind, but it’s tradition for the state’s superdelegates to endorse the same candidate. According to a list from the party, the state’s two other superdelegates are Kathleen Sullivan and Joanne Dowdell. So the equation goes like this: Divide the 24 base delegates into the 254,776 ballots cast. Given the total number of voters, each delegate was selected by 10,616 voters. Each Democratic superdelegate, therefore, has an equal weight to more than 10,000 voters. But the superdelegates don’t live in a vacuum. As Buckley told the Monitor, superdelegates are free to change their votes at any time. Since the role was originated in the 1980s, they have never overturned the national consensus for one candidate or another, according to Bloomberg View columnist Jonathan Bernstein. There was concern in 2008, for example, that superdelegates supporting Clinton would tip the balance against then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama. But as Obama racked up primary wins and amassed delegates, he picked up uncommitted and defecting superdelegates. Sullivan, former chairwoman of the state Democratic Party , wrote a column for the Monitor in which she described how the state’s delegation voted in 2008: "At the convention, every superdelegate who had supported Hillary Clinton voted for Barack Obama. It is a New Hampshire tradition: The delegation supports the nominee unanimously." In other words, while many party insiders support Clinton, if Sanders pulls out a come-from-behind win, it’s unlikely that superdelegates would be willing -- or able -- to block him. Our ruling The New Hampshire Republican Party said that "Given the results of the primary, the vote of one New Hampshire superdelegate is equal to the votes of about 10,000 grassroots activists." For starters, "grassroots activists" are not the same as voters, which needed to be clarified. But strictly looking at the numerical breakdown of voters in the Democratic primary and the number of delegates, the math works out. We rate the the claim Mostly True.

pomt-01202	Rhode Island's legislature is "the strongest in the country."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/nov/30/lincoln-chafee/gov-lincoln-chafee-says-ri-legislature-strongest-u/	It’s a statement often heard in the Ocean State: Rhode Island’s state legislature is the strongest in the nation. And it was recently repeated by Governor Lincoln Chafee as he doled out advice to his successor, Governor-elect Gina Raimondo. Chafee was one of several people who were asked by The Journal what advice they would give to Raimondo as she prepares to take office Jan. 6. Their comments were published Nov. 17 in The Journal’s Political Scene column. "The only [advice] I would add is we all know ... that Rhode Island constitutionally has a very strong legislature," Chafee said. "That’s a fact, the strongest in the country … And it’s critical, to move your agenda forward, to have relationships ... build those relationships." Since this claim has been made so often, we decided to check whether Rhode Island’s General Assembly really ranks as the strongest in the nation. We asked Chafee’s office what facts he had to support his statement. It took awhile for his office to get back to us. Meanwhile, we reached out to nearly a dozen political science professors nationwide, the National Conference of State Legislatures, and others to get their views. All who responded generally shared the view that Rhode Island’s governor has relatively limited power compared with governors in many other states We were referred to "Governors and the Executive Branch," a chapter in the book "Politics In The American States: A Comparative Analysis." Its author, Margaret R. Ferguson, a political science professor at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, measured the institutional power of governors in each of the 50 states, based on various factors. Those included term limits; power to appoint without the involvement of the legislature; control over the budget; veto power; and whether the governor is the same political affiliation that controls the state legislature. Rhode Island placed dead last overall in Ferguson’s list for executive power, while Massachusetts placed at the top. The book also noted that Chafee was the only governor in the country in 2011 to face a legislature controlled by an opposing party. At the time, Chafee was registered as an independent; he changed his affiliation to Democrat in May 2013. We also looked to Rhode Island’s Constitution. It limits governors to two terms and specifies that the governor’s appointments of state officers be subject to Senate advice and consent. Pardons, too, need Senate approval. A veto by the governor can be overridden by a vote of three-fifths of members present in the House and Senate. One of the key provisions limiting a Rhode Island governor’s power concerns the state budget. Governors are required to submit budgets, but the documents are then subject to legislative cuts and additions, before the General Assembly passes its own version. In 44 other states, governors have so-called line-item veto authority, the power to reject individual items, while keeping the rest of the budget intact. In Rhode Island, the governor can only approve or veto the final budget, which usually prompts the Assembly to override a veto. When Chafee’s office got back to us, it shared emails sent to the governor’s staff by Peverill Squire, a University of Missouri political science professor who is widely known for his study of state legislatures. The email exchanges were part of the preparations for last year’s 350th anniversary of the Rhode Island Colonial Charter of 1663. "We can always quibble about rankings, but every accounting puts the power of Rhode Island’s governor at or near the bottom in terms of institutional powers," Squire said in an email to Jonathan Stevens, Chafee’s director of special projects. "Rhode Island’s governor enjoys only moderate appointment powers. The governor also has a weak veto and relatively little ability to influence the budget. A line-item veto and greater control over appointments would greatly strengthen the governor." "On a constitutional power metric, Rhode Island is among the most powerful state legislatures," Squire’s wrote. Squire confirmed the statements to PolitiFact Rhode Island via email and cited his book "The Evolution of American Legislatures, Colonies, Territories and States, 1619-2009," as well as an earlier book, "101 Chambers." We also heard from Jay S. Goodman, a political science professor at Wheaton College, who noted that the Rhode Island legislature had given up a certain degree of power over the past 20 years, including the appointment of Supreme Court justices, the revolving door limitations on jobs, ethics rules, and the "separation of powers amendment." Voters approved the separation of powers constitutional amendment in 2004 to curb legislative powers and remove lawmakers from state boards and commissions. "Those changes certainly strengthened the governorship," Goodman said via email. "But the overwhelming one-party rule coupled with iron discipline still makes the Speaker [of the House] the most powerful single person [in Rhode Island]." While the strength of the governorship might appear to be inversely proportional to the General Assembly’s power, Maureen Moakley, a political science professor at the University of Rhode Island, observed that a governor’s force of personality also factors in. She used the late Governor Bruce Sundlun, a Democrat, as an example. "He was a very forceful personality. The day he took office he faced a crisis. [The collapse of Rhode Island’s credit unions.] That gave him a lot of leverage through his administration, especially his first administration," Moakley said. "If a governor has the political savvy to be able to take the bully pulpit and turn [it] into a political force, it can go a long way to mitigating the limitations of the office," Moakley said. Their initial presentation of their agenda is critical, she said. Our ruling Governor Chafee said the Rhode Island state legislature is "the strongest in the country… " Our research found that Rhode Island’s governor has the least institutional power in the nation under the state Constitution. That would make the Rhode Island General Assembly the most powerful, supporting the governor’s point. We rule his claim True.

pomt-13933	"If Question 1 were to pass here in Nevada, we would have more restrictive gun laws here in Nevada dealing with the transfer of firearms than they do in California."	half-true	/nevada/statements/2016/jun/22/robert-uithoven/universal-background-checks-ballot-how-would-nevad/	Two major players in the debate over gun laws are bringing the fight to Nevada, where voters will decide in November on requiring universal background checks on the sale or transfer of firearms. Both the National Rifle Association and Everytown for Gun Safety are dumping millions of dollars into the state in the battle over Question 1. Veteran state Republican operative Robert Uithoven is leading efforts to defeat the measure, and recently criticized the initiative on a public-affairs television program and warned that passing the measure would make Nevada gun laws even more restrictive than its more liberal neighbor — California. "If Question 1 were to pass here in Nevada, we would have more restrictive gun laws here in Nevada dealing with the transfer of firearms than they do in California," he said in a June 6 interview on Nevada NewsMakers. The California/Nevada comparison is becoming a more popular talking point among opponents of the ballot measure, but would Question 1 actually make Nevada stricter than California on gun transfers? The answer isn’t so clear. What’s at stake? So what would Nevada’s proposed background check expansion actually mean for gun owners? If approved by voters, the initiative would create an escalating penalty (starting with a misdemeanor) for people without a license to sell firearms to sell or transfer guns without first going to a licensed dealer and having them conduct a background check. That would be a departure from current state law, where background checks are generally not required for gun sales or transfers between two private parties (lawmakers approved a change waiving fees for voluntary background checks in 2015). Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval vetoed a bill in 2013 that would have enacted a similar background check process on private gun sales and transfers, saying it would impose "unreasonable burdens and harsh penalties" on otherwise law-abiding gun owners. If approved, licensed firearm dealers would be required to conduct the background checks, which is done under the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) and is generally completed fairly quickly (though delays can last up to three days). There are some exceptions built in to the ballot question, including sales and transfers between family members and for antique guns. Temporary transfers without background checks would be allowed in some specific cases, like on certified shooting ranges, in areas where it’s legal to hunt or while in the presence of the gun owner. Debate over the ballot measure echoes the national debate over gun control. Supporters say the majority of background checks are completed quickly and the measure closes an existing loophole, while opponents lambast the measure for being overly vague and unduly burdensome on gun owners. Transfers and Exemptions Approval of Question 1 would turn private party gun sales and transfers in Nevada into a process that would more closely resemble California’s existing system, but there are some differences that would persist between the two states especially in the area of temporary gun transfers, or loans. Uithoven told PolitiFact that California generally allows people "who are personally known to each other" to infrequently loan firearms for up to 30 days as long as the recipient has a valid firearm safety certificate and the loan is for a "lawful purpose." California also has exemptions for transfers as gifts, on gun ranges, for use as props in the entertainment industry, loans to minors under certain requirements and for licensed hunters during hunting season(though California lawmakers are debating rolling back several of the exemptions including the 30-day infrequent loans). Because the Nevada ballot measure don’t allow for a "temporary" transfer, or loan, between friends unless the gun owner is in the physical presence of the person handling the gun or under a several clearly stated, well-defined situations (like on a shooting range or legal hunting area), Uithoven says the new law would be stricter than what California requires. The ballot measure does have a broader definition of "immediate family member," as California only includes transfers between parents, children, and grandparents as exempt from transfer regulations. Question 1 broadens those family exemptions in Nevada and includes "parents, children, siblings, grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews." So California is stricter on which family members fall under the inter-family gun transfers label, but as Uithoven points out, the state does have an easier process for "infrequent" firearms loans (less than six times per calendar year) to people who are "personally known to each other," which could include friends or other family members. But those "infrequent transfers" still require firearm transferees to have completed the state’s Firearm Safety Certificate course, which is a $25 written test on firearm safety and general gun laws. That’s a regulatory hurdle that doesn’t exist in Nevada, with or without the ballot measure. As for any other non-familial transfers that don’t fall under exemptions, California is generally stricter than a post-Question 1 Nevada. So-called "private party transfers" in California require a proof-of-residency requirement, a safe handling demonstration requirement and a mandatory ten-day waiting period, whereas the Nevada proposal would only require passing a background check. Uithoven also says that the ballot measure allows licensed firearms dealers to ask for an undefined "reasonable fee" to conduct the background check, while California has a set dollar amount written into the state’s penal code. We also reached out to the pro-Question 1 Background Checks Initiative, who highlighted a handful of California regulations that Nevada would lack. California also has an "assault weapons" ban, which includes a ban on private sales or transfers of so-called assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Nevada has no such ban. The state has several additional regulations on private party gun sales compared to the proposed Nevada changes, but not all of them directly relate to firearm transfer rules. California generally requires a 10-day waiting period for any gun sale or transfer, including private party sales and transfers (though it’s being challenged in court). Again, this regulation doesn’t apply to the exempted transfers. California also prohibits buyers from purchasing more than one handgun in a 30-day period, but that’s only for retail sales — private party transfers are exempt. Our ruling NRA Nevadans for Freedom campaign manager Robert Uithoven said passing Question 1 would lead to "more restrictive gun laws here in Nevada dealing with the transfer of firearms than they do in California." Passing the ballot question would make Nevada look a lot more like California in terms of private party gun sales and transfers, with generally fewer regulations. Uithoven’s claim focuses specifically in on the process of firearm transfers. In some ways, Nevada’s law would be tougher, but in other ways it would not. Overall, California would have more regulations on firearm transfers if Question 1 passes but would be more lenient in exempting certain types of gun transfers. Uithoven’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important context. We rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/58d554fc-0594-4176-8f93-379390f58bf5	None	Robert Uithoven	None	None	None	2016-06-22T16:23:14	2016-06-06	['Nevada', 'California']
pomt-07767	In 2009, Democratic Wisconsin state senators "rammed through a billion-dollar tax hike in 24 hours with no public input."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/23/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-democratic-senator/	The Badger State’s old tourism slogan, "Escape to Wisconsin," is a come-hither aimed largely at the Land of Lincoln. But when the political temperature got too hot in Madison on Feb. 17, 2011, 14 Democratic senators escaped to Illinois and helped put Wisconsin somewhere near the center of the political universe. The absence of the 14 made it impossible for the Senate to get a quorum for a vote on Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s budget-repair bill. The senators said they fled because the bill -- which would strip away most collective bargaining rights from most public employees -- was being rushed to a vote. Two days later, Walker called on them to return, suggesting in a statement that they were being hypocritical. "These are many of the same senators who, two years ago, rammed through a billion-dollar tax hike in 24 hours with no public input," Walker declared. Walker repeated the call for the Senate Democrats to return in his televised "fireside chat" on Feb. 22, 2011, about the budget stalemate. And numerous readers have asked us to sort out this piece of the debate. So we will. We asked Walker’s spokesman, Cullen Werwie, to explain the governor’s charge. He said the reference was to a budget-repair bill introduced by Walker’s predecessor, Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, in 2009. The content of Doyle’s and Walker’s repair bills -- which were needed midyear to balance the state budget -- are different, but the scenarios are similar. The Doyle bill was approved by a Democratic-controlled Legislature under a Democratic governor. Conversely, Republican Walker introduced his bill to an Assembly and Senate that are controlled by the GOP. (Ironically, the Wisconsin 14 fled two years to the day after the Doyle bill was introduced.) Walker’s statement has three major points: Who was involved Walker is correct in saying "many of the same senators" who retreated to Illinois voted for Doyle’s 2009 budget-repair bill. Indeed, 12 of the 14 did; the only two who didn’t, Tim Cullen of Janesville and Chris Larson of Milwaukee, weren’t elected until November 2010. What the bill involved Was the Doyle bill "a billion-dollar tax hike"? We found in a previous PolitiFact Wisconsin item that assessed the bill and how it was adopted that taxes, per se, would only be raised by an estimated $290 million. However, if a new fee on hospital revenue was included -- and news reports often referred to the fee as a tax -- the take would be an estimated $1.2 billion over three years. Doyle and Democrats argued the change was welcomed by hospitals and allowed the hospitals to bring in a greater amount in federal money. But it was real money filling a real hole. So, Walker’s claim of a billion-dollar tax hike is essentially accurate. How it was adopted Was Doyle’s bill "rammed through" in "24 hours with no public input"? Again, Walker is essentially correct. No public hearing was held on Doyle’s bill, which was approved by the Legislature the day after it was introduced. As Walker suggested, the Senate vote was strictly along party lines, with all Democrats voting for the bill and all Republicans voting against it. (In the Assembly, all but two Democrats voted yes and all Republicans voted no.) This is one budget-repair bill debate we can bring swiftly to a close. Accused by Senate Democrats of rushing a vote on his repair bill, Walker fired back with his own charge. He said that two years earlier, many of those senators had rammed through a billion-dollar tax hike contained in a Democratic repair bill -- in 24 hours and without public input. The record is clear. We rate Walker’s statement True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2011-02-23T15:45:16	2011-02-19	['None']
pomt-07500	"Libya supplies the oil for China. We get no oil from Libya."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/11/donald-trump/libya-sells-most-its-oil-europe-not-china/	Donald Trump has said he’s thinking about running for president, and while he’s gotten a lot of attention for questioning President Barack Obama’s birth certificate, he’s also made several provocative statements about foreign policy. In an interview on Fox News, Trump discussed the Middle East, starting out with the war in Iraq, then moving on to U.S. air strikes in Libya. "You know in the old days, when you won a war, to the victor belongs the spoils. You kept it," Trump said. "We win a war, and we hand it over to some people we don't know and we leave." "And we lose the contracts to China," interjected one of the Fox anchors. "Yes, China will be another one," Trump agreed. "By the way, Libya supplies the oil for China. We get no oil from Libya. What are we doing?" We thought Trump’s statement about Libya and China was interesting, so we decided to look into it. We asked a Trump spokesman for comment, but we didn't hear back. So we turned to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), a federal agency that collects data on energy. We’ll take Trump’s statement in two parts. • Libya supplies the oil for China. Libya does supply some oil to China, but it’s not as large as Trump’s statement implies. The EIA showed that Libya’s No. 1 customer is Italy, which bought 28 percent of Libya’s exports in 2010. Italy was followed by France, at 15 percent, then China, at 11 percent. After that, Libya sold to Germany, 10 percent; Spain, 10 percent; Greece, 5 percent; the United Kingdom, 4 percent, and United States, 3 percent. (More on that 3 percent in a bit.) Other countries combined to buy 14 percent of Libya’s exports. We also wanted to know what share of China's imported oil comes from Libya. We found that in 2009, China bought most of its imported oil from Saudi Arabia, which supplied 21 percent. That was followed by Angola, 16 percent; Iran, 11 percent; Russia, 8 percent; Sudan, 6 percent; Oman, 6 percent; Iraq, 3.5 percent; Kuwait, 3.5 percent and then Libya at 3.1 percent. Libya is followed by Kazakhstan at 2.9 percent and Venezuela at 2.6 percent. Other countries combined supplied 17.4 percent of China’s imports. So China is a big customer of Libyan oil, but not the biggest, and there are many other customers. And Libya is far from being China’s chief supplier. It ranks ninth. • We get no oil from Libya. The United States doesn’t get much oil from Libya. In 2010, the U.S. imported 25.7 million barrels of oil from Libya, down from a recent high of 42.8 million barrels in 2007. The U.S. didn’t import any oil from Libya between 1982 and 2004, due to an oil embargo first imposed by President Ronald Reagan. Libya is such a small source that it doesn’t make it into the list of the top 15 countries from which the United States imports oil. U.S companies are working to develop Libya’s oil sector, however. In 2009, a deputy assistant secretary of state told Congress that U.S. companies are "probably the most active and the most successful" in helping Libya revitalize its oil sector. "They're seeking our technology because it's the best in the world and we're doing quite well," said the U.S. State Department’s William Hudson. "The Chinese are also active, but our companies have really taken the lion's share so far of bidding on plots for oil production." Trump said, "Libya supplies the oil for China. We get no oil from Libya." His point in the first sentence was clearly that Libya was a major supplier of oil for China. But the data do not support his claim. Libya is far from being China’s chief supplier. It ranks ninth. The second part of his statement is false -- the U.S. does get oil from Libya and the percentage is likely to increase.. On the whole, we rate Trump’s statement False.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2011-04-11T17:12:09	2011-04-04	['Libya', 'China']
pomt-14380	"Six justices" on the U.S. Supreme Court have been "confirmed in presidential election years since 1912."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/17/mike-honda/mike-honda-shares-accurate-graphic-about-past-supr/	In a Medium post titled, "It’s Time for the Senate to Do Its Job," Rep. Mike Honda, D-Calif., urged senators to hold a vote on President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland. Virtually since the moment it was announced that Justice Antonin Scalia had died, Democrats and Republicans have clashed over when he should be replaced. Senate Republicans have so far held firm in saying they will not vote on the nomination until the public weighs in after Election Day 2016. Democrats counter that this is out of step with Senate norms, and they have created a graphic to make that case. "Let’s give President Obama’s #SCOTUSnominee a fair hearing and timely vote," the graphic says. At the top of Honda’s March 16 Medium post is a graphic created by the House Democratic Caucus. Under the title, "6 justices confirmed in presidential election years since 1912," the graphic shows photographs of all six justices who fit that description. Is it accurate? Of the six examples cited in the graphic going back to 1912, five were both nominated and confirmed during a presidential election year. They are summarized in the following chart. (We’ve corrected the spelling of Clarke’s name, which is incorrect in the Democrats’ graphic). The sixth case involves a future justice who was nominated prior to an election year but was confirmed during one. Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, who’s still on the court, was confirmed in February 1988, but President Ronald Reagan, a Republican, had nominated him in November 1987 to succeed the retiring Louis Powell. It’s worth noting that in June 1968, five months before the presidential election, Democratic President Lyndon Johnson made two nominations, though there was not technically a vacancy, and neither were approved. Johnson nominated Abe Fortas, who was a sitting justice, to succeed Earl Warren as chief justice, after Warren indicated he wanted to retire. Fortas hit strong opposition in the Senate Judiciary Committee and in the face of a filibuster, he asked that his name be withdrawn. (The hearings uncovered questionable speaking fees Fortas received, and he resigned from the court in 1969.) Johnson had also nominated Homer Thornberry to take Fortas’ place on the court. But that nomination, too, was withdrawn, since Fortas was never elevated. Finally, in October 1956, Republican President Dwight Eisenhower did something even more extraordinary than making a nomination less than a month before election day. He put William Brennan directly on the court with a "recess appointment" to replace Sherman Minton. He then formally nominated Brennan in January 1957. Our ruling The graphic Honda used said that "six justices" on the U.S. Supreme Court have been "confirmed in presidential election years since 1912." That is correct, so we rate the statement True.

pomt-10568	"One man sacrificed for his country. One man opposed a flawed strategy in Iraq. One man had the courage to call for change. One man didn't play politics with the truth. One man stands up to the special interests."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/07/john-mccain/one-man-found-his-winning-message/	In advance of the Potomac Primary on Feb. 12, 2008, Republican front-runner John McCain released a TV ad in Virginia, the District of Columbia and Maryland that has played to other markets in this primary process. "Never Surrender" is a 30-second spot that shows images of Sen. McCain as a prisoner of war, walking alongside Ronald Reagan and on the campaign trail. Its claims are well supported. • "One man sacrificed for his country." McCain served 22 years in the U.S. Navy, including five as a prisoner of war after his plane was shot down in Vietnam. He has been honored with the Silver Star, Bronze Star, Legion of Merit, Purple Heart and the Distinguished Flying Cross. Of his remaining Republican contenders, only Rep. Ron Paul has military experience. He served as a medical doctor in the U.S. Air Force from 1963 to 1965 in San Antonio, Texas, and in the U.S. Air National Guard from 1965 to 1968. He did not go to war as McCain did. That appears to be the distinction drawn here. ( Read our fact sheet on "Who was in the military?" here. ) • "One man opposed a flawed strategy in Iraq. One man had the courage to call for change. One man didn't play politics with the truth." Although he has been one of the Senate's strongest and most vocal advocates of the war in Iraq, leading recent debates against Democratic bills to set a timetable for withdrawal, McCain has also been one of the Bush adminstration's biggest Republican critics. As far back as mid 2003, shortly after the invasion of Iraq, McCain was warning that the United States needed to send more troops to Iraq and more money to Iraq reconstruction efforts, or else face a deep and long-lasting insurgency that would threaten America's mission there. Which, of course, is exactly what has happened. He was also a strident critic of former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, telling interviewers that he lacked confidence in Rumsfeld as far back as 2004 — meaty criticism for a top Republican on the Armed Services Committee. "There's not enough (troops), and we are in a very serious situation, in my view, a race against time. We need to spend a whole lot more money to get the services back to the people. We need to get the electricity going, the fuel, the water. And unless we get that done and get it done pretty soon, we could face a very serious situation," McCain told NBC's Meet the Press on Aug. 24, 2003. "Time is not on our side. People in 125-degree heat with no electricity and no fuel are going to become angry in a big hurry. The sophistication of the attacks on U.S. and allied troops have increased. And what we do in the next several months will determine whether we're in a very difficult situation or not, and there's still time, but we've got to act quickly." As for his claim that just "one man" opposed the strategy in Iraq, that's a bit of a stretch: Independent experts and many congressional Democrats have lavished criticism on the administration's strategy in Iraq. But among his Republican competitors for the presidential nomination, McCain is right. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has suggested that he, too, would take a different route in Iraq than the president, but McCain was clearly there first. • "One man stands up to the special interests." This is a reference to McCain's strong opposition to what he calls wasteful pork barrel spending and earmark projects. Taxpayers for Common Sense, a Washington-based group that watches for such things, says McCain holds the title of pork-fighter and has honored him with its "Treasury Guardians" award. Overall, it's an effective TV ad with accurate claims. We give it a True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-02-07T00:00:00	2008-02-06	['Iraq']
pomt-08335	Company may close, "all because government essentially says if they don't hire a lifeguard to watch their workers, they can't stay open."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/oct/28/jeff-brandes/jeff-brandes-says-government-regulations-may-close/	In a television ad, Republican Jeff Brandes touts his ability to save jobs in Florida House District 52 with the story of a boat cleaning company threatened with closure by over-the-top government regulation. "Small business is where the jobs are, like a 30-year-old boat cleaning business employing 18 people," Brandes says as he stands near a pier. "But their jobs are on the line, all because government essentially says if they don't hire a lifeguard to watch their workers, they can't stay open. Even when the water's only a few feet deep." The screen flashes briefly to the words "Government: Do it our way or else." But is the government really forcing a business to hire a lifeguard or shut down? The case in question involves Scuba Clean Inc., a St. Petersburg company that earlier this year was cited for 19 violations by the U.S Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The company faces more than $200,000 in penalties. OSHA did indeed demand that the company hire a trained tender, someone to stand watch over divers for safety, and the fine for that violation is $49,000. A tender is generally similar to a lifeguard but with much more extensive training. Owner Phil Secord disputed the violations and contested the fines, but said he is closing his company over the citations. He laid off at least one worker, and turned over his customers to others who work as contract workers, he said. The three most serious fines stemmed from allegations that the company had workers in the water who weren't trained under the standards for commercial diving, and for using air through a line from the surface without a tender. However, there were 16 other unrelated violations alleged, including the company not having a supervisor on site, not having written safety procedures and equipment, and improper storage of chlorine and other chemicals. Secord said the government is indeed killing him with unneeded regulation. For example, he said his divers mostly clean boats in waters four to six feet deep at local marinas. Therefore, he said, employing a tender would be unnecessary and expensive. His case is headed to a Nov. 5 settlement hearing. It is true that OSHA rules don’t discriminate between people cleaning boat hulls in shallow water and commercial divers who work in deep water to do underwater construction, according to commercial diving trainers. "It's not a gray area. It's cut and dry. And it's a federal regulation," said Geoff Thielst, a 30-year commercial diver and program director of marine technology training at Santa Barbara City College. But Brandes said the business was threatened "all because" Scuba Clean didn't hire a lifeguard – the tender. The bulk of the alleged violations and fines that have put this business' future in doubt involved training of divers, equipment and safety practices, not just the absence of a lifeguard. Therefore, we rule this claim Half True.	None	Jeff Brandes	None	None	None	2010-10-28T15:57:51	2010-09-26	['None']
pomt-14110	If you don't buy cigarettes at your local supermarket, your grocery bill won't go up a dime. The same is true of the sugary drink tax. If passed, you can avoid paying the tax by not buying sugary drinks.	half-true	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/may/11/philadelphia-daily-news/rating-philly-daily-news-claim-its-not-grocery-tax/	According to the monied interests fighting Mayor Jim Kenney’s proposed tax on sugary beverages, it’s not really a "soda tax." It’s a "grocery tax." This coalition of unions, businesses and others has released ads with the slogan "No Philly Grocery Tax," and last week held a rally outside of City Hall with beverages on a replica of grocery store shelves. Last month, the Daily News criticized the linking of the soda tax to a grocery tax in an editorial titled "Soda tax would benefit kids, which is why we support it." After discussing the anti soda tax group’s ads’ insistence on referring to the tax as a grocery tax, the editorial read, "If you don’t buy cigarettes at your local supermarket, your grocery bill won’t go up a dime. The same is true of the sugary drink tax. If passed, you can avoid paying the tax by not buying sugary drinks." Their criticism of the phrase "grocery tax" has been one of many. But will the prices of groceries be untouched by the proposed soda tax? Or is there a possibility grocery bills could increase even if consumers stop buying soda? Sandy Shea, the Daily News’ editorial page editor, stressed that the newspaper’s editorial board is convinced that calling the sugary drinks tax a grocery tax is disingenuous. "If you don’t buy sugary drinks in a supermarket," Shea said, "it’s not a grocery tax." As city officials have stressed, the three-cent-per-ounce soda tax is levied on distributors. From there, at least some of it will likely be passed through to the retail level. The owners of supermarkets, drugstores, corner stores or whatever businesses sell sugary beverages can choose to absorb the cost, or pass it onto the consumer. While most talk has centered on the possibility of rising soda prices, experts and research suggest it’s possible these businesses could raise the prices of other items similar to sugary drinks. Donald Marron, director of economic policy initiatives at the Urban Institute, said the prices of diet soda and pure juices might increase because demand for them could increase as people searched for alternatives to sugary beverages. But he doubted the increase would extend to items unrelated to the sugary drinks tax. "The question you always have to ask yourself is why would these stores be able to raise the price of these other goods," Marron said. "And if they’re able to why wouldn’t they already? If that were the profitable thing to do, they ought to raise the price of cereal anyway." In Berkeley, the only American city to enact a soda tax, researchers noted the price of Diet Coke increased by an average of .32 cents per ounce (regular sodas saw increases in the range .5 to .7 cents per ounce). They saw no significant increase in other diet sodas. Carl Davis, research director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said it was possible the prices of other products would rise but not probable in most circumstances. He said smaller convenience stores would be more likely to raise prices on other products than larger grocery stores because they likely take in a greater share of revenue from soda sales. Still, they’d face limitations on how much they could increase prices of other goods given the lack of variety of items they sell and the need to keep profit margins high on soda if soda is a major revenue generator for them. "All that said, this soda tax proposal is novel enough that any answer to this question is going to involve some amount of speculation," he said. Last month in a 6ABC story, it seemed Mayor Kenney was suggesting other items could rise in price because of the soda tax. The station paraphrased the mayor like this: "The mayor said he believes the increased costs will be spread over thousands of retail items." Lauren Hitt, Kenney’s communications director, said the station’s paraphrase was incorrect: "He was referring to the supermarket’s ability to absorb the tax. I believe he was asked to respond to supermarket’s claim that they can’t absorb the increase in cost (if distributors pass it on) because they say they don’t make that much of a profit on soda. He responded by pointing out that because supermarkets sell so much more than just soda that they can absorb the price as part of their overall profits from all the different products they sell." Asked why the phrase grocery tax is being used, Philadelphians Against the Grocery Tax Coalition spokesperson Larry Miller pointed to a list of taxed products on their website. These products range from sodas to energy drinks to fruit juices that are not 100 percent natural. "Would you consider, let’s say, Minute Maid premium tropical punch a grocery item?" Miller said. "Would you consider Cranberry Ocean Spray cherry juice? Ocean Spray pomegranate? These are grocery items. Snapple Grape. These are all grocery items that people buy every day at the grocery store or the supermarket." Our Ruling In an editorial supporting the soda tax and condemning the use of the phrase grocery tax, the Daily News wrote Philadelphians would avoid the tax by not purchasing sugary beverages. Evidence, experts and studies say it’s possible a sugary drinks tax on distributors could lead to some rising prices elsewhere. But there’s not enough data and there’s also a chance those who don’t buy sugary drinks will bear some of the cost of the tax. We rule the claim half true.

Another fake news site, Info Media, published an identical article that cites The Last Line of Defense as a source at the bottom. Popular News Today published a fake article on Nov. 6 that added a plot twist to the original fake news story: "BREAKING: Cop who arrested Malia Obama found dead under suspicious circumstances." None of this is true. The Last Line of Defense is a satirical site that tries to fool conservatives into clicking on false headlines. The author’s work, which we’ve debunked before, often ends up on other fake news sites. Beyond the site’s disclaimer, there are many other ways to show the story is fake. The article says that Malia Obama, and nine other Harvard students, attacked an elderly woman. The Cambridge Police Department daily log, an overview of the department's daily calls for service, does not mention an attack involving 10 assailants, Antifa or any of the names listed in the fake news article. The department’s News & Alerts page also does not have a post announcing the death of an Officer Patrick Farley, Malia’s fake arresting officer.

pomt-07628	Says it has offered $12 million in savings through 2011 and $184 million in savings over the next 25 years in contract negotiations with the City of Milwaukee.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/18/milwaukee-police-association/milwaukee-police-association-says-it-has-offered-s/	After the Green Bay Packers won the Super Bowl in February 2011, news in Wisconsin centered on Gov. Scott Walker’s attempt to curtail the collective bargaining powers of most government workers and make those workers pay more for their benefits. Only police and other public safety employees were exempted. Yet on March 7 and 9, 2011, the Milwaukee Police Association ran a half-page ad in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel touting how the union had offered to make financial sacrifices worth millions of dollars. The reference was to contract talks between the union -- which represents 1,700 officers, detectives and other police employees -- and the City of Milwaukee. MPA offered $12 million "in immediate savings through 2011" and $184 million in savings "over the next 25 years," the ad announced. The claims were recited the next day in a news release issued by Milwaukee Ald. Bob Donovan. Let’s see if they’re true. Contracts for Milwaukee police and firefighters expired in 2009. Both unions are in mediation with the city over contracts that would be retroactive to January 2010 and continue through December 2011. Mayor Tom Barrett, who lost to Walker in the November 2010 gubernatorial election, asked the unions in March 2011 to agree to pay more for pensions and health insurance, as called for in Walker’s budget-repair bill. MPA president Mike Crivello said at the time his union would consider the request -- and he reiterated the concessions that MPA had already offered. That is, the $12 million in savings through 2011 and the $184 million over the next 25 years. There are quite a few figures, but hang us with us; we’ll walk through the three main ways the union claims the money will be saved. Pay freeze for 2010 and 2011 The ad says a two-year pay freeze would save the city $5.4 million per year. But Crivello acknowledged the ad is in error on this point and that $5.4 million would be the total savings through 2011, the two-year period of the contract. Where did the number come from? MPA arrived at the figure by assuming -- based on raises in newly-signed police contracts around the country -- that an arbitrator would award 2.5 percent raises for 2010 and 2011 if the union and the city could not agree on a contract, according to MPA vice president Mark Buetow. Let’s pause here for some perspective. First, the union assumes raises would be virtually automatic. But there is no way to know what an arbitrator would decide. Second, avoiding 2.5 percent pay raises through a pay freeze may be a figurative savings of $5.4 million for the city, but it’s not a literal savings. With a pay freeze, the city would still be spending as much on payroll as it does today. Reduced wage for training The ad says the city would save $1.04 million per year through a "reduced wage for training." That would be a total of $2.08 million through 2011. Crivello said the union would accept a reduced starting wage for new officers for the nearly six months they spend in training before hitting the streets. The $2.08 million in savings is based on the city hiring 200 new recruits per year. But that 200 is a big if. Crivello said 200 new hires would give the department roughly the number of officers that have been authorized as part of the city budget. But he acknowledged that the city commonly keeps roughly that many police positions vacant. Troy Hamblin, the city labor negotiator, said the city has hired an average of 79 police recruits per year since Barrett was elected mayor in 2004. Based on that number, he said the lower training wage would save the city $1.09 million through 2011 -- about half the union’s estimate. So, the union is banking on the city more than doubling its usual police hiring in order for the $2.08 million through 2011 to be saved. A more realistic number would be about half that. Those aspects relate directly to the immediate savings. The next is the central part of the claim of saving $184 million over 25 years. New hire pension contributions The newspaper ad says that if new hires make contributions to their pensions -- current employees represented by MPA make none -- the city would save $184 million "over the next 25 years." That’s an awful specific number, and 25 years is a long time away. Where did the figure come from? The union says the estimate -- based on today’s payroll -- is for what the annual savings would be 25 years from now. That is, the amount saved each year, once we are 25 years into the future. Why 25 years in the future? Since contracts allow police officers to retire after 25 years on the job, by that point nearly the entire force would be under the new provisions. (The city’s estimate, using that measure is $179 million in savings a year, based on today’s payroll. So, the two sides are not far off.) That may seem clear enough. But the wording in the ad -- savings "over the next 25 years" -- is confusing. We read it as the total amount saved during the course of those 25 years and think most others would as well. That figure is even harder to calculate, since it depends on how many officers retire or leave the force and at what point; how rapidly those officers are replaced and what happens to their salary in the meantime. Indeed, by that measure, the overall savings is likely much higher. The annual savings would grow as the force shifts over time from most being under the current no-contribution system, to most being under the new approach. Of course, the numbers in the short term on this point are stronger. As for the immediate savings in the contract, Crivello said that if new hires paid 7 percent of their base wage toward their pensions, the city would save $432,000 through 2011 (the city’s estimate is $462,000, so there is not a big disagreement on this one either). All right, let’s tally the estimated savings from the three areas to see if they back up the two major claims in the union ad. Those were the ones in large, bold print: $12 million through 2011 and $184 million "over the next 25 years." $12 million through 2011: Savings from a pay freeze are figurative, based on forgoing an assumed pay raise. The city’s payroll costs would actually remain flat, so there would be no direct savings to the budget. The reduced training wage would save the city about $2.08 million and pension contributions would save $432,000 -- both according to union estimates. That’s a total of $2.51 million (the city’s estimate is $1.55 million). And that’s a fraction of the $12 million claimed. So, the first of the ad’s two claims is wrong. $184 million "over the next 25 years": This claim focuses on the pension change. The city doesn’t quarrel much with the dollar estimate, which is an annual savings using today’s dollars. But it’s a figure that wouldn’t be reached until the entire workforce turns over, perhaps 25 years from now. There would be savings in the interim years, tallying over the intervening 25 years even more than that amount -- but no one knows how much. So, the second claim may actually be low, but it is also off -- potentially way off. One final note. An asterisk at the bottom of the ad says MPA offered the three concessions "in exchange for non-monetary and monetary items." In other words, it’s clear that the union would only make the three concessions if it gets something in return. MPA estimates the monetary items -- including higher life insurance benefits and higher pay for certain officers -- would cost the city less than $1 million per year, Buetow said. The city has not produced a complete estimate, but Hamblin said the union estimate appears reasonable. So, that would further reduce the savings claimed in the MPA ad. Time for the Truth-O-Meter. The Milwaukee Police Association said concessions it offered in contract talks with the City of Milwaukee would save taxpayers $12 million through 2011 and $184 million "over the next 25 years." A proposed pay freeze would affect current employees, but wouldn’t save the city any money, while changes in training pay and pensions would save money but affect only new hires. The savings through 2011 would be, using union estimates, $2.51 million -- a far cry from $12 million. On the second point, the MPA is correct there would be about $184 million in savings … in the 25th year. But the wording in the ad refers to the savings during that entire time frame. So this number is also off -- apparently by a lot. The MPA’s case would actually be stronger if they used a more accurate number, since during the previous 24 years the annual savings would ramp up until it reaches that projected $184 million in year in year 25.

pomt-14359	"More people were killed by terrorists in 2015 than in any other year ever, after an 80 percent increase from 2014."	mostly true	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/mar/22/joe-pitts/rep-joe-pitts-said-2015-saw-80-increase-people-who/	Rep. Joseph Pitts, a Republican whose district encompasses Reading and Lancaster, used a recent Medium post to highlight the number of people killed by terrorists worldwide as he advocated for the continued usage of the U.S.’s Guantanamo Bay facility. The post, published at the end of February, opened with this statement: "More people were killed by terrorists in 2015 than in any other year ever, after an 80 percent increase from 2014." That seemed like a large increase, so we decided to check the claim. After an inquiry from PolitiFact, Pitts’ chief of staff Monica J. Volante said the statement should have read, "More people were killed by terrorists in 2014 than in any other year ever, after an 80 percent increase from 2013." So the actual statement is one year off. When the years in the statement are corrected, and based on that source, this appears to check out. The 2015 Global Terrorism Index published by the Australia-based Institute for Economics and Peace has, for the last three years, compiled information on terrorist activity dating back to 2000. It data comes from figures provided by the Global Terrorism Database hosted at the University of Maryland. The 111-page report states that 2014 was the deadliest on record worldwide, and 32,658 people died as a result of terrorism, representing an 80 percent jump from 2013 when about 18,000 people were killed. That increase is the largest yearly increase in the last 15 years, according to the report. The 2014 figure also represents a nine-fold increase compared to the number of people killed by terrorism worldwide in 2000. However, Pitts used the statement -- though the years were incorrect on first blush -- to segue into his views on keeping the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay open, where about 90 terrorism suspects are held on the southern tip of Cuba. President Obama has long called for the closure of the prison and in February released a plan to transfer the remaining detainees to other facilities, including ones in the United States. Pitts’ Medium post focused largely on threats from terrorist groups Al-Qaeda and ISIS. But the Global Terrorism Index that was the basis of his initial claim reports that most deaths were by Boko Haram, an Islamic extremist group based in Nigeria. In other words, those attacks have little to do with the argument Pitts builds upon: Proof that the U.S. should keep the detention center at Guantanamo Bay open. Nigeria saw the largest increase in terrorist deaths ever recorded in 2014 with 7,512 fatalities, a 300 percent increase from the year prior. Boko Haram accounted for 6,644 deaths and ISIS was responsible for 6,073. According to the Global Terrorism Index that Pitts’ office cited, much of the terrorism didn’t directly affect the United States. Of the deaths worldwide in 2014, 78 percent were concentrated in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria. However, of the countries classified in the report as "the West," the United States had the most deaths from terrorism in 2014, with 18 deaths and 19 attacks. Of those, all but five were committed by individuals and were, according to the report, "largely motivated by right wing extremism or white supremacists." Our ruling The initial claim made by Pitts says, "More people were killed by terrorists in 2015 than in any other year ever, after an 80 percent increase from 2014." While his office corrected those years to 2014 and 2013, respectively, to PolitiFact, the original Medium post was not updated as of publication time to reflect the correct years. Though the claim is accurate when the years are corrected, it leaves out context that the vast majority of the terrorism worldwide in 2014 did not directly affect the United States. Instead, it was largely concentrated in Africa and the Middle East. We rule the claim Mostly True.	None	Joe Pitts	None	None	None	2016-03-22T10:43:16	2016-02-25	['None']
pomt-01056	"America is No. 1 one in oil and gas."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/21/barack-obama/obama-america-no-1-producer-oil-gas/	The United States is on top of the world in terms of energy production, President Barack Obama said during his sixth State of the Union. "We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet," he said during his Jan. 20 address. "And today, America is number one in oil and gas. America is number one in wind power. Every three weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008." We decided to check out the data and see if in fact the United States is the world’s top oil and gas producer. As it turns out, the United States passed Saudi Arabia about two years ago in terms of oil production. And we’ve been the top producer of natural gas for more than two decades. The U.S. Energy Information Administration, which tracks global energy production and consumption statistics, generally uses total oil supply production as its most relevant statistic for assessing the world oil market. This statistic includes crude oil, natural gas liquids, condensates, other liquids, such as biofuels like ethanol, and refinery gain. By this measure, in the third quarter of 2014 -- which includes the most recent available data -- the United States produced 14.2 million barrels per day. The next-highest producer, Saudi Arabia, produced 11.7 million per day; and Russia produced 10.5 million per day. Together, that’s about 40 percent of total global production. If we whittle down that number further just to look at crude oil -- what typically comes to mind when we think of "oil production" -- with no other liquids, the United States is third behind Saudi Arabia and Russia. But when natural gas liquids are added into the mix, the United States takes the No. 1 spot again with 12.9 million barrels per day of crude oil and natural gas liquids. A note: Natural gas liquids -- included in the oil production count -- are different from natural gas. Natural gas liquids are derivatives of petroleum (like kerosene) that are found in the same rocks as a natural gas deposit. Natural gas is methane that comes from the ground as a gas. It’s the gas that comes out of a gas stove and heats buildings. The United States produces significantly more natural gas than Saudi Arabia and a bit more than Russia. According to the Energy Information Administration, United States energy production is about evenly split between petroleum and natural gas. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, primarily produces petroleum. Here is a chart showing the breakdown: The United States and Russia are the top producers of natural gas -- with the United States producing 29.5 trillion cubic feet in 2012, and Russia producing 23 trillion. Oil production growth has contributed to the United States’ ability to produce more oil than it imports for the first time in about 20 years. The Energy Information Administration expects American production to continue to grow in 2015, despite recent lower crude oil prices. The majority of U.S. oil production growth is concentrated in four regions: Bakken, N.D.; Eagle Ford, Texas; the Niobrara region in the Upper Midwest states; and the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico. North Dakota and Texas together comprise almost 50 percent of all crude oil production in the United States -- compared to 2010, when the two states combined produced just 26 percent of all U.S. crude oil production. In 2013, energy markets consultant group PIRA Energy published a report that said shale production is one of the driving forces behind the country’s production growth. Shale oil and gas are commonly associated with hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which is the process of using water pressure to fracture a rock to release natural gas and oil. The United States is the world leader in shale gas production. There is at least one piece of context to keep in mind when looking at the United States’ oil production compared with Saudi Arabia, noted Leonardo Maugeri, an associate at Harvard University’s Geopolitics of Energy project. Saudi Arabia has a higher capacity than the United States to produce oil, but it chooses not to use it all -- so as not to inundate the global oil market. "In other words, if Saudi Arabia produced at full capacity -- as the U.S. does -- its production would be higher than the U.S.," Maugeri said. Our ruling Obama said "America is No. 1 one in oil and gas " The latest global oil and natural gas production statistics back up Obama’s claim. The United States has been the world’s largest oil producer since 2012, and the largest natural gas producer for years. We rate his statement True.

pomt-05954	The United States is no longer "top nation in the globe on infrastructure," having fallen to 15th.	true	/tennessee/statements/2012/jan/25/steve-cohen/steve-cohen-pushes-democratic-claim-us-has-fallen-/	U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen says the United States has neglected its roads and bridges, but in November argued that the nation had an opportunity to repair them by passing President Barack Obama's jobs bill. In a speech on the House floor, the Memphis Democrat said the U.S. was lagging behind other nations. "No longer is America the top nation in the globe on infrastructure; it’s the countries in Asia and other places. We’re 15th on the list of infrastructure," Cohen said. That jobs bill may be going nowhere, but President Obama, in Tuesday’s State of the Union speech, called for "a broader agenda to repair America’s infrastructure." He said that "so much of America needs to be rebuilt" and that it was time "to do some nation-building right here at home." We wondered: Is the United States really falling behind other countries when it comes to infrastructure? Cohen's office says the source of his information was the Building America’s Future Education Fund, which bills itself as a "bipartisan national infrastructure coalition" and lobbies for more governmental spending on infrastructure -- especially roads and bridges. Cohen accurately quotes from the group’s report entitled, "Falling Apart and Falling Behind," which attributes the ranking to the World Economic Forum, a Switzerland-based international organization funded by more than 1,000 companies that promotes interaction among nations and conducts research with a declared commitment to "improving the state of the world." Actually, Building America’s Future slightly overstates America’s infrastructure rating by the World Economic Forum -- it’s No. 16 among 139countries in the 2011-12 rankings, not No. 15. The United States was 15th last year, having slipped from first back in 2005. The Forum infrastructure ranking is based on nine measures ranging from the number of airline seats available (we’re No. 1!) to the number of mobile phones per 100 residents (we’re No. 83). So it's worth noting that the overall ranking goes well beyond the point of the congressman’s speech, namely the need to build or repair roads and bridges. Still, on road rankings, perhaps the most relevant to Cohen’s commentary, the United States is listed 20th, just below Cyprus and just above Bahrain, so it's even lower than the overall number. Infrastructure is one of 12 "pillars" the World Economic Forum uses in compiling a "Global Competitiveness Index." (The United States ranked fifth in the overall index, down from fourth in the previous year and first as recently as 2008.) Our ruling So Cohen is off by a notch in the current overall rankings, while for roads and bridges, the U.S. actually ranks slightly lower, providing more evidence for his point. That's close enough to earn a True.	None	Steve Cohen	None	None	None	2012-01-25T16:00:12	2011-11-03	['United_States']
pomt-01566	A flight from Atlanta to Houston was canceled due to a "terrorist dry run."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/11/facebook-posts/facebook-post-claims-us-flight-canceled-after-terr/	A first-hand account of a supposed "terrorist dry run" on an American airplane is making its way around Facebook, with this July 29 post garnering over 90,000 shares. The account, written by a man named Tedd Petruna, describes how 11 passengers "in full Muslim attire" on AirTran Flight 297 from Atlanta to Houston made such a ruckus that the flight was canceled. Petruna claims that one of the men called a stewardess an "infidel dog," that two of the men were showing "footage of a porno video they had taped the night before," and that all 11 men screamed at the flight crew in Arabic. Eventually, Petruna says, Transportation Security Administration agents searched the men’s bags, and that when they allowed them back on, so many passengers left the plane that the flight was canceled. "The terrorists wanted to see how the TSA would handle" them, Petruna wrote. Only Fox News reported that the flight was canceled, Petruna says, and even they covered up the real "threat." Spoiler alert: Petruna’s report is a hoax, and not a new one either. The plane in question flew Nov. 17, 2009. In this fact-check, we’ll explain this conspiracy theory’s origin, then debunk it again for good measure. Remember chain emails? We reached out to Dwayne Chassion, the man who posted Petruna’s report on Facebook verbatim as it appeared in 2009, but didn’t hear back. After we messaged him, Chassion deleted the post from his Facebook account. The day after Flight 297, Fox News published a brief article from the Associated Press noting that Flight 297 departed for Houston two and a half hours late. According to the AP, "a crew member asked a passenger to turn off his phone," the passenger didn’t, and then the pilot returned the plane to the gate and "asked (the passenger) to get off the plane." Apparently, the man didn’t speak English -- he and his group of 11 others were travelling with a translator -- and was looking at pictures on either his phone or a camera. The full group of 13 men got off the plane when the pilot returned to the gate, but, after some discussion with airport officials, the men were allowed back on the plane. The two and a half hour delay pushed the original flight crew past mandated limits on hours worked. So AirTran subbed in a new flight crew and the plane left for Houston without incident -- minus 12 original passengers who, apparently uncomfortable, opted for later flights. That’s marginally similar to Petruna’s account, but the flight was not canceled and there certainly were no Arabic curses or homemade pornographic film. Within a few days of Flight 297, Petruna’s email began circulating. Eventually, it reached the websites of conservative pundits Glenn Beck and Debbie Schlussel. When AirTran got wind of Petruna’s email, they issued a point-by-point refutation. Long story short, Petruna wasn’t even on the plane because his connecting flight was late. Petruna later admitted that he embellished the details, and that he intended the account only for "a few friends." None of the other passengers corroborated Petruna’s assertion that the flight was canceled. One said that the passenger was Muslim -- but another said that he was actually speaking Spanish. According to a chaplain who arrived late but got on the plane after it returned to the gate, a passenger said that "12 men of Middle Eastern appearance stood up and began dancing and singing in an Arabic dialect." But no other passenger corroborated that, either. Either way, Flight 297 got off the ground, and although it may have been a tense flight, Petruna’s narrative was bogus then, and it’s bogus now. Our ruling Petruna’s 2009 account about a "terrorist dry run" leading to a canceled flight is going viral on Facebook. According to Petruna, 11 Muslim men were so uncooperative with their flight attendants that Flight 297 from Atlanta to Houston was canceled. But the airline, other passengers from the flight, and the Associated Press all disagreed. Petruna, although originally scheduled for the flight, never boarded. In actuality, a man who may or may not have been of Muslim descent didn’t speak English well enough to understand the flight attendant’s instructions to turn off his phone. Petruna’s account is outdated and riddled with inaccuracies. This claim rates Pants on Fire.	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2014-09-11T16:15:43	2014-09-11	['Atlanta', 'Houston']
pomt-14642	"Almost all of the polls that have come out suggest that I am a much stronger candidate against the Republicans than is Hillary Clinton."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/26/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-he-polls-better-against-gop-ca/	In the runup to the Iowa caucus, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has repeatedly said he has a better chance of beating the eventual Republican nominee in the Nov. 8 general election than fellow Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. "Almost all of the polls that -- and polls are polls, they go up, they go down -- but almost all of the polls that have come out suggest that I am a much stronger candidate against the Republicans than is Hillary Clinton," he told voters during a Jan. 19 town hall meeting in Underwood, Iowa. We took a look at the various national surveys, as compiled by RealClearPolitics and PollingReport.com to see how that assertion stacks up against the data. The only recent national poll to look at the question at the time Sanders made his comment was completed Jan. 13 for NBC News and the Wall Street Journal. If Donald Trump is the Republican nominee, it found, Sanders beats Trump by 15 percentage points compared to a 10-point win for Clinton. That certainly supports Sanders' claim, but that poll didn't compare him to any other GOP candidates. To find another poll to properly compare Clinton's and Sanders' relative strengths, you have to go back to a Quinnipiac Poll completed Dec. 20. There, Sanders beats Trump by 13 points while Clinton defeats him by 7 points. However, in a matchup against Republican Marco Rubio, Sanders loses by three points and Clinton wins by just a single point. Against Ted Cruz, Sanders loses by a point and Clinton ties Cruz at 44 percent each. So Clinton is performing slightly better, but these results are largely within the margin of error of +/- 2.9 points. A third poll, taken during the same timeframe as Quinnipiac by Public Policy Polling, found that Sanders would lose to Trump (by two points), Rubio (by three points), Cruz (by one point) and Jeb Bush (by one point). Clinton, in contrast, would beat Bush (by five points), Trump (by three points) and Cruz (two points), but lose to Rubio (by one point). Both Democrats would tie with Republican Ben Carson. The margin of error was +/- 2.8 percentage points. So the Public Policy Polling survey doesn't support Sanders either. (You can see a chart of the varying matchups and point differences at the end of this fact-check.) When we asked the Sanders campaign about the claim, they submitted a consultant's memo from Jan. 8, 2016, that focuses on the Quinnipiac study and two other polls, a CNN/ORC International Poll from Dec. 17-21 and an Economist/YouGov poll from Dec. 18-21. Neither the CNN/ORC survey nor the Economist/YouGov poll test Sanders in a general election against a Republican. Instead, the memo argues that Sanders, if nominated, is more likely to win in November because he polls better than Clinton among independent voters, he's "viewed more favorably than any other presidential candidate of either party," and Clinton's support is slipping against the Republicans. (For the record, the Economist/YouGov poll found that Clinton's favorability score was just as high as Sanders, with both at 44 percent. Of the 2,000 respondents, 39 percent were not registered to vote.) Whether high favorability ratings directly translate into votes in a general election is an open question. Our ruling Sanders said, "Almost all of the polls that have come out suggest that I am a much stronger candidate against the Republicans than is Hillary Clinton." The NBC News/Wall Street Journal national poll released before Sanders' statement supports his claim for Trump, but it has no data against Cruz or Rubio. Earlier polls say he doesn't outperform Clinton at all against Cruz, Rubio or Bush, and the narrow races combined with the margins of error make his contention even more dubious. Beating Clinton in only two of eight hypothetical matchups is far from "almost all." The statement is not accurate, so we rate it False.

pomt-02360	President Barack Obama spent "$5 billion paying Ukrainians to riot and dismantle their democratically elected government."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/19/facebook-posts/united-states-spent-5-billion-ukraine-anti-governm/	It’s a conspiracy with mainstream crossover: The United States bankrolled the bloody political uprising in Ukraine. We saw the claim pop up recently in a story on RT (the Russian-funded English language cable network), and found lots of talk about it on reddit, Facebook and other websites. The claims have the same basic structure. While President Barack Obama publicly said Ukrainians have the right to determine their own future, the U.S. government pumped $5 billion into the country to promote regime change. In a Facebook meme, someone put it this way: Obama "spends $5 billion paying Ukrainians to riot and dismantle their democratically elected government." So is there any truth to this claim? PunditFact dove in. The roots The claim is rooted in a December 2013 speech by Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland to the U.S.-Ukraine Foundation, a non-governmental agency that promotes democracy in the former Soviet republic. Nuland had returned days earlier from her third trip to Ukraine in five weeks to assess the protests over President Viktor Yanukovych’s policies to move away from the European Union, she said. She made clear the United States supported the protesters’ fight and spoke of how she met with Yanukovych, pressing him to end the pushback from Ukrainian security forces because it is "absolutely impermissible in a European state, in a democratic state." She described how American taxpayer money has supported Ukraine’s democratic development despite the country’s challenges. "Since Ukraine's independence in 1991, the United States has supported Ukrainians as they build democratic skills and institutions, as they promote civic participation and good governance, all of which are preconditions for Ukraine to achieve its European aspirations," she said. "We have invested over $5 billion to assist Ukraine in these and other goals that will ensure a secure and prosperous and democratic Ukraine." Her eight-minute speech (video) attracted little to no media attention. The truth We had a feeling that folks repeating the claim missed important context from Nuland’s speech. Wasn’t Nuland talking about money given since Ukraine broke away from the Soviet Union? The State Department said yes. "The insinuation that the United States incited the people of Ukraine to riot or rebel is patently false," said Nicole Thompson, a State Department spokeswoman. Since 1992, the government has spent about $5.1 billion to support democracy-building programs in Ukraine, Thompson said, with money flowing mostly from the Department of State via U.S. Agency for International Development, as well as the departments of Defense, Energy, Agriculture and others. The United States does this with hundreds of other countries. About $2.4 billion went to programs promoting peace and security, which could include military assistance, border security, human trafficking issues, international narcotics abatement and law enforcement interdiction, Thompson said. More money went to categories with the objectives of "governing justly and democratically" ($800 million), "investing in people" ($400 million), economic growth ($1.1 billion), and humanitarian assistance ($300 million). The descriptions are a bit vague, which could lead people to think the money was used for some clandestine purpose. But even if it that were so, the money in question was spent over more than 20 years. Yanukovych was elected in 2010. So any connection between the protests and the $5 billion is inaccurate. And Obama was elected in 2008, so any connection between $5 billion and Obama also is inaccurate. The challenge We attempted to drill down and verify the expenditures independently but found that a difficult task. That’s a byproduct of the United States’ foreign aid investments, which rival no other country (though supporters note the spending equals only 1 percent of all federal spending). The massive check-writing across dozens of agencies to non-governmental organizations to scores of countries and regions around the world is almost impossible to untangle. "As it stands, it is nearly impossible to find a figure," said Nicole Valentinuzzi, communications manager of Publish What You Fund, a group that pushes for aid transparency across the world. "These kinds of things would be easily verifiable if people were given timely information." The State Department created ForeignAssistance.gov to help taxpayers, journalists and others find out where the money is going, but the data is limited in the number of years available and not reported by all agencies. "The Foreign Assistance dashboard is not capturing this information in an up-to-date, current way," Valentinuzzi said, "so responding to a humanitarian crisis is a bit untraceable while it happens, which we argue makes it less effective, basically." That said, the United States is working on being more transparent. The site started under the Obama administration and is a "work in progress," Thompson said. Eight agencies, such as U.S. AID, Millennium Challenge Corporation and the Treasury Department, have begun posting planning and spending data to the site. Still, 14 agencies, including the departments of Agriculture, Energy, Transportation, and Health and Human Services, have not. From that website, we calculated the United States spent $456.4 million in Ukraine since 2009. Again, that’s an incomplete picture based on incomplete data reporting. Some examples? The United States spent about $20 million on Peace Corps programs in Ukraine over the past four years. It spent about $40 million through U.S. AID on health programs in the countries since 2010 -- fighting HIV/AIDs, malaria and providing for maternal and child health. The United States spent an additional $80 million or so working on projects related to weapons of mass destruction, according to ForeignAssistance.gov. Our ruling Contrary to claims, the United States did not spend $5 billion to incite the rebellion in Ukraine. That’s a distorted understanding of remarks given by a State Department official. She was referring to money spent on democracy-building programs in Ukraine since it broke off from the Soviet Union in 1991. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-07103	"As the Democrats finally maxed out their government spending credit card Monday, Kurt Schrader continued to stand with his party leaders in failing to offer any viable long-term solution."	false	/oregon/statements/2011/jun/22/national-republican-congressional-committee/kurt-schrader-fault-maxing-out-government-credit-c/	Rep. Kurt Schrader is neither drunken (as far as we know) nor is he a sailor. But that’s not the portrait the National Republican Congressional Committee paints of Schrader, the second-term Democrat from Oregon who is likely to face another tough campaign in 2012. The NRCC is in the business of electing Republicans and defeating people like Schrader. So it’s not surprising that on May 18 the organization sent out a news release accusing Schrader of spending federal tax dollars like a drunken sailor and blaming him for pushing government debt to the $14.3 trillion limit. "Kurt Schrader and his fellow Democrats went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out," the press release said. That’s a pretty exact, and if true, damning statement at a time when most voters are highly worried about the nation’s debt and not enamored with any politician who’s prone to go on "spending sprees.’’ So let’s take a look to determine if it stands up. Our government gets some of the cash it needs by borrowing from foreign governments and other investors. As happens when your bills come due and your current income cannot keep up, the United States now needs to borrow even more. To get the money, Congress first must approve a debt limit higher than the current one of $14.294 trillion. This is a lot like living on a credit card and asking the bank for a higher limit, an analogy that Republicans happen to like. In an attack used in some variation against Schrader and 58 other House Democrats, the NRCC also claimed that Schrader and his fellow Democrats "went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out." But is it the fault of Schrader and House Democrats that the federal credit card has been maxed out? Not exactly. You might remember the tax cuts championed by congressional Republicans and former President George W. Bush, tax cuts that were extended in December for two years under Democratic President Barack Obama. While some economists say these were needed to give the economy a kick, they also meant less money came in from tax revenue. Before the most recent extension, the Congressional Research Service said that the Bush tax cuts, with a 10-year price tag of $1 trillion, played a substantial role in the nation’s annual deficits. Some will argue that tax cuts can actually pay for themselves by stimulating economic growth, but PolitiFact has previously found that the Congressional Budget Office, the Treasury Department, the Joint Committee on Taxation and the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers say that tax cuts lead to revenues that are lower than they otherwise would have been – even if they spur some economic growth. Last year, the Congressional Budget Office said that extending all of them permanently, as many in the GOP would like, would cost $3.3 trillion over 10 years and increase deficits. Then there’s the recent economic downturn, which also played a role. And the nation is still engaged in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, with billions of dollars flowing out to pay for them. These began during the Bush years and continue under Obama. Schrader wasn’t in Congress when the war started. He has voted both for and against funding since he was elected. Despite the intensity of the recent debate, altering the debt ceiling - almost always up - has been routine practice in Washington for generations. The ceiling reflects the real world. With ongoing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, a deep recession and less revenue as a result of tax cuts enacted under former President George W. Bush, the gap between income and expenses has widened. "Since March 1962, Congress has enacted 74 separate measures that have altered the limit on federal debt," the Congressional Research Service said in a May report. The CRS is Congress’ non-partisan and independent analytical organization. "Most of these changes in the debt limit were, measured in percentage terms, small in comparison to changes adopted in wartime or during the Great Depression. Some recent increases in the debt limit, however, were large in dollar terms. For instance, in May 2003, the debt limit increased by $984 billion and in February 2010 the debt limit was increased by $1.9 trillion," the CRS report said. The case is even more difficult to make against Schrader since he is actively involved with the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Democrats, whose sole purpose in life is to restrain federal spending. In fact, Schrader chaired the group’s Fiscal Responsibility Task Force, which aims to restrain federal spending and reduce debt. In that capacity, Schrader helped write a budget proposal earlier this year that called for $100 billion less spending over the next 10 years. Schrader has repeatedly called for President Obama to use recommendations offered by the president’s National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. He also voted against extending the tax cuts enacted by former-President Bush and he has returned $180,000 in unused funds from his own congressional account. To say that Schrader ran up the credit card is a pithy political slogan, but it ignores all the other spending and borrowing that factored into the debt. Were the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the tax cuts the chief culprits? Democrats say yes. Conservatives disagree, saying that amounts to cherry picking and ignores all other spending. Before ruling, we’re compelled to point out that since 2001, Congress has voted to raise the debt ceiling ten times, according to the Congressional Research Service. Seven of those hikes were under Bush, three under Obama. Schrader, like most Democrats, has selectively voted to boost spending. But he’s also offered proposals calling for deep and specific cuts. The NRCC attack ignores both the facts and the basic history of spending decisions that predate Schrader’s arrival in Congress but which contribute to the fiscal reality that lawmakers and all Americans must face. Taken together, those oversights are substantial and the reason we rate this claim: False. Return to OregonLive to comment on this statement and ruling.

pomt-13699	Says Trump ties are made "in China, not Colorado. Trump suits in Mexico, not Michigan. Trump furniture in Turkey, not Ohio. Trump picture frames in India, not Wisconsin."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/29/hillary-clinton/dnc-hillary-clinton-slams-donald-trump-making-prod/	Donald Trump’s merchandise doesn’t show a commitment to making America great again, Hillary Clinton said in her keynote address on the last night of the Democratic National Convention. "He also talks a big game about putting America First," Clinton said. "Please explain to me what part of America First leads him to make Trump ties in China, not Colorado. Trump suits in Mexico, not Michigan. Trump furniture in Turkey, not Ohio. Trump picture frames in India, not Wisconsin. Donald Trump says he wants to make America great again. Well, he could start by actually making things in America again." Are all these Trump-brand products really made abroad? Let’s check it out. Claim: Trump neckties are made in China. We saw a "made in China" label on a Trump tie for sale on eBay, and here’s another one on Amazon. Many are listed as "imported," and we haven’t come across any that were definitely made in the United States. Claim: Trump suits are made in Mexico. At least one image of a Trump suit with a "made in Mexico" label has surfaced, and Trump has acknowledged he has made some of his clothing line there. We also found examples of Trump suits made in India and China. But we actually found quite a few for sale on Amazon that were made in the United States. Claim: Trump furniture is made in Turkey. The Trump Home by Dorya line – described in a press release as "inspired by the diverse locations and architecture of Trump properties around the globe" – is manufactured in Turkey. Claim: Trump picture frames are made in India. We could only find one Trump picture frame, and the Amazon page does not indicate where it was made. It lists the producer as IMAX, which is an Oklahoma-based company, though it does have facilities in India. But not all Trump products are made overseas. Some Trump products are made in the United States, including the candidate’s iconic "Make America Great Again" baseball cap, which is manufactured in California. We gave a Pants on Fire rating in October to a claim made by Twitter users that the hats were made in China. In a previous fact check, we found that some Trump-brand bedding, cologne, Trump Natural Spring Water and Trump Wine are also made in the United States. Our ruling Clinton says Trump ties are made "in China, not Colorado. Trump suits in Mexico, not Michigan. Trump furniture in Turkey, not Ohio. Trump picture frames in India, not Wisconsin." We found examples of Trump ties made in China, suits in Mexico and furniture in Turkey. We did not find a clear example of a Trump picture frame made in India.

pomt-04596	Says Barack Obama's comments indicate he "believes in redistribution" of wealth.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/sep/20/mitt-romney/romney-goes-tape-attack-obama/	Mitt Romney, seeking to regain his footing after a recent controversial audio recording of himself was unearthed earlier this week, used an old tape of Barack Obama to put the president on the defensive. "There’s a tape that came out just a couple of days ago where the president said, yes, he believes in redistribution," Romney, the Republican Party presidential nominee, said during a fundraiser Wednesday afternoon in Atlanta. Romney first talked about the recording Tuesday in a Fox News interview, saying Obama "likes" redistribution. Romney then said he believes in free enterprise, not redistribution of wealth. His running mate, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., also has pounced on the Obama audio on the campaign trail. We were curious to find out if the Romney campaign accurately reflected what Obama said and meant in the recording. Here’s the sentence in which Obama specifically spoke about redistribution: "I think the trick is figuring out how do we structure government systems that pool resources and hence facilitate some redistribution – because I actually believe in redistribution, at least at a certain level to make sure that everybody's got a shot." Obama apparently made those remarks, according to a pro-Romney website, at Loyola University in Chicago on Oct. 19, 1998, when Obama was an Illinois state senator. Obama campaign officials said Romney’s discussion of the recording was the sign of a desperate campaign. "Fourteen years ago, then-Sen. Obama was making an argument for a more efficient, more effective government — specifically citing city government agencies that he didn’t think were working effectively," Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt said, according to ABC News. "He believed then, and believes now, that there are steps we can take to promote opportunity and ensure that all Americans have a fair shot if they work hard. Unlike Gov. Romney, he doesn’t believe that if you’re a student who applies for a loan, you’re looking for a handout." We asked the Romney campaign Wednesday afternoon for any additional information they thought may be useful and may address any concerns that their candidate took Obama’s 1998 remarks out of context. Romney officials sent us a transcript of Obama’s remarks and link to the audio. In the Fox News interview, Romney gave his interpretation of what he believed Obama meant. "The president’s view is one of a larger government. There’s a tape that just came out today in which the president said that he likes redistribution," Romney said. For months, the Obama and Romney campaigns have dueled over their drastically different ideals of what role the federal government should play in America. Earlier this week, a secretly recorded audio of Romney went public in which he said at a Florida fundraiser in May that 47 percent of Americans will vote for Obama "no matter what" because they are dependent on government and feel that they are "victims." PolitiFact has fact-checked several of the claims in the Romney audio. Romney has since said his comments could have been more elegantly stated, but he stands by his larger point that a "government-centered nation" is not good for America. Romney and Republicans have consistently portrayed Obama as a president who wants to expand government and engage in class warfare because of his proposal to increase income taxes on those who make more than $250,000 a year. In 2008, GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin said Obama wanted to "spread the wealth" because of his tax policy and "experiment with socialism" as president. PolitiFact rated that claim a Pants on Fire. The 96-second audio indicates Obama was near the end of his remarks at Loyola. The audio begins with Obama talking about policy research for the working poor. He then spoke about battling the notion that government action is ineffective. "There has been a systematic propaganda campaign against the possibility of government action and its efficacy, and I think some of it has been deserved," Obama said. In the audio, Obama is critical of the Chicago Housing Authority and Chicago Public Schools, saying neither has been a good model of policymaking. The portion of the recording that the Romney campaign has seized upon ends with Obama discussing redistribution. But Obama said more, NBC News reports. NBC News found an additional clip of the recording. Here’s what Obama said: "I think the trick is figuring out how do we structure government systems that pool resources and hence facilitate some redistribution because I actually believe in redistribution, at least at a certain level to make sure that everybody's got a shot. How do we pool resources at the same time as we decentralize delivery systems in ways that both foster competition, can work in the marketplace, and can foster innovation at the local level and can be tailored to particular communities." So Obama is also talking about ways to encourage competitiveness and innovation, themes Romney consistently extols on the campaign trail. Romney, though, may disagree with Obama’s definition of competitiveness and innovation. Finally, Obama has long advocated raising taxes on the wealthy in order to avoid cuts to social spending programs for the middle and lower classes. Polls show most Americans support increasing taxes on the wealthy. That’s a form of "redistribution," though Obama doesn’t call it that today. Also, the progressive income tax code itself, which both parties have supported in the past, could fairly be called "redistribution." It enshrines the idea that the rich pay a larger share of their income for government services that benefit everyone. Our ruling: To review, Romney said Obama "believes in redistribution." Romney said on Fox in discussing the 1998 audio that Obama shows he believes in "a larger government." Obama said in the recording that he believes in structuring "government systems that pool resources" to make sure everyone has a shot. Obama didn’t specifically talk about making government bigger in those remarks. Obama was even critical of some government agencies in Chicago in the clip. Obama also spoke about ways to foster competition and innovation. Obama spoke of redistribution in a way that government can create an even playing field for everyone and encourage competition. The clip of the 1998 audio that Romney referenced to criticize Obama doesn’t tell the complete story. We rate Romney’s claim as Mostly True.

pomt-07935	"Since taking office, President Obama has signed into law spending increases of nearly 25 percent for domestic government agencies, an 84 percent increase when you include the failed stimulus."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jan/27/paul-ryan/us-rep-paul-ryan-says-obama-increased-spending-nea/	U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan’s response to President Barack Obama’s State of the Union speech called to mind their face-to-face -- but civil -- sparring in January 2010. Back then, when Obama attended a House Republican caucus meeting, Ryan told the president in a televised exchange: "The spending bills that you have signed into law, the domestic discretionary spending has been increased by 84 percent." Ryan, R-Wisconsin, is now chairman of the House Budget Committee. Delivering the GOP response to Obama’s address, Ryan first threw Obama a bone ("There's no doubt the president came into office facing a severe fiscal and economic situation."). Then he criticized Obama’s stimulus plan, saying it "not only failed to deliver on his promise to create jobs, but also plunged us even deeper into debt." We were interested in what he said next: "The facts are clear: Since taking office, President Obama has signed into law spending increases of nearly 25 percent for domestic government agencies, an 84 percent increase when you include the failed stimulus." NFL coaches talk about "cleaning up" mistakes before the next big game. It appears that’s what Ryan did here -- at least in part. In the wake of the Nov. 2, 2010 election, we gave Ryan a Barely True for repeating to reporters his assertion from Baltimore about an 84 percent increase in the past two years. Ryan was on the right track in pointing to the federal stimulus package as a huge driver in spending increases under Obama. But Ryan used fuzzy math to make the year-to-year increase appear much larger than it was. The spending figures for non-defense discretionary spending did show a 24 percent jump -- from $434 billion in 2008 to $537 billion in 2010. Discretionary spending goes for such things as education, health and housing -- in contrast to mandatory expenditures such as Social Security and Medicare "entitlements." To get to 84 percent, Ryan -- and other GOP leaders who have repeated the claim -- put the one-time stimulus spending in 2010, not 2009 when the measure passed. That’s what made it artificially higher, creating a rocket-like impression instead of the roller-coaster effect -- up a lot and then down some -- created by the stimulus package. Experts said it was OK to include stimulus, if it was disclosed, and as long as it appeared as a one-time blip and was properly accounted for. That brings us back to Ryan’s revised statement. The numbers show a 24 percent increase from 2008 to 2010. Ryan accurately rounded it up to "nearly 25 percent." And he added the reference to stimulus package, to give a fuller picture of what was behind the numbers. But he continued to use the 84 percent. That’s an inaccurate number. It is created only when the stimulus is assigned to the wrong year. We were unable to reach Ryan spokespeople for this item. So let’s tie this up. Ryan has added the 25 percent figure into his public assertions of spending increases under Obama. And though he adds context with the stimulus disclaimer, the 84 percent is ultimately dubious. It exists only because of the accounting trick used to produce it. Ryan argues he is trying to capture the effect of stimulus funding. A worthy goal, but his method overstates the effect. We rate this statement, a mix of truth and exaggeration, as Half True.	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2011-01-27T15:01:17	2011-01-25	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-14023	"Today, it is more difficult to enlist in the U.S. military than it is to enroll in college."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jun/01/dale-kooyenga/its-easier-get-college-military/	So, if three out of every four young adults are not eligible for the military, but two out of every three high school graduates go onto college, what does that say? To Wisconsin state Rep. Dale Kooyenga, a military intelligence officer in the Army Reserves and a veteran of the Iraq War, it says this: "Today, it is more difficult to enlist in the United States military than it is to enroll in college." That’s a broad claim from Kooyenga, a suburban Milwaukee Republican who made the statement in his April 1, 2016 constituent newsletter. He was asserting that "if we are going to continue to be the world’s military leader, we must also become a leader in education." Kooyenga seems to have a compelling talking point. But, as defense manpower specialist Beth Asch told us, it’s also "a mashup of a lot of ideas in one sentence." Post-high school Both the military and college are post-high school pursuits that require a high school diploma. But the similarities more or less end there. The military is looking for soldiers; colleges are looking for students. The minimum requirements to get into the military are pretty standard, even if they vary somewhat by branch. But the entrance requirements to get into Harvard are much different than those for getting into a community college. The military will pay you; but most students need to pay for college. So, in terms of Kooyenga’s claim: More difficult for whom? It’s more difficult for an overweight person with good grades to get into the military; but it’s more difficult for a fit person with bad grades to get into college. All that being said, Kooyenga does have some numbers on his side. The statistics Asch, an economist with the RAND Corp. think tank, said statistics Kooyenga cited to us to back his claim are generally on target. Military: Defense Department estimates dating back to at least 2009 say roughly 75 percent of Americans ages 17 to 24 would not qualify to enlist in the military. One reason is being overweight. Indeed, when first lady Michelle Obama said in 2011 that more than one-quarter of America’s young adults are too fat to serve in the U.S. military, PolitiFact Georgia rated her claim True. Other common reasons for being barred from the military, besides lacking a high school diploma: Conviction of a felony or serious misdemeanor; prior drug or alcohol abuse; and current prescription-drug use for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). College: Federal statistics, including one Kooyenga cited, show that roughly 66 percent of people who graduate from high school go onto college. (For 2015 high school graduates, 69 percent had enrolled in colleges or universities by October 2015, according to a federal report.) But, the two sets of figures reinforce the point that, while Kooyenga’s claim was broad, it really comes down to individual characteristics as to whether it’s more difficult for a person to get into the military versus college. Our rating Kooyenga said: "Today, it is more difficult to enlist in the U.S. military than it is to enroll in college." There isn’t definitive evidence to prove the claim, given that it mixes apples and oranges: The military and college are entirely different pursuits with different sets of minimum standards for getting in, and among colleges, the entrance requirements vary widely. At the same time, there are credible estimates saying that roughly 75 percent of young adults in America wouldn’t be eligible to enlist if they tried, while roughly two out of three high school graduates go on to a two- or four-year college. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.	None	Dale Kooyenga	None	None	None	2016-06-01T05:00:00	2016-04-01	['United_States']
pomt-07917	Says government is a barrier to innovation and development.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/31/paul-broun/rep-paul-broun-says-innovation-would-flower-if-gov/	Rep. Paul Broun, R-Ga., spent the State of the Union address sending a fusillade of tweets critical of President Barack Obama to his 3,000-odd followers. One of them in particular caught our attention. "If the govt would get out of the way, we could have innovation and development," Broun tweeted. (Since civility was a major issue surrounding the address, we should note that Broun didn’t tweet from the chamber while Obama was speaking. A spokeswoman told Roll Call that he watched the speech from his Capitol Hill office.) Broun’s office didn’t get back to us to elaborate on the substance of his tweet, but it is based on the assumption that government stands in the way of innovation and development. We’ve long heard complaints from conservatives like Broun that business is being stifled by over-regulation. Even Obama got into the act during the run-up to his address, issuing an executive order that would, as he described it in an op-ed, help to "root out regulations that conflict, that are not worth the cost or that are just plain dumb." But even if you concede that some deregulation is desirable, we wondered whether Broun was right that government, as a whole, is an impediment to innovation and development. So we looked at statistics and spoke to experts in the field. First, the statistics. According to the National Science Foundation, business did account for 67 percent of research-and-development expenditures in 2008. The federal government spent 25 percent, and universities and other nonprofits spent about 3 percent each. Industry dollars are especially important in applied research and the development of technologies for the market. However, the federal government shoulders the bulk of the burden in one crucial area of research -- basic research. This is the kind of fundamental scientific and medical research that has no immediate payoff. According to NSF, the federal government funds 57 percent of basic research, compared to less than 18 percent for business, 15 percent for colleges and universities and 11 percent for nonprofits. And business only funds about 6 percent of university-based scientific research -- one-tenth the share paid for by the federal government -- so a retreat by government could have wide collateral damage to university research. The government has been a major scientific funder for more than half a century. If you add up all the direct research spending in the U.S. since 1953, the federal government has poured in more than $3 trillion. Business has spent an additional $4.5 trillion over that period. (For a quarter century, government expenditures on research exceeded those by industry, but around 1980, the pattern reversed.) Government also helps support research in other ways. Since 1981, the federal government has given companies a tax break for research and experimentation, which has saved companies about $5 billion per year in recent years. Federal taxpayers fund the National Institute of Standards and Technology to the tune of almost $1 billion a year; among other things, NIST sets technical standards so that industry can work more efficiently. And the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office provides archived and ongoing patent information that private companies can access. And none of this counts the larger, but harder to quantify, investments by federal, state and local governments in elementary and higher education and infrastructure, all of which help set the stage for scientific innovation. When we showed Broun’s tweet to several historians, they said his view is, at best, incomplete. "Yes, the U.S. has the most dynamic and entrepreneurial economy in the world because it has less regulation and less top-down planning and micromanagement than other developed nations," said Margaret O'Mara, a historian at the University of Washington. "But the high-tech revolution since 1950, and the United States' central role in it, was the result of unprecedented government investment in science and engineering. The critical thing that government does -- and that private-sector research can't do -- is to provide the start-up capital for innovations that do not yet have a commercial market." The funding statistics cited earlier underscore this point. Businesses are much more eager to spend their research dollars on projects that have immediate prospects of earning money. "Private industry by and large doesn’t do (basic research) because it’s primarily interested in research that has a high likelihood of practical payoff," said Daniel Kevles, a historian of science at Yale Law School. Yet the experts we spoke to said that the biggest conceptual leaps have occurred at the level of basic research, where government is the primary funder, rather than the later stages of refinement, where businesses shoulder most of the cost. In addition, federal research typically gets made public, where it can be used by industry, whereas industry-funded research is often kept for the private use of its sponsor. The Internet is a good example of a technological innovation that was birthed by the federal government, specifically the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, said O’Mara, author of Cities of Knowledge: Cold War Science and the Search for the Next Silicon Valley. In 1973, DARPA began to research ways to link geographically scattered computers over a network, eventually coming up with widely used, standardized protocols for information sharing. In 1986, NSF established its own network which has become a major backbone of today’s Internet. "If we had left it to Lotus and IBM, we would have a couple of tiny, proprietary and fairly useless systems out there," added Diana Hicks, a science policy expert who chairs the School of Public Policy at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Other areas that experienced breakthroughs due to federal support include biotechnology, genomics, nanotechnology, nuclear physics, solid-state physics, organic chemistry and mathematics, said Paul A. David, an emeritus professor of economics at Stanford University. Federally funded discoveries "have become the foundation for whole domains of research from which new industries have arisen," David said. So while "the key to a vibrant entrepreneurial economy is having the government ‘get out of the way,’" O’Mara said, "that can only happen after there has been investment on a huge scale and that does not necessarily have an immediate commercial application. That's something that only the national government can provide." Broun could hardly get into the details of his science policy preferences in a 140-character tweet, and it's possible he didn't mean that he wanted government to get out of scientific research entirely. But we still feel it’s fair to take his comment to task. For starters, it was not an isolated comment -- the tweet we’re looking at here was just one of several he sent during the State of the Union that addressed the same theme, including "Entrepreneurship is great -- let's not kill it with taxes and regulations" and "Obama's policies kill free-enterprise." More broadly, portraying business as good and government as bad has been a consistent Republican talking point. But to base a tweet on the assumption that the federal government is bad for innovation and development ignores that the federal government -- through its direct research spending, its tax credits and its indirect investments that support technological research -- plays a crucial role in pushing it forward, and one that is unlikely to be ever picked up by the private sector alone. So we rate the claim that the government is a barrier to innovation and development False.	None	Paul Broun	None	None	None	2011-01-31T17:38:30	2011-01-25	['None']
pomt-05131	Women "earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men in the same position."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jun/24/david-cicilline/us-rep-david-cicilline-says-women-earn-only-77-per/	Some "facts" are repeated so often they become accepted wisdom. One of them, involving the gap between pay for women and men, was offered up by U.S. Rep. David Cicilline in a news release supporting the Paycheck Fairness Act, which failed a test vote in the House on June 5. "Nearly a century since suffrage was achieved, women continue to lag behind men in terms of compensation in the workplace," Cicilline said. "It is unacceptable that women continue to earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men in the same position. In many families, women have grown increasingly responsible for household income, and we must work to ensure that their pay keeps pace with their participation in the job market." The 77-cent figure has been repeated a lot by politicians and news organizations. President Obama has cited it. We saw it in a Cicilline fundraising letter after the GOP blocked the paycheck bill. It was the subject of an NBC "Meet The Press" exchange in which liberal commentator Rachel Maddow quoted the figure and Republican political strategist Alex Castellanos said the statistic was misleading. "For example, men work an average of 44 hours a week. Women work 41 hours a week. Men go into professions like engineering, science and math that earn more. Women want more flexibility," Castellano said amid a lot of overtalk. If the wage difference were so great, said Castellano, "every greedy businessman in America would hire only women, save 25 percent and be hugely profitable." An issue of discrimination The underlying issue here is discrimination and the question is whether the pay is truly different for men and women doing the same job. Because Cicilline said women earned only 77 cents for every dollar that men earned "in the same position," we decided to focus on his statement. When we asked Cicilline's office about the congressman's comment, spokesman Richard Luchette sent us to the usual source: a 2011 Census report showing the 77-percent level of female earnings to male earnings from 1960 to 2010. The data, in Figure 12 of the report, apply to full-time, year-round workers more than 14 years old. (The 77-percent number has been increasingly slowly, up from 60 percent during the 1960s and 1970s.) But that's not a job-by-job comparison. Luchette said Cicilline's statement is accurate because when he referred to "in the same position," the congressman meant "to refer to men and women who were in the same position in the labor force [full-time, year-round employees]." We believe that when someone says they are paid less "in the same position," most people would understand that to be a job-by-job comparison. That's the standard we will use in this fact check. There are different ways to measure gender differences and each has its drawbacks. For example, the census looked at annual salary, but that includes bonuses and other compensation that are more likely to boost the pay of people in higher-paying brackets. It also includes self-employed but fails to account for professions such as teaching, where the full-time jobs don't last for a full year. There are other -- and perhaps better -- ways to measure the gap. For example, among people with full-time jobs, men were more likely to work longer hours than women, which would make their annual income look larger than women's. If you look at weekly pay among full-time workers, women age 16 and older are paid 81 cents for every dollar men earned in 2010, according to Table 1 of a July 2011 report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. If you look at hourly pay for all workers (Table 9), women earned 86 cents for every dollar men earned that year. The amount rose to 95 cents if you looked at women who had never married, suggesting that marriage may be a factor. The rate was 97 cents among female college graduates, compared to male college graduates. Still, that's a gap. Perhaps the most revealing part of the report is Table 5, which looks at weekly earnings by the number of hours men and women work. Overall, women age 16 and older earned 75 cents in 2010 for every dollar men earned. But that hides some surprising numbers. If you look at part-time work (less than 35 hours), women earned $1.04 cents for every dollar men earned. Women who worked 35 to 39 hours earned nearly $1.13 cents for each dollar earned by their male counterparts. But as soon as the number of hours rose to 40 hours, women's earnings dropped to about 87 cents per dollar. By the job But that's still not the type of job-by-job comparison we believe Cicilline was talking about. The Bureau of Labor Statistics tried to do that, too. Table 2 of the report compared the weekly earnings for men and women -- all employed full time -- for 501 occupations. However, for nearly 8 out of 10 of those jobs, the analysts didn't have enough data on male workers or female workers to make a reliable comparison. Among the 111 categories for which a comparison was possible, women in 45 jobs were paid less than 80 cents on the dollar and women in 35 positions were paid 80 to 90 cents for every dollar paid to men doing same task. Only in 31 of the categories did women earn at least 90 cents for every dollar that the men earned. (Women were paid more in only four jobs. Pay rates for women were $1.05 for every dollar earned by men among people who worked as stock clerks and order fillers. The rates were $1.10 among female bill and account collectors, $1.12 for food preparation and serving workers, and $1.05 among social service counselors.) Even in professions where women have predominated, men made more, according to the report. Female elementary and middle school teachers earned 91 cents on the dollar compared to men. Female registered nurses made less than 87 cents. The Institute for Women's Policy Research has done a more-exhaustive evaluation of the database and concluded that women earned less in the most common, highest paying and lowest paying occupations. But, again, the data are limited. Even those numbers may be overestimating the gap. Three years ago, the U.S. Department of Labor released the results of a study by CONSAD Research Corp. that it had commissioned because, according to the preface by Charles E. James Sr., a deputy assistant secretary, "the raw wage gap continues to be used in misleading ways to advance public policy agendas without fully explaining the reasons behind the gap." Once adjusted for the fact that women are more likely to work part-time (where the pay for everyone tends to be lower), leave the labor force for children or elder care, and gravitate toward "family friendly" occupations where compensation is more likely to be in the form of health insurance or other fringe benefits, the gap shrinks to between 93 cents and 95 cents on the dollar, the report said. "The raw wage gap should not be used as the basis to justify corrective action," said James. "Indeed, there may be nothing to correct. The differences in raw wages may be almost entirely the result of the individual choices being made by both male and female workers." The report was released in January, 2009. Obviously, that hasn't stopped the debate. Our ruling David Cicilline said women "earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men in the same position." His spokesman said that was only a comparison among full-time, year-round workers. But we believe the average person would read his statement as a comparison of male and female workers in the same job, an indication that wage discrimination exists. But the source of that 77-cent figure is not based on a job-by-job assessment. It's an across-the-workforce number that fails to take into a host of factors that could skew the amount. All the data we examined showed pay gaps for women from as low as 58 cents to as high as $1.12 for every dollar earned by men. And when you look at weekly earnings among wage and salary workers who work less than 40 hours a week, women earn more than men. In citing the 77-cent figure, Cicilline ignores conflicting estimates suggesting that the gender gap is narrower or, perhaps, nonexistent when lifestyle choices are taken into account. He also skirts a key problem: for most occupations, there is not enough good data to make the kind of comparison he is talking about. In other words, his statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression: our definition of Mostly False.

pomt-06408	On whether he would run for U.S. Senate in 2012.	full flop	/florida/statements/2011/oct/27/connie-mack/us-rep-connie-mack-said-he-wouldnt-run-us-senate-n/	"The time is not right for me," (U.S. Rep. Connie) Mack said. "You have to put family and friends above political ambitions, and that is what I have done." —March 25, 2011, Fort Myers News-Press "Connie Mack is running for the U.S. Senate. ...," said David James, a senior adviser. —Oct. 26, 2011, Miami Herald In March 2011, U.S. Rep. Connie Mack said he would make a major announcement on the Lee County Courthouse steps. It was the spot where his father, Connie Mack III, had announced a Senate run in 1987. Some assumed the Fort Myers Republican would enter the 2012 race to face Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson. Instead, he said his family would come first. He would seek re-election to his House seat rather than run for U.S. Senate. "I've got two small children and it’s hard enough to get to spend a lot of good quality time now. I have a wife. They are all very important to me and at the end of the day family has to be No. 1," Mack told the St. Petersburg Times. In July, when his friend state Senate President Mike Haridopolos dropped out of the Republican race for Nelson's seat, the question came up again. Mack had been seen in Washington, D.C., meeting with a political strategist. Might he be planning to step into the Senate contest? He told St. Petersburg Times reporter Alex Leary he was focused on his current job. "So you're ruling it out?" Leary asked. His reply: "Yeah." In August, he spoke to Lee County Women Republicans. He said he kept hearing his name mentioned as a candidate, the Fort Myers News-Press reported. "No, I'm not running for Senate," he said. But on Oct. 26, political reporters scrambled on reports he might be joining the race, after all. "He's getting in the race," adviser David James told the St. Petersburg Times. "Making calls, assembling a team. He will have more to say in an announcement in weeks to come." "Connie Mack is running for the U.S. Senate," James told the Miami Herald. 'He is making calls. He is assembling a team. And he will have more to announce about the run in the weeks ahead." "I can confirm that he is getting in," he told the News-Press. Mack has yet to make an official announcement.

pomt-13958	Last year, "244 suspected terrorists walked into gun shops and attempted to purchase a firearm; 223 were able to get the firearm."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/15/charles-schumer/charles-schumer-terror-watch-list-buy-guns-got-the/	The mass shooting in Orlando, Fla., June 12 reopened the debate over who should access to guns, with Democrats calling for stricter controls. During a June 14 news conference in Washington, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said most people suspected of terrorism in the United States haven't haven't found it difficult to purchase a weapon. "Last year, 244 people on the terror watch list tried to purchase guns; 244 suspected terrorists walked into gun shops and attempted to purchase a firearm; 223 were able to get the firearm. Only 21 went empty-handed," Schumer said. "Ninety-one percent of suspected terrorists, when they sought to purchase a gun, last year were successful, according to GAO." The GAO is the U.S. Government Accountability Office. First, some background on these "suspected terrorists." The FBI's Terrorist Screening Center maintains a list of people "known or reasonably suspected of being involved in terrorist activity." This list is secret but it's believed to have around 700,000 names collected by U.S. and global agencies. It's estimated that 10,000 of those names are Americans and the rest are foreigners. We looked at this issue in December when we examined U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy's tweet that "91 percent of suspected terrorists who attempted to buy guns in America walked away with the weapon they wanted." We rated Murphy's statement Mostly True. (Murphy, who is running in Florida's Democratic primary for U.S. Senate in 2016, issued the tweet after Republicans repeatedly blocked a bill that would keep people on the FBI list from buying guns.) Murphy was referencing a GAO report from March 2015. But Schumer's statement focused on the entire year of 2015. So we found the updated report. Issued March 7, 2016, it found — as Schumer reported — that only 21 of the 244 transactions attempted by people on the terrorist watch list at a licensed firearms shop were blocked. In 223 cases, the customers got their weapons. But there are important omissions in these numbers. So we don't know that 244 people on the list attempted to buy guns. We know that people on the list attempted to buy guns 244 times. On the flip side, the number of people on the watch list who legally purchased weapons may be far higher because the tally doesn't include transactions made at gun shows, where federal background checks aren’t conducted. Finally, there have been questions about the accuracy of the watchlist itself. A 2009 U.S. Justice Department audit showed that 35 percent of the people on the list were "associated with FBI cases that did not contain current international terrorist or domestic terrorism designations" and should have been removed from the list. There also are multiple entries for slight variations of the same name, which means people with the same name as a person on the watch list were stopped at airports, a problem that experts say has largely been resolved. Our ruling Schumer said that in 2015, "244 suspected terrorists walked into gun shops and attempted to purchase a firearm; 223 were able to get the firearm" according to the GAO report. He correctly notes that this is gun shop data from the GAO, but he is wrong to suggest that the report is a tally of the number of suspected terrorists trying to make a firearm purchase. As the report makes clear, it's the number of attempted transactions, some of which might have been done by the same individual. The statement is accurate but it needs clarification and additional information, so we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/47d79ce0-3137-4146-834d-1d858403e397	None	Charles Schumer	None	None	None	2016-06-15T16:03:48	2016-06-14	['None']
pomt-03719	Says a gun bill before the Senate "is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/16/Arizona-Citizens-Defense-League/gun-rights-group-says-senate-bill-proposes-univers/	Just what’s in that new gun bill under debate in the Senate? Opponents would love to tell you all about it. "Stop Federal Universal Firearms Registration!" says the subject line of an email from an Arizona group this week. The message urges readers to contact their senators, warning: "In reality S. 649 is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners." The bill, known as the Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013, would make all gun sales subject to the nation’s background check laws, with limited exceptions. Does it propose universal firearm registration? Background checks and registries We read the bill, and consulted experts, including legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, attorneys who helped represent security guard Dick Heller in his successful Supreme Court challenge to D.C.’s handgun ban, and the spokesperson for the Arizona Citizens Defense League. The bill would require "a background check for every firearm sale" — or transfer of ownership — with a few exceptions, such as for certain family members. Right now, federal background checks are only required for sales through licensed gun dealers. Here’s how background checks work. The FBI maintains the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. When you buy a gun from a federally licensed dealer, you fill out a form with personally identifying information. The dealer uses the NICS to match that information with various records to make sure you’re not, for example, a felon who’s not allowed to own a weapon. It’s a computerized process that’s only supposed to take about 30 seconds, but in the case of an unclear match, can take up to three days. If you’re cleared to purchase a gun, the government is required to destroy all identifying information about you before the next business day. Instead, the dealer is required to store the form. That’s right: Federal law requires destruction of records and bans creation of a federal gun registry. Does S. 649, sponsored by Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., change that? Several attorneys we spoke to said no, it didn’t — it leaves those provisions in place. More people would be subject to background checks, but a federal database of that information would remain as illegal as ever. But Chris Calabrese, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, says the language of the bill leaves a door open for a new kind of record of sales between private sellers — as opposed to sales by federally licensed gun dealers — a record that may not be subject to the registry ban. "We have a real fear with this particular legislative language that this would result in new records being created," he said. He points to a legal phrase in the bill — "notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter" — as perhaps allowing creation and, later, collection of those records, even though existing law rules out "a system of registration of firearms, firearms owners, or firearms transactions or dispositions." So, even if there’s no intent to create such a loophole in the registry ban, the law doesn’t explicitly rule it out, he argues. Call it the possibility of a partial registry. "I don't think it's a crazy idea to say that if the records exist, there would be a push to use them for other things," Calabrese said. He contrasts the bill’s vague language with an amendment proposed by Sens. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., that would explicitly bar any such registry and adds the possibility of up to 15 years in prison for violators. But even if the federal government created a new type of record for gun sales between private sellers — and tracked them — that wouldn’t be "universal registration of all firearms and their owners," as suggested by the Arizona group’s email message. "There are at least 300 million guns in private ownership in America today, and I am not aware of any provision of S. 649 that would require the registration of those guns or assist the federal government in determining precisely who owns them," said Clark Neily, who was co-counsel to Dick Heller in District of Columbia vs. Heller. (Still, he said, mentioning the ACLU’s worry, the Arizona email "touches upon a genuine concern.") So what does the Arizona Citizens Defense League say about its claim that the bill "is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners"? Essentially, that the government will violate its own rules against keeping background check records. "This is where background knowledge of the issue is so important, and goes WAY beyond what is written in statute," said Charles Heller, a radio host and spokesperson for the Arizona Citizens Defense League. (He’s no relation to Dick Heller.) He says the FBI’s NICS system could illegally store results of all background checks. "This is simply a method to herd all transfers to being ‘on record,’ for later confiscation," he said. But the email message didn’t say the law would make it easier for the federal government to create an illegal gun registry. It said: "The true subject of S. 649 is the requirement to report all firearms transfers to the federal government via ‘universal background checks.’ In reality S. 649 is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners. As history has repeatedly shown us, and is currently being demonstrated in New York, registration is the prelude to confiscation." That’s simply not what the bill proposes. Robert Levy, the chairman of the board of directors of the libertarian Cato Institute, was in his own words, "a vigorous advocate for the right to possess firearms for self-defense" as co-counsel to Dick Heller in District of Columbia vs. Heller. He acknowledges the concern that expanding background checks creates a data trail that Americans must trust is being destroyed in a timely way by the federal government. Still, he says, "it's incorrect to assert that S. 649 is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners." Our ruling An email circulated to Arizona residents claims a bill before the Senate "is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners." The bill expands background checks to most gun transfers. But federal rules forbid the government from keeping a record of successful background checks for more than a day. The ACLU argues it’s possible the bill creates a new type of record for some sales that may not be subject to the ban, but that’s not the same thing as "universal registration of all firearms and their owners." We rate the claim False.	None	Arizona Citizens Defense League	None	None	None	2013-04-16T10:25:18	2013-04-10	['None']
pomt-11015	"Chicago is experiencing right now the highest employment since 1950."	false	/illinois/statements/2018/jul/09/rahm-emanuel/emanuel-wrong-again-chicago-jobs/	Chicago’s unemployment rate is at its lowest point since the run-up to the Great Recession. And as of this spring, fewer city residents were jobless than at any other time in at least three decades. So there’s good news on the jobs front that Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel could reasonably tout. Instead, he is now clinging to a variation of a boast we rated as False when we first heard him utter it in January. Back then, he declared Chicago in 2017 enjoyed the "highest employment in the private sector in the history of the city." His revised variation narrows the comparison by more than a century and no longer explicitly confines it to workers in the private sector. "Chicago is experiencing right now the highest employment since 1950," Emanuel declared recently during a public television interview on WTTW’s "Chicago Tonight" program. A few minutes later in the interview, he repeated the point to underscore how attractive the city has become to employers. Is Emanuel now on more solid ground with his amended jobs claim than when we checked him early this year? We decided to take a second look. A numbers game Emanuel didn’t explain the basis for his new claim. We sought clarification from a mayoral spokesman, but he did not provide it. But, in a nutshell, the answer to our question is no. State and federal headcounters conduct different jobs tallies, but none render numbers that match the superlatives uttered by the mayor either now or in January. Underlying our skepticism of Emanuel’s initial claim was an obvious demographic reality: Chicago’s population has been shrinking for decades and, at 2.7 million residents, is 900,000 fewer than its 1950 peak recorded by the Census. Early this year, an Emanuel spokesman said the mayor’s numbers came from an annual report from the Illinois Department of Employment Security. That report does not tally jobs held by Chicago residents, but rather private-sector jobs located in the city held by Chicagoans and suburbanites alike. For 2017, that report showed 1.18 million private-sector jobs in the city, the highest number reported by the state since 1990 when it recorded 1.2 million private-sector jobs for Chicago. But the report series dates back to the late 1950s, and for most years prior to 1990, the city’s private-sector jobs count far exceeded its 2017 tally. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com It is also important to note that state officials say their private-sector jobs report has not been updated since Emanuel spoke last January, so nothing has changed in the intervening months that could make his false claim true based on state figures. Of course, Emanuel did not limit his WTTW comments to private-sector jobs. But his argument would fall just as flat if he meant to refer to the broader measure of all jobs held by Chicagoans—whether inside city limits or not. For example, the Bureau of Labor Statistics pegged Chicago’s preliminary employment numbers for May, the most recent available, at 1,286,424. That is up more than 76,000 from May 2010 during the depth of the Great Recession. But in 2000, BLS numbers for Chicago employment exceeded today’s count by more than 32,000; in 1989 they were more than 60,000 higher; in 1984 more than 103,000 higher; and in 1976 nearly 215,000 greater. Our ruling Emanuel said the city is experiencing its "highest employment since 1950," a variation of a claim he made in January about Chicago’s private-sector employment hitting the highest level in city history. But Chicago has a much smaller population these days than it did in the post-war era, so it stands to reason that jobs numbers would shrink over the decades as well. And they have. Still, the city’s employment picture these days is indisputably brighter than it was just a few years ago. Preliminary federal figures for May show city jobless numbers at 48,602, down from nearly 170,000 in 2010. And the state’s private-sector jobs report, which the mayor’s office gestured to last time around, shows improvement as well—even if it doesn’t match the mayor’s rhetoric. Yet Emanuel continues to dwell on claims of job benchmarks that don’t exist instead of the ones that do. He was wrong the first time we checked him and he is wrong again now. We rate his latest statement False. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Rahm Emanuel	None	None	None	2018-07-09T07:00:00	2018-06-28	['None']
pomt-14198	Says it’s "absurd" to say there’s enough data to establish a link between playing football and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2016/apr/22/jerry-jones/pants-fire-jerry-jones-says-absurd-firmly-link-foo/	The owner of America’s Team says science hasn’t cemented a link between playing football and chronic traumatic brain injury. Jerry Jones got into the tender topic on March 22, 2016, during the NFL’s annual meeting in Boca Raton, Florida, Dallas Cowboys spokesman Rich Dalrymple told us by email. We’d reached out to Dalrymple after seeing a March 23, 2016, news story in The Washington Post quoting Jones saying he’s not convinced medical and scientific research have established a link between football and brain disease. According to the Post, Jones was asked to clarify whether there is, in his view, enough data to establish such a link. "No, that’s absurd," Jones told reporters. "There’s no data that in any way creates a knowledge. There’s no way that you could have made a comment that there is an association and some type of assertion. In most things, you have to back it up by studies. And in this particular case, we all know how medicine is. Medicine is evolving." Dalrymple emailed us a partial transcript indicating Jones was responding to a question about if data shows an established link between football and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, a specific progressive degenerative disease of the brain: REPORTER: "No data, in your mind, to have a relationship between CTE and playing football?" JONES: "No, that's absurd. There's no data that in any way creates knowledge. There's no way that you can have made a comment that there's an association or some type of assertion." Contrasting NFL comments We asked Dalrymple how Jones reached that conclusion. Dalrymple said Jones hadn’t said then and Dalrymple didn’t think there would be follow-up. What Jones said in Florida lined up with a February 2016 response by Dr. Mitch Berger, who leads the NFL’s subcommittee on former players and long-term effects of brain and spine injury. At the time, Berger was asked by Bruce Arthur, a Toronto Star columnist, if he believes the link between football and CTE had been established. He said, "No." But the next month, at a March 14, 2016, roundtable discussion held by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Rep. Jan. Schakowsky, D-Ill., asked Jeff Miller, the NFL’s senior vice president for health and safety, if the link between football and neurodegenerative diseases such as CTE has been established "The answer to that question is certainly yes," Miller replied. An ESPN recap characterized that response as "the first time a senior league official had conceded football's connection to the devastating brain disease." Boston University leads research So, has science established a link between football and CTE? It seems so. For instance, it’s been three years since the publication of "League of Denial," the book by ESPN reporters Mark Fainaru-Wada and Steve Fainaru that walked through research signaling that players who take a pounding on the gridiron--much like boxers, as established decades before--risk brain damage. According to the book, the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at the Boston University School of Medicine, home to neuropathologist Ann McKee, had quickly grown to be recognized as the nation’s leading authority of football-related brain effects--including CTE. The center, which says it collaborates with other institutions, partners and academic researchers to "expand our understanding of CTE," says on its website: "CTE has been known to affect boxers since the 1920s. However, recent reports have been published of neuropathologically confirmed CTE in retired professional football players and other athletes who have a history of repetitive brain trauma. "This trauma triggers progressive degeneration of the brain tissue, including the build-up of an abnormal protein called tau," the center says. "These changes in the brain can begin months, years, or even decades after the last brain trauma or end of active athletic involvement. The brain degeneration is associated with memory loss, confusion, impaired judgment, impulse control problems, aggression, depression, and, eventually, progressive dementia." McKee said at a press conference before the Super Bowl in 2009 (seven-plus years ago): "I have never seen this disease in the general population, only in these athletes. It’s a crisis, and anyone who doesn’t recognize the severity of the problem is in tremendous denial." More recently, a March 16, 2016, ESPN news story by the "League of Denial" authors said McKee has diagnosed 176 CTE cases in five years, including 90 of 94 former NFL players whose brains were examined; 45 out of 55 college players; and six out of 26 high school players. "It's overwhelming that this is occurring in professional players; we're just seeing it over and over," McKee said. National research perspective We tried to run Jones’ statement past McKee, hearing back from the center’s Chris Nowinski, a former pro wrestler and author of "Head Games: Football’s Concussion Crisis." By email, Nowinski pointed us to a web post by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, last updated in March 2015, stating the institute’s first "consensus workshop" of CTE scientists the month before had concluded that "thus far, this pathology has only been found in individuals exposed to brain trauma, typically multiple episodes. How common this pathology occurs at autopsy and the nature and degree of trauma necessary to cause this neurodegeneration remain to be determined." Nowinski also noted the March 16, 2016, ESPN news story both noting the scientific consensus and stating that brain bank studies had lately detected CTE "in a large percentage of former high school football players and other athletes" and scans newly showed "signs of the disease in NFL players decades after their retirement. All that said, ESPN reported, Dr. Walter Koroshetz, director of the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, cautioned that much remains unknown about CTE such as how common it is, when and why symptoms develop, and how the disease -- associated with depression, dementia and memory loss -- spreads inside the brain. The story summed up: "Although many questions remain unanswered, the research appears not only to reinforce the connection between repetitive head trauma and CTE, but also suggests that the disease may be prevalent among people in the general population who played contact sports, not just former NFL players." Finally, the story noted an independent analysis of brain tissue from people who had played contact sports and those who had not. Researchers including Kevin Bieniek, a postdoctoral research fellow in the Mayo Clinic's Department of Neuroscience, reviewed 66 brains of people who had played contact sports -- primarily high school and college football, but also boxing, rugby, wrestling and soccer. They also examined the brains of 198 control subjects who hadn’t been exposed to contact sports. And in the end, they spotted CTE signs in the brains of 21 people who played contact sports -- at a rate of almost one in three -- but no such signs in the brains of the people who had not played contact sports. Other scientists We asked a Johns Hopkins medical expert, Kostas Lyketsos, to analyze Jones’ claim. Through Kristin Mears, spokeswoman for the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, Lyketsos emailed this statement: "In my view, there is good evidence to support ‘a link’ between playing football and long-term consequences of traumatic brain injuries such as developing CTE. The science, however, is still very limited in terms of the strength of the link and many other important aspects of this link. The research that would be necessary to clarify these issues is costly and will take a long time to complete." We also connected with Dr. Vassilis Koliatsos, a Johns Hopkins professor of pathology, who said by phone there’s a risk of CTE from any contact sport, including boxing, rugby and ice hockey. "The problem is not whether there is a risk," Koliatsos said, "but how much of a risk there is. The answer is we really don’t know." He said it would help to have a study following people over time bolstered by PET scans to look for tau buildups in the brains of living people. "What we have now is backward data, brains from people who did poorly. We don’t know about people who have done fairly well. That is the scientific issue," Koliatsos said. Our ruling Jones said it’s "absurd" to say there’s enough data to establish a link between playing football and CTE. In fact, scientists have reached consensus establishing this link, though research remains to be done on the degree to which football players and others involved in high-contact activities risk CTE.

pomt-04528	Says Mitt Romney’s investments created zero jobs.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/01/workers-voice/union-backed-ad-says-romneys-investments-created-z/	For some voters, the mail recently brought a flier that said Mitt Romney’s investments created zero jobs. For years we’ve checked empty claims from Republicans that President Barack Obama’s economic stimulus created "zero jobs." Zero job creation makes for a catchy attack. But is it any more accurate about "Romney’s investments" than it was about Obama’s stimulus package? Uh, no. Romney made a personal fortune running private equity and venture capital firm Bain Capital, and super PACs are spending millions to show investments that ended with lost jobs and Bain profits. That’s an incomplete snapshot of Bain’s portfolio — in fact, at least several of Bain's companies mushroomed, creating thousands of jobs. Still, the ads and mailers keep coming, like this one the week of Sept. 17, 2012, from a super PAC associated with the union AFL-CIO. The mailer, spotted by POLITICO, calls Romney’s business model at private equity firm Bain Capital "un-American." It offered a chart titled "Mitt Romney by the numbers," which included this: "0: Number of jobs that Romney’s investments created." Zero? A footnote says the source is a May 21, 2012, article published by Businessweek.com. Eddie Vale, communications director for Workers’ Voice, pointed us to the final paragraphs of a BloombergBusinessweek story titled "Mitt Romney's Private Equity Nightmare." The story paraphrases a former Romney colleague at Bain as saying, "the main goal at buyout firms ... is never maximizing employment. ... It’s maximizing returns for investors." Vale said that was the point of the chart. "The goal of Romney’s investments was to maximize profits, not create jobs. We are not saying he never created a job. He needs people to feed his dressage horse and wash his cars," Vale said. "We are saying his investments were about maximizing profit. He did that by laying off workers and sending jobs overseas." But that doesn’t mean Romney’s investments created "0" jobs. Private equity vs. venture capital In fact, sometimes Bain profits and jobs grew together. Romney has repeatedly claimed that Bain was a job creator. "In the business I had, we invested in over 100 different businesses and net-net, taking out the ones where we lost jobs and those that we added, those businesses have now added over 100,000 jobs." Independent journalists, including us, haven’t been able to confirm that "net-net" Bain investments added 100,000 jobs. Bain won’t release enough information to do the math. But here are some things we do know. Sometimes Bain acted as a private equity firm, buying stakes in businesses, taking out loans to retool the companies and pay themselves fees, then selling their stakes at a profit. Thousands of workers lost their jobs. But some studies show that private equity in general results in minimal net job loss. Companies shed jobs, but mostly make it up with hiring later. Then there are the times that Bain acted as a venture capitalist, investing in young companies to help them grow. (Something that generally requires hiring workers, not laying them off.) That’s the case for companies like Staples, an example Romney loves to cite. And for good reason. Here are the most widely reported Bain job gains and losses, as rounded up by FactCheck.org from POLITICO and the New York Times: • Romney's campaign says three companies in which Bain invested alone have created more than 100,000 jobs: Staples (89,000), Sports Authority (15,000) and Domino's (7,900 jobs added since 1999). That's 111,900 jobs. (Two of those were venture capital investments; Domino’s was a private equity buyout.) • Companies that lost jobs include American Pad & Paper (385), Dade International (1,900), DDi Corp. (2,100), Clear Channel Communications (2,500) and KB Toys (3,400). That's 10,285 jobs. Other roundups with a narrower time frame — the years before Romney retired — also show tens of thousands of new jobs, and fewer job losses. None of these tallies is comprehensive. There’s also a fair question whether Romney deserves credit for all jobs gained — or blame for jobs lost. Some commentators say the issue isn’t that Bain companies shed jobs, but that they shed "good jobs." But this ad went way beyond that thoughtful criticism. It said his investments’ job creation was zero. Our ruling Workers’ Voice says the "number of jobs that Romney’s investments created" is zero. That ignores Bain’s role as a venture capital firm that helped build companies that hired tens of thousands of workers. The PAC, unable to provide data to back up its claim, said the goal of Romney’s investments wasn’t jobs, but profits. That doesn’t prove Bain’s job creation was zero. Nor do examples of Romney investments that lost jobs. This catchy claim comes up empty. We rate it Pants on Fire.	None	Workers' Voice	None	None	None	2012-10-01T14:15:04	2012-09-17	['None']
pomt-08289	The Fulton County vote count will be finished by 11:30 p.m. on election night.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2010/nov/05/barry-garner/fulton-elections-chief-pledged-quick-tallies/	You might say that a politician didn't make this election season's boldest promise. The head of Fulton County's Department of Registration and Elections did. In an article Tuesday in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Barry Garner vowed his office would report its results at a decent hour. "By 11:30 p.m., we'll be finished, " Garner said. "That's my pledge." We gasped. Fulton? Finishing early? Did he remember the 2008 elections? This is AJC PolitiFact Georgia's 100th take on the truth. The trusty Truth-O-Meter debuted in June, just as the state's primary battles began to heat up. Therefore there are few more fitting ways to celebrate this milestone than by fact-checking results from our first election season. So let's review Fulton's problems in 2008. Back then, another elections director was in charge. Absentee ballot processing went so slowly that Fulton County had to hire FedEx to ship nearly 4,000 ballots to voters overnight. FedEx billed the county more than $300,000. Poll workers counted absentee ballots for 53 hours after closing. State election rules require they stay on site until the count is finished, but crews were so exhausted they were sent home. The Georgia Secretary of State's Office blamed poor staffing and procedures. Because Fulton's count lagged, the U.S. Senate race took an odd turn. Democratic challenger Jim Martin and Republican incumbent Saxby Chambliss continued to campaign after the general election even though it was unclear whether they would compete in a runoff. They did go to a runoff, which Chambliss won. Fulton hired Garner the next year, after a half-dozen other candidates either rejected the job or didn't work out for other reasons. Garner, who came from Florida's Miami-Dade County, promised major changes. "We are not going to be the laughingstock of the election community anymore, " Garner said. "I guarantee you that. We will turn this thing round." Still, even before Tuesday, Fulton ran into trouble. Garner's office sent absentee ballots with incorrect precinct information to more than 200 voters. That's why his confidence piqued our curiosity. Could Fulton really make its self-imposed 11:30 p.m. deadline? Was Garner capable of a turnaround? We called Garner the day after the election. He clarified that he promised if the polls closed as scheduled at 7 p.m., his office would post results online by 11:30 p.m. He didn't tell poll managers about the goal. On Tuesday, 329 of the county's 333 precincts had sent their results to the Election Department's servers by Garner's deadline. That's 98.7 percent. It takes five or 10 minutes to transfer them to the Web, so numbers from slower precincts likely came online between 11:35 and 11:40 p.m. "With a few tweaks, we can meet our goal," he said. The four precincts that didn't make it experienced unusually high turnout. They remained open until the last voter in line by 7 p.m. finished. That happened at 9 p.m. Once voting is done, poll workers must complete state-mandated procedures before sending their results. There were no voting machine problems, Garner said. The county began transmitting its full election night tally to the Secretary of State's Office by about 1:30 a.m. They arrived by about 2 a.m., Secretary of State spokesman Matt Carrothers confirmed. There were no problems with transmission, tabulation or other issues. "This was pretty much in line with ... larger-population counties," Carrothers said. Fulton has made other improvements since 2008. The absentee ballots that caused so many problems were almost all done Tuesday night, Garner said. Those that weren't took extra time because they were twice as long. "Still, we should have been finished," Garner said. The election isn't officially over, of course. Military and overseas absentee ballots aren't due until the close of business Friday. And Garner is already thinking about the future. He hopes to meet his goal in 2012. "If we can do it in Florida, we can do it in Georgia," Garner said. We hope so. It can't get worse than Florida, home of the hanging chad. Overall, we found that Fulton County did well. The only precincts that missed the 11:30 p.m. cutoff kept their doors open late because of high turnout. Garner's promise was that he'd be finished by then if polls closed as scheduled, so it's fair to say he met his goal. Since workers counted almost all absentee ballots Tuesday night, results from precincts that closed on schedule arrived on time. Tallies appeared on the Web within minutes of deadline, and the department came extremely close to meeting Garner's high expectations. That makes Garner's statement Mostly True.

pomt-12557	"As chairman of the Fulton board of commissioners, I turned a $100 million deficit into a balanced budget."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2017/apr/14/karen-handel/karen-handels-dicey-balanced-budget-claim/	In the special election to fill Tom Price’s former House seat, Republican Karen Handel often reminds voters of a key line in her political resume. "As chairman of the Fulton board of commissioners, I turned a $100 million deficit into a balanced budget," she said in an 11Alive news report. The claim is the second sentence on her biography page on her website. Which raises the question: Did Handel actually turn a $100 million deficit into a balanced budget? The short answer is that while Handel was able to help balance the county budget without raising taxes, her specific claim ignores some critical facts about the Fulton County budget process. Let’s step back in time. Diving into the ‘deficit’ Handel took over as chair of the county commissioners on Nov. 12, 2003. Two days later, she was handed a proposed 2004 budget. It was a balanced budget because by law, it had to be. But in two of the county’s largest funds, the general fund and the special services district fund, the original budget planners saw spending topping revenues by a combined total of nearly $90 million. They didn’t call those deficits; they called them shortfalls. But the concept is similar. Additional shortfalls in other funds added well over $10 million to the gap, giving us the $100 million "deficit" in Handel’s claim. To keep the budget balanced, that original plan took $12 million from the county’s cash reserves (to boost the general fund) and raised property taxes by about $75 million. To be clear, the difference is not that Handel took an unbalanced budget and fixed it. Rather, she took a different approach to balancing the budget — which, again, by law, the commission had to do each year. Looking at news reports in January 2004, Handel gets credit for using a mix of spending cuts and deeper draws into cash reserves to deliver a balanced budget that avoided a property tax increase. Overall, her budget plan reduced spending by $46 million from the plan she saw when she took office. But that still didn’t close the gap between spending and revenues. The gap was half of what she started with. She filled that gap, not with more property taxes, but with money saved from past years and kept in reserve. In the words of a Jan. 22, 2004, Atlanta Journal Constitution article, "The budget calls for $49 million in deficit spending that pulls Fulton's two savings accounts below commission-mandated minimums." (Ultimately, the funds didn't dip as low as expected.) We spoke with Handel and her spokeswoman Kate Constantini. They rejected the idea that her plan included a "deficit" but agreed with the numbers. "I came in and got the budget in place so we didn't need to raise taxes," Handel said. "We did that through savings and realignment across the various funds." The Atlanta Journal Constitution praised her at the time. In an editorial, it called her plan "reasonable and even handed." "In this era of cruel budget-cutting in the face of dropping revenue, it’s a rare opportunity to adopt a spending plan that supports good services but doesn’t soak the taxpayers," it said. Our ruling Handel said she turned a $100 million deficit into a balanced budget when she became chair of the Fulton County board of commissioners. Certain parts of that story add up: The expected shortfall was over $100 million. Handel’s budget was balanced, and did so without a tax increase. However, her talking point omits that the county required balanced budgets — and the spending plan she was handed was balanced in the first place. Furthermore, if Handel called the $100 million in the original plan a deficit, then the same label would apply to the 2004 budget that she spearheaded. Her balanced plan also factored in a $49 million shortfall, even after spending cuts. The biggest difference is she avoided a hefty tax hike by drawing more from reserves. Words matter. Handel’s statement ignores that she was required to balance the budget, and her definition of deficit is inconsistent. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-04593	Says U.S. Senate candidate Tommy Thompson "admitted" that Washington, D.C., "changed" him into an insider selling his influence to make millions from powerful special interests.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/sep/21/democratic-senatorial-campaign-committee/democratic-group-says-thompson-admitted-washington/	Democrats and their allies are working overtime to convince Wisconsin voters that former Gov. Tommy Thompson isn’t the man he used to be. Three new ads use Thompson’s own words in building a case that the U.S. Senate candidate changed for the worse after leaving President George W. Bush’s cabinet and making millions in part by working on behalf of drug companies, financial firms and other interests. One spot, by the political arm of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal workers uses a snippet of a Thompson quote -- "... Washington changed us …" -- to bookend allegations that he’s changed so much he now "supports massive tax cuts for corporations that outsource Wisconsin jobs." Another spot, by Tammy Baldwin, the Democrat seeking the Senate seat, uses it in support of an allegation regarding Thompson and drug companies. The newest ad, by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, uses the same snippet to say Thompson "admitted" being a guy who flew off to D.C. and "hasn’t looked back." The list of grievances in the DSCC ad is long. Amid generic images of corporate deal-making, the spot says Thompson "sold his influence and connections, becoming a partner in a powerful Washington lobbying firm, working for Wall Street and the big drug companies, making millions from the special interests at our expense." It skips any mention of Thompson’s four-year stint running the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services before he went to work in 2005 as a legal partner at the Washington, D.C., lobbying firm of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld. The ad ends with the narrator saying, "Thompson even admitted…" before the screen cuts to Thompson remarking at a presidential debate during his 2008 run: "Washington changed us." Narrator: "Yes it did." Just what was Thompson owning up to in the quote? Return with us to the June 5, 2007 CNN-sponsored presidential debate in Manchester, New Hampshire. John Lewicke, an electrical engineer, posed this long question to a candidate panel that included Thompson and current nominee Mitt Romney: "In 2006, we saw the worst Republican defeat in living memory. If we do more of the same, why do we expect anything different? And I'd like to ask each of the candidates why their position is -- or how their position differs from the present administration's, so that we won't see a repeat of 2006 in 2008." A transcript shows the candidates gave answers along two themes: Curb spending (unlike Bush) and show some vision. Few gave any details on spending cuts, other than to suggest banning pork-barrel projects. Ron Paul said the Iraq War costs were too high. Enter Thompson, questioned by CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. BLITZER: "The question is what - what's President Bush's biggest mistake over these past several years?" THOMPSON: "Because we went to Washington to change Washington and Washington changed us. We didn't come up with new ideas. We got to transform health care. We got to wind -- we got to wind down the war in Iraq. We got to make sure that we really are conservatives. If we're going to spend money like - as foolishly and as stupidly as the Democrats, the voters are going to vote for the professional spending, the Democrat not the amateur spender, the Republican." (Laughter, applause.) There was no commentary on Thompson’s private-sector jobs. Rather, it seems clear Thompson’s "admission" concerned his regrets, however belated, over policy and budget matters during his days in the Bush cabinet. But the DSCC uses the quote in the ad to give the false impression Thompson was standing in self-judgment over his work at the time for Akin Gump and others. When asked about the quote, DSCC spokesman Matt Canter connected the dots this way: Most observers, he argued, would say that the new Medicare prescription drug benefit created with Thompson’s support under Bush was a giveaway to the big pharmaceutical companies. Thompson’s debate remarks talked about the failure to transform health care. Therefore, Thompson’s "Washington changed us" was an admission that such deals with special interests were wrong, Canter said. To be sure, there is a connection between Thompson’s cabinet experience and his subsequent private work. PolitiFact Wisconsin has noted that connection in earlier items -- and those items are cited as a source for many of the statements in the ad. We noted the connection when we checked a claim by Thompson’s GOP primary rival Eric Hovde that Thompson is "a big corporate lobbyist" and has been "lobbying during the middle of the campaign." We rated that Half True, noting that Thompson is not a registered lobbyist under the strict definition but "has sold his influence and connections to firms to whom it would benefit on Capitol Hill, but did so in a way -- as a consultant -- to avoid having to register." His link to these firms is clear, and his own disclosure reports show he has made millions in the private sector as a corporate consultant and advisor, executive, investor and speaker. But we’re examining the claim that Thompson candidly "admitted" being "changed" by Washington into a corporate influence peddler. Our rating In claiming that Thompson "admitted" he had been changed by Washington and had sold out to make millions, the ad jumbles a snippet from a quote about the failings of himself and other GOP officials while running Washington with his actions after leaving government service. The effect is to make it appear Thompson is condemning his own conduct and private-sector work. We rate the claim False.

pomt-13369	"These people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens. Ended up becoming citizens. And it was 800. And now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they don't even know."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/29/donald-trump/trump-says-1800-people-who-were-going-be-deported-/	Right before the first presidential debate wrapped up, Donald Trump repeated his desire to "make America great again" and his views that the current state of the country is not good. "We are a nation that is seriously troubled. We're losing our jobs. People are pouring into our country," Trump said. "The other day, we were deporting 800 people. And perhaps, they pressed the wrong button, or perhaps worse than that, it was corruption. But these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens -- ended up becoming citizens. And it was 800. And now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they don't even know." We wanted to know more about the hundreds of people Trump said became citizens instead of being deported. His campaign pointed to a CNN article published Sept. 20 about a report from the Inspector General of the Homeland Security Department about 858 immigrants who were supposed to be deported but were granted U.S. citizenship instead. "But the truth is the report is even worse than reported, with more than 1,800 individuals naturalized who should have been deported from the country," the CNN article said. Inspector General’s report The Inspector General of the Homeland Security Department issued a report Sept. 8 about "potentially ineligible individuals" being granted U.S. citizenship due to incomplete fingerprint records. Immigrants applying to become naturalized U.S. citizens are required to submit fingerprints, reveal other identities or names used and if they have been in deportation proceedings. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) then runs the applicant’s fingerprints against DHS and FBI digital fingerprint databases to check for other possible identities, criminal arrests and convictions, immigration violations, deportations and links to terrorism. If there’s a match, USCIS determines whether the applicant is still eligible for naturalization. The Inspector General’s office determined that 1,029 people had become citizens even though they had final deportation orders under another identity. Of the 1,029 individuals, 858 did not have digital fingerprint records available in DHS’ fingerprint repository when USCIS was reviewing and deciding on their applications, the report said. (For comparison, roughly 701,000 people receive naturalization each year.) The people who received citizenship may have had old paper-based fingerprint records, but those are missing from DHS’ digital repository. Those old records were not digitized and uploaded into it when the repository was initially developed in 1994, the report said. The vast majority of those paper-based records are from the 1990s, DHS said. The Inspector General’s report does not specify the years when the individuals became naturalized citizens. The CNN article referenced by Trump’s campaign emphasized a footnote on the report, which said that as of November 2015, an additional 953 people had been naturalized while being subject to final deportation orders. The footnote said it was not known when the fingerprints of the 953 people were digitized or how many of their records were available in DHS’ digital files when their applications were being examined and decided. It seems likely the actual number of people ordered deported but who became U.S. citizens is actually 1,982 (the 1,029 plus the 953 identified in the footnote), said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank favoring restrictions on immigration. "So Trump was actually understating the results," Krikorian said. A DHS spokesman said a review team is looking into hard copies of each file identified in the Inspector General’s report. A total of 1,811 cases are being reviewed -- the 858 for whom digitized records were not available during the naturalization process, and the 953 for whom it’s not known if their digital records were in the system when their applications were being reviewed and decided. DHS said more investigation is needed before it can be determined if people were naturalized when they shouldn’t have been. "It is important to note that the fact that fingerprint records in these cases may have been incomplete at the time of the naturalization interview does not necessarily mean that the applicant was in fact granted naturalization, or that the applicant obtained naturalization, fraudulently," said Neema Hakim, DHS spokesman. Hakim said the ongoing review found approximately 100 cases among those identified in the OIG report where the individuals were not in fact granted citizenship. Lack of digitized fingerprints During the debate, Trump said hundreds of immigrants who were to be deported became citizens perhaps because officials "pressed the wrong button, or perhaps worse than that, it was corruption." The Inspector General’s report does not outline corruption as a reason, but a lack of modernized records. "As long as the older fingerprint records have not been digitized and included in the repositories, USCIS risks making naturalization decisions without complete information and, as a result, naturalizing additional individuals who may be ineligible for citizenship or who may be trying to obtain U.S. citizenship fraudulently," the report said. Immigrants who become naturalized U.S. citizens can petition for others to come to the United States, may obtain security clearances or perform security-sensitive work (as was the case of three naturalized citizens identified in the report, their credentials have been revoked). Our ruling Trump said, "These people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens. Ended up becoming citizens. And it was 800. And now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they don't even know." Trump’s statement accurately references a CNN report that at least 1,800 people who had deportation orders had become naturalized U.S. citizens. An Inspector General report found that old paper records hadn’t been transferred to modern digital databases. There are a few details worth noting. An ongoing review found that about 100 cases identified in the Inspector General’s report were actually not granted citizenship. And, having a previous final deportation order does not always make an individual ineligible for naturalization. Trump’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/18e57605-51ba-4f32-a73e-f43c20b62112	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-09-29T13:48:17	2016-09-26	['None']
pomt-08874	"Ohio lost 400,000 jobs on his (Ted Strickland’s) watch."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2010/aug/03/republican-governors-association/republican-governors-association-says-ohio-lost-40/	Like the refrain of a ubiquitous pop song, the phrase -- "Ohio lost 400,000 jobs on his watch" -- is playing over and over on the airwaves. And like any good lyric, the phrase is catchy. Republican U.S. Senate candidate Rob Portman sings it about his Democratic challenger Lee Fisher, who is Ohio’s lieutenant governor and former head of the state’s economic development department. Republican gubernatorial candidate John Kasich sings it about incumbent governor Ted Strickland. Now the Republican Governors Association has made the phrase the central theme of three commercials attacking Strickland on behalf of Kasich. "Ohio lost 400,000 jobs on his watch," is the opening line for one of the ads. With the phrase getting aired so often, we thought it was time to check the accuracy of the playlist. The Republicans are referring to the state’s net job losses since Strickland -- and by extension Fisher -- took office in January 2007. Ohio lost 386,600 non-farm jobs from January 2007 through June of this year, the latest figure available. So Republicans are largely accurate when they say Ohio has lost 400,000 jobs since January of 2007. Job losses were as high as 438,900 at the end of February of this year. But the claim breaks down when Republicans suggest that the governor -- or any one official -- is responsible for the job losses. Ohio has been losing jobs since January of 2000 - 568,300 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Of those, 403,800 came in the manufacturing sector. It’s also worth noting, since campaigns are trying to blame those in charge when the state lost jobs, that Republicans held the governor’s office seven of those years and held both houses of the legislatures until January 2009. Republican George W. Bush was president for eight of those years. Strickland argues that Ohio - like Michigan and other Midwest states -- was especially hurt by forces beyond his control, namely a recession and the decline of manufacturing. Ohio and the nation have suffered through two recessions, one that started in 2001 and one that started in 2008, which triggered an avalanche of job losses here and was considered a global economic crisis. Strickland is not the only one making this argument. Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, a Republican elected in 2004 who is in his second term, says the same thing, at least he did July 22 during an interview in Cleveland. What makes the Daniels’ comments worth highlighting is that the rising GOP star was in town campaigning with Kasich. The two were beating up on Strickland for the state’s job losses. But Daniels became a bit defensive when questioned about Hoosier State less than stellar performance in the last several years. Indiana lost 174,000 net jobs since January of 2007 and the state has a current unemployment rate of 10.1 percentage points compared to Ohio’s 10.5 rate. "In a time when every state that is not sitting on a pile of natural gas is struggling, you bet we are," Daniels said. He argued that Indiana is adding jobs faster than other states and its "business climate" is better than Ohio’s. But, echoing the sentiments of other governors in defense of their states’ economic woes, he said, "To some extent, everybody is at the mercy of national and global events, and we are no different." That’s right. Daniels delivered the line that many Democrats make to defend themselves from the charge that the state’s job losses are all their fault. So even if the campaign phrase -- "Ohio lost 400,000 jobs on his watch" -- is stuck in a voter’s head, the claim does not reflect the larger economic backdrop, one that both Democrats and Republicans in charge of states admit produced results out of their control. If the roles were reversed, and Ohio were led by a Republican governor and it was Democrats making the accusation, our rating would be the same. We find the Republican Governors Association claim to be Half True. Comment on this item.

pomt-03318	"Our businesses have created nearly twice as many jobs in this recovery as they had at the same point in the last recovery, when there was no Obamacare."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/26/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-businesses-have-created-nearly-t/	During a speech on the economy in Galesburg, Ill., President Barack Obama touted his record on job creation. Referring to his Republican critics, Obama said in the July 24, 2013, speech, "They’ll bring up Obamacare -- this is tried and true -- despite the fact that our businesses have created nearly twice as many jobs in this recovery as businesses had at the same point in the last recovery, when there was no Obamacare." We’ll first check whether Obama is correct about job growth, and then take a look at the impact of Obama’s health care law. The job numbers Because Obama used the term "recovery," we started by looking at Bureau of Labor Statistics job numbers for the first 49 months after the official end of the past two recessions -- that is, from November 2001 until November 2005, when George W. Bush was president, and from June 2009 until June 2013, during Obama’s tenure. Under Obama’s recovery, private-sector employment increased by a little under 6.05 million, compared to 3.17 million during the equivalent period during the Bush recovery. That’s "nearly twice as many jobs," as Obama said. And experts say this is a credible way of measuring the numbers. But it isn’t the only way. Instead of starting the clock at the official end of the recovery, one could start it from the low point in private-sector employment. These aren’t the same dates, because a low point private-sector employment isn’t the determining factor for pinpointing the end of a recession. Using this method makes Obama’s recovery less impressive. During the Bush recovery, private-sector employment continued to tumble all the way to July 2003 -- a year and a half after the recession’s official end. By comparison, during the Obama recovery, private-sector employment began to rise in February 2010, just eight months after the official end of the recession. So the extended slide in private-sector jobs under Bush artificially reduced the number of jobs created during the first part of his recovery. If you count from the low point in private-sector jobs instead, the Bush recovery produced 6.35 million private-sector jobs in the first 41 months, compared to 7.20 million in the first 41 months of Obama’s recovery. That’s modestly more private-sector jobs under Obama -- but it’s not "nearly twice as many jobs," as he had said. There’s also a third way to look at it -- looking at all jobs, not just private-sector jobs. Using this measurement casts an even more unfavorable light on the Obama recovery, since the government sector has been among the hardest-hit of any job category in the current recession. If you start counting private and government jobs from the low point in employment, the Bush recovery generated slightly more than 7 million total jobs, which actually exceeds the 6.58 million jobs created in the Obama recovery. Two economists we interviewed -- Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution and Tara Sinclair of George Washington University -- agreed that the alternative measurements are also valid. But by choosing the more favorable of the two statistics, Sinclair said, "I think he's cherry-picking. To in any way claim that this labor market is better than what we had in the mid-2000s just doesn't sound fair to me." To be fair, Burtless said, Obama did acknowledge elsewhere in his speech that, "I’m here to tell you today that we're not there yet. We all know that. We're not there yet. We've got more work to do." The role of Obamacare Obama used the line we’re checking as a way of countering Republican claims that the president’s signature health care law is a job-killer. The reality is that no one knows yet how much of a job-killer the law is going to be, or if it will be a job-killer at all. Many key provisions of the health care law haven’t kicked in yet. That includes new rules with fines for large businesses that don’t provide their employees with health care. Republicans say the new rules could drive some employers to shed employees or turn them into part-time employees. Sinclair said it’s possible that some companies may have pre-emptively cut down on employee hours or laid off workers due to the fear of looming Obamacare mandates, or due to certain Obamacare taxes being imposed. However, even if this is happening, it’s impossible to quantify the impact with any specificity. Obamacare’s impact on the currently available job data -- either positive or negative -- is still highly speculative. Our ruling Obama said, "Our businesses have created nearly twice as many jobs in this recovery as they had at the same point in the last recovery, when there was no Obamacare." Obama’s carefully worded claim uses the most advantageous time frame to measure job growth. Other metrics show that the job recovery he has presided over has been similar to, or even weaker than, the job recovery under Bush. So we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-07390	"State employees are actually going to get a pay raise."	false	/ohio/statements/2011/may/03/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-claims-state-workers-will-get-pay-/	Gov. John Kasich marked his 100th day in office with a news conference highlighting a long list of accomplishments. Among them were introduction of the "Jobs Budget," as he called it, and passage of Senate Bill 5. SB 5, described as "collective bargaining reform," would limit collective bargaining for public employees across the state. Kasich was asked during the meeting with reporters if the economic squeeze on workers and schools and local governments made it important symbolically for state lawmakers to take a pay cut. "I think they should be treated like all other state employees, and state employees are actually going to get a pay raise," the governor answered. A raise? In these times? While closing an $8 billion state budget deficit? PolitiFact Ohio was surprised. We asked the governor's office to explain, and looked for some background information on our own. Members of the General Assembly, we found, receive a base salary of $60,584 -- seventh-highest among state legislatures -- and stipends for leadership positions can raise it toward $90,000. Perks for Ohio lawmakers include public pension benefits and travel reimbursements. House Bill 41, introduced in January by Norwalk Republican Terry Boose, would cut salaries in the General Assembly and for elected executive officeholders by 5 percent. The bill has not yet had a hearing. Even if enacted, it would not affect legislator salaries during their current term of office. Legislators did not take the cut in pay that state employees have had for the past two years in the form of 10 mandatory furlough days, or unpaid days off. The governor's press secretary, Rob Nichols, told us that those days were what Kasich was referring to. "He was talking about the end of furlough days imposed under the previous administration," Nichols said. Kasich will allow the furloughs to end in July, so "state workers will, in fact, get a 3.2 percent pay increase. It's not technically a raise, but state workers are going to be getting more money. They will be getting their full salary," Nichols said. In other words, as the song says, they're going to get right back to where they started from. And where are we? Despite Nichols explanations, there is no pay raise. State workers will be getting more money in their paychecks, as Nichols noted. But that’s not because they’ll be getting paid more for their time. Those increases are a result of them working more days at the same rate of pay. When the furloughs end, state workers will no longer be forced to take unpaid days off from work. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Kasich’s claim as False.	None	John Kasich	None	None	None	2011-05-03T06:00:00	2011-04-19	['None']
pomt-00644	The lack of an automatic braking system that could have prevented the Philadelphia Amtrak crash "wasn't driven by a lack of funding. It just takes a while. They (Congress) just passed it in the recent past."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/may/18/megyn-kelly/did-money-have-nothing-do-amtrak-crash/	In the first hours after the Amtrak crash outside Philadelphia on May 12, 2015, some people looked to blame Congress for failing to fund critical infrastructure improvements. But the talking points changed when the nation learned the engineer was speeding. "Breaking tonight, 106 miles per hour," Megyn Kelly opened her May 13 Fox News show. "That is how fast the NTSB says an Amtrak train was traveling just moments before flying off the rails in Philadelphia last night. And while some of the wounded are still being treated and other passengers are still unaccounted for, there has been a predictable but no less despicable rush to turn this crash into a political talking point." Kelly then played a montage of Democrats and one Oklahoma Republican mayor saying the crash was a wake-up call to invest in infrastructure. Rep. Steve Israel, D-N.Y., said, "Last night we failed them. We failed to invest in their safety." Kelly said this blaming of "stingy Republicans" poured out before the fact was known that the train was more than two-times over the speed limit as it entered a curve. While a technology called positive train control (PTC) could have slowed the train in the case of human error, its absence in the Philadelphia crash, Kelly said, had nothing to do with Congress refusing to allocate money. "Congress had already mandated that it be installed, and it's being installed on all these tracks," Kelly said. "They hadn't gotten to this particular track yet. And according to our information, that wasn't driven by a lack of funding. It just takes a while. They just passed it in the recent past. So they were working on it. So it's not a failure of infrastructure. It's a failure of an engineer to obey the speed limit." The National Transportation Safety Board is continuing to investigate the reason behind the crash. But we wanted to dig into her claim about the lack of positive train control on that section of rail -- and whether congressional funding was an issue. What we found is that yes, Amtrak and Congress have been working for years to implement positive train control. And yes, the braking system -- which National Transportation Safety Board member Robert Sumwalt said would have prevented the crash -- is on schedule to be installed by the end of the year. But money from Congress could have pushed up that timetable, specifically when it comes to purchasing radio frequencies necessary for the braking program to work. The braking system and and the Amtrak crash Positive train control is a system that uses transponders on the tracks to communicate with controls on a passing locomotive. If the train is moving too fast, the system slows it down. Amtrak released a statement after the Philadelphia crash saying that "installation is largely complete south of Newark, N.J., but the system is only in service on 50 miles of the 226-mile route between Washington and New York." The statement said Amtrak is on schedule to have the system fully operational on the Northeast Corridor by the end of 2015. That, Amtrak said, will meet a deadline set by Congress in 2008. Put another way, the hardware for the new braking system was largely in place (though not specifically at the site of the crash). What was left was the final work to connect it to the trains and activate the system. PTC installation and funding The core of Kelly’s claim is that the installation of the PTC braking system was not about funding. To back that up, Fox News sent us a Reuters article about delays in implementing PTC nationwide. "Federal rules require the national rail network to have an operating PTC system by the end of the year, though many lawmakers have endorsed rail industry appeals for more time to comply," the article said. "In March, the Senate Commerce Committee voted to extend the deadline for implementing PTC until at least 2020. Both Republicans and Democrats supported the measure, which will now go to the Senate floor." That extension, however, served the needs of the freight and commuter rail companies who were unable to get their systems up and running by the end of 2015. Amtrak was a different story. David Hughes was Amtrak’s chief engineer until 2005 and now consults in the railroad industry. "Amtrak may be the only major railroad to meet the original 2015 deadline," Hughes told PunditFact. Amtrak’s specific system is called the Advanced Civil Speed Enforcement System. A heavy duty plastic transponder tied to a cross-tie in the track sends speed and location information to the locomotive, which in turn radios that data to a ground control station. If something is going wrong, the ground control station sends a command via radio back to the locomotive, forcing it to slow down. Amtrak had this system fully operational north of New York City, and was close to putting it online in the section between New York City and Washington, D.C. The question is, would money have advanced the timeline? Karl Witbeck is consulting engineer with the Stantec firm. "No doubt the lack of capital funding has paid a large role in the delay of finishing the implementation of PTC for Amtrak," Witbeck said. Witbeck studied a key link in the warning system, the radio communications needed to connect the ground control station with the trains. Witbeck, along with the Federal Railroad Administration and Amtrak’s Office of Inspector General, highlighted the lack of accessible, available radio frequencies as the single greatest barrier to completing the automatic braking system for all railroads, not just Amtrak. In 2012, the Amtrak Office of Inspector General called the radio link the "most serious challenge" to implementing the braking system. Why? When Congress mandated that every railroad in the country have PTC by 2015, it failed to require that the Federal Communication Commission set aside radio frequencies for the railroads to use. That sent railroad operators such as Amtrak out into the private market on a hunt for frequencies. The inspector general report said that Amtrak "faces the prospect of having to stitch together enough licenses in the 220 megahertz (MHz) range through piecemeal acquisitions, county-by-county, to ensure coverage along the NEC (Northeast Corridor)." Acquiring that coverage costs money, and this is where the story gets complicated. In its 2012 report and in a follow-up a year later, Amtrak’s inspector general aimed many criticisms at Amtrak’s inability to manage its capital investment projects. While the 2012 report said a "significant challenge is ensuring that Amtrak has enough funds available to implement PTC fully by the deadline," it underscored that Amtrak needed to request the funds for radio frequencies at least a year and a half before it planned to spend them, and Amtrak didn’t seem to be doing that. The request was missing from the railroad’s five-year financial plan and, according to the report, the cost estimates were "potentially incomplete and unreliable." We also found that Amtrak stopped listing PTC in its Fiscal Year 2014 and 2015 requests to Congress. In 2013, Amtrak’s inspector general skewered managers for failing to set clear priorities for its capital projects. It noted that the board had approved over $3 million to repair locomotives that were due to be replaced. Specific to PTC, it found that while the board had approved spending about $10 million in one year to knit together Amtrak’s system with that of the freight and commuter railroads, managers signed a multiyear contract costing $59 million. Clearly, Amtrak had internal problems managing its capital projects, including the system that could have prevented the fatal crash near Philadelphia. On the other hand, Congress has consistently given Amtrak about 60 percent of the money it requested each year to invest in its infrastructure. Year Amount requested Amount appropriated 2010 $975 million $594 million 2011 $1.02 billion $658 million 2012 $1.1 billion $657 million 2013 $1.4 billion $642 million 2014 $1.2 billion $800 million (Sources: General capital figures in Amtrak business plans, budget requests, and appropriations bills) The inspector general report noted that Amtrak’s "needs have exceeded the level of funding that it received each year." In the view of Hughes and Witbeck, Amtrak has always had to juggle how it would spend its capital budget and resolving the final issue of buying radio bandwidth for PTC was part of that. Our ruling Kelly said that the lack of a working fail-safe braking system at the site of the Philadelphia Amtrak crash, "wasn't driven by a lack of funding. It just takes a while. They (Congress) just passed it in the recent past." Congress actually passed the rule in 2008. The basis of Kelly’s claim was an article that said Congress had granted an extension for railroads to implement a positive train control system. But that extension had much to do with freight and commuter rail operators, not Amtrak. Amtrak is moving forward with its own braking system, and says it will be fully operational by the end of the year. Experts said additional resources to purchase radio frequencies needed to make the system work could have sped up the roll-out. Moreover, while Amtrak has been criticized for how it spends money on capital projects, it has consistently been funded at levels below what it has requested. Kelly’s statement is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.	None	Megyn Kelly	None	None	None	2015-05-18T17:46:22	2015-05-13	['United_States_Congress']
pomt-10553	RNC version of a Hillary Clinton valentine: "Roses are red, violets are blue, I'll raise your taxes and there is nothing you can do."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/14/republican-national-committee-republican/hunk-of-burning-love/	Its presidential nominee all but announced, the Republican National Committee is ready for the next challenge: love note writing. In a feature on its Web site, the RNC offers up free gifts for Valentine's Day. That is, cards from your favorite Democratic opponents. "If I could rearrange the alphabet, I'd put T and AX together," coos a sweet valentine from Sen. Hillary Clinton. "My liberal heart bleeds for you," intones Sen. Barack Obama. Six options await the last-minute shopper — and you can send it to 10 people at once! Many can appreciate the messages' snide sentiments, but here's the problem: While most of the Valentines are cute twists on criticisms of the two candidates, one is simply untrue. It's a Clinton valentine that reads: "Roses are red, violets are blue, I'll raise your taxes and there is nothing you can do." PolitiFact checked an earlier claim from the RNC that Clinton's campaign proposals would cost taxpayers more than $777.6-billion. We found that to be Mostly True. And Clinton has said she supports letting the Bush tax cuts of 2001 expire as scheduled in 2010 for people making more than $250,000 a year. Critics point to that as a sign she plans to raise taxes as president. But it's the "there is nothing you can do" line that draws the Truth-O-Meter's attention. Since when can a president raise taxes without the approval of Congress? And aren't voters encouraged to speak up about policies they oppose? We gave a Pants on Fire ruling to former presidential candidate John Edwards when he claimed king-like powers for the presidency. The RNC now makes a similar claim. Maybe the RNC should stick to the biting sarcasm of such sentiments as "On this Valentine's Day ... may higher taxes come your way!" (a Clinton card offering) or "Will you be my Valentine? Yes ... no ... present" (a shot at Obama's voting record in the Illinois state Senate). Or consider adding fact sheets with footnotes to its Valentines. For this day, it's Pants on Fire wrong.

pomt-14750	"Two months ago, Donald Trump said that ISIS was not our fight."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/15/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-claims-cnn-debate-donald-trump-said-isis-/	Republican presidential candidates Jeb Bush and Donald Trump faced off over what Trump did -- or didn’t -- say about ISIS during the CNN debate in Las Vegas. Bush said, "Two months ago, Donald Trump said that ISIS was not our fight. Just two months ago." Trump responded, "Never said that." Who’s right? We dug into the archives and found two quotes that shed some light on what Trump really said. The comments that fit squarely within Bush’s time frame came on Sept. 28, 2015, when Trump sat for an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett. Here’s an excerpt from Trump’s comments: "(Syria is) a total catastrophe. It's a total mess, and we are helping to make it a mess. Now, we have ISIS and ISIS wants to go after (Syrian president Bashar al-Assad). But we're knocking the hell out of them even though it's not a very full blown thing. We're still dropping bombs all over the place. ... "You have Russia that is now there. Russia is on the side of Assad and Russia wants to get rid of ISIS as much as we do, if not more, because they don't want them coming into Russia. And I'm saying, why are we knocking ISIS and yet at the same time, we're against Assad? Let them fight, take over the remnants, but more importantly, let Russia fight ISIS if they want to fight them. Let them fight it. ... "Let Syria and ISIS fight. Why do we care? Let ISIS and Syria fight. And let Russia, they're in Syria already, let them fight ISIS. Look, I don't want ISIS. ISIS is bad. They are evil. When they start doing with a head chopping … these are really bad dudes. … Let Russia take care of ISIS. How many places can we be? … Russia likes Assad seemingly a lot. Let them worry about ISIS. Let them fight it out." When we checked with the Bush campaign, spokesman Matt Gorman said that the interview with Burnett was indeed the source that Bush was referencing during his debate comments. As it happens, another set of comments actually offer a closer fit in wording to what Bush referenced, but they came more than five months ago, in a July 8, 2015, interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper. Here’s what Trump told Cooper when he asked him to expand upon his previous remark that nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump: "The situation with ISIS has to be dealt firmly and strongly. When you have people being beheaded -- I would love not to be over there. That's not our fight. That's other people's fight. That's revolutions, that's whatever you want to call it, religious wars." So it appears that Bush conflated two examples of prior Trump comments. In the quote from "two months ago," Trump didn’t say that ISIS is "not our fight." He did, however, say those words on a different occasion -- but that was more than five months ago, not two. More important, though, is whether Bush accurately captured the essence of Trump’s meaning. In the quote from two months ago -- the one the Bush camp says he was referencing in the debate exchange -- Trump does appear to suggest that Russia and Syria should be the countries to primarily fight ISIS. "Let Syria and ISIS fight," he said. "Why do we care? Let ISIS and Syria fight. And let Russia, they're in Syria already, let them fight ISIS." Our ruling Bush said, "Two months ago, Donald Trump said that ISIS was not our fight" -- something Trump immediately denied. Trump didn't use those words two months ago -- even though he did five months ago -- but in the comments from two months ago, Trump said something close to what Bush indicated. We rate Bush’s comment Mostly True.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2015-12-15T23:02:54	2015-12-15	['None']
pomt-07478	"When we lower tax rates, we generate more in revenues. That happened in '86 with the Reagan plan, happened in 2001, following the Bush plan."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/apr/15/saxby-chambliss/chambliss-makes-case-tax-cuts-citing-reagan-and-bu/	Georgia’s senior U.S. senator recently talked about one of the biggest problems facing the federal government -- the national debt -- and offered some solutions. Saxby Chambliss called for lowering personal income tax rates and corporate tax rates. He then gave a history lesson about how that has worked. "When we lower tax rates, we generate more in revenues," Chambliss, a Republican, told National Public Radio. "That happened in '86 with the Reagan plan, happened in 2001, following the Bush plan. So we know that's going to happen." Chambliss repeated this Monday in a presentation to the Rotary Club of Atlanta. "What we’ve always seen in this country is whether it was the ‘86 tax package or the 2001 tax package, revenues go up whenwe reduce [tax] rates," the senator said. We wondered whether Chambliss was correct. Chambliss was referring to two major tax changes by two Republican presidents: Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. In 1986, Reagan persuaded Congress to gradually cut the top individual income tax rate from 50 percent to 28 percent and the top corporate tax rate from 46 percent to 34 percent by 1988. In March 2001, Congress passed the first of several Bush administration tax cuts that he hoped would stimulate the economy. There’s an ongoing debate about whether tax cuts for the wealthy help boost the economy. Most Republicans say tax cuts help business owners invest more in their companies and on workers. Many Democrats argue those in the highest income tax brackets need tax cuts the least. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, reluctantly agreed late last year to extend expiring Bush administration tax cuts for wealthy Americans for an additional two years. Obama said in a speech Wednesday that he wants to end those tax cuts as part of a plan to reduce the debt. Republicans quickly objected. Chambliss spokeswoman Bronwyn Lance Chester said her boss based his comments on federal revenue data from the Office of Management and Budget. The bulk of federal revenue, also called receipts, comes from individual income taxes. A portion comes from businesses in corporate taxes, and some federal revenue comes from taxes on Social Security. The OMB numbers show federal revenue rose from $769 billion in 1986 to $854 billion in 1987, the year after the Reagan-era tax changes were passed. It rose again in 1988 to $909 billion. The revenue change wasn’t as rosy following the 2001 tax cuts. In 2001, revenue was just below $2 trillion. The following year, revenue was $1.85 trillion. In 2003, revenue went even lower to $1.78 trillion. We also looked at revenue as a percentage of the nation’s gross domestic product. The percentage rose from 17.5 percent to 18.4 percent between fiscal years 1986 and 1987. It dropped slightly in 1988 to 18.2 percent. The percentage dropped from 19.5 percent in fiscal year 2001 to 17.6 percent in fiscal year 2002 and 16.2 percent in fiscal year 2003. The federal fiscal year runs from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30. Eric Toder, a former official in the U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service and the Congressional Budget Office, noted that the Reagan-era tax rate changes were not aimed at raising revenue, which is consistent with news reports from 1986. As for the Bush tax cuts, Toder, an institute fellow at the Washington-based Urban Institute, said it’s not accurate to claim there was an increase in revenue, pointing to the OMB’s revenue figures. Lance Chester told us revenue increases were "delayed due to the economic recession at the time." "But revenues did show a steady increase afterward," she added in an e-mail. Total revenue did not increase until 2004, according to the OMB data. Revenue as a percentage of the gross domestic product did not rise again until fiscal year 2005, OMB data show. We asked Toder and Sally Wallace, the chairwoman of Georgia State University’s economics department, whether Chambliss should get a pass on what he said about the Bush tax cuts, taking into consideration the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. They both said no, arguing it did not have a devastating impact on the economy. We were curious about what happened after another recent disaster in America. In fiscal year 2006, the year after Hurricane Katrina, revenue and its percentage of the gross domestic product actually increased, OMB data show. Wallace, a former Treasury Department official, looked at data from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Brookings Institution, a well-known independent public policy foundation. Her numbers were slightly different with OMB’s but also led her to the conclusion that revenue rose in 1987 and fell in 2002. Wallace disagreed with the Chambliss camp’s argument about the recession’s impact on 2002 revenue, noting that they were still down in 2003 when the economy showed signs of growth. "Revenue should have rebounded after 2003, but it did not," she told us. We believe Chambliss is correct to say that federal revenue did rise after Reagan lowered individual income tax rates, but we note that his plan was aimed at being revenue-neutral. The numbers show federal revenue declined in the first two years after the 2001 Bush administration tax cuts, so the senator’s statement is off. The senator’s statement is partially accurate, but it omits some important details. Therefore, we rate it as Half-True.

pomt-03478	Currently, the intelligence community "can collect business records on law-abiding Americans who have no connection to terrorism."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/13/mark-udall/udall-says-americans-business-records-caught-surve/	While most Americans seem ready to support intelligence agencies casting a wide net against terrorists, they have some concerns about the scope of domestic surveillance. Congress began hearings on the surveillance of phone calls and Internet traffic that became public last week. On June 9, 2013, ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos aired footage of comments from Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo. In a floor speech roughly two years ago, Udall urged his colleagues to narrow the reach of the USA Patriot Act, one of the key legal tools that allow the United States to gather intelligence. Udall had been briefed on the program that stored data on millions of phone calls made in the United States, but secrecy rules prohibited him from offering details. Instead, he warned broadly that the intelligence community "can collect business records on law-abiding Americans who have no connection to terrorism." Udall’s office affirmed that they still reflect the senator’s position. So we wondered whether the law allows the intelligence community to legally "collect business records on law-abiding Americans who have no connection to terrorism." Udall cited Section 215 of the Patriot Act as the relevant part of the law. This provision was reportedly the one used by the government to obtain a broad sweep of "metadata" -- information on phone numbers, call durations and other information short of the actual conversations -- from Verizon customers. Section 215 allows the FBI to require "the production of any tangible things (including books, records, papers, documents, and other items) for an investigation to protect against international terrorism." However, the government faces some limits. The FBI must demonstrate to a special court, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, that it has reasonable grounds to believe that the tangible things being sought are relevant to an investigation involving terrorism. Approval must be renewed every three months. The law also requires steps to limit access to information beyond the scope of the investigation. After the Guardian published its article on the gathering of millions of phone records from Verizon customers, the director of national intelligence, James Clapper, addressed the "business records" provision of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Clapper said the "program does not allow the government to listen in on anyone’s phone calls. The information acquired does not include the content of any communications or the identity of any subscriber. The only type of information acquired under the court’s order is telephony metadata, such as telephone numbers dialed and length of calls," Clapper said in a written statement. Gen. Keith Alexander, the head of the National Security Agency, acknowledged in a Senate hearing on June 12 that the NSA has collected millions of records under section 215. In short, the program that obtained the data on Verizon customers was deemed legal by the FISA court, and it produced what the government considered "business records" -- specifically, metadata. Information on millions of Americans was accessed, almost all of whom had no connection to terrorism. Udall’s claim appears accurate. Congress wrote the law and key lawmakers were kept apprised of the program; the FISA court approved it, apparently on multiple occasions. Former Sen. Bob Graham of Florida, an Intelligence Committee chairman until 2005, said the ongoing activity speaks to the soundness of its legal footing. "It is being done," Graham said. "Given the fact that it has not been successfully challenged in the courts, that would suggest that it is within the agency’s authority to do so." Steve Vladeck, professor of law at the American University Washington College of Law, concurred that the law seems to be on the government’s side. "Section 215 of the Patriot Act only requires that the data be ‘relevant’ to a national security/terrorism investigation, not that the individual whose data is seized have such a connection," Vladeck said. Still, we’ll point out a few things. First, just because the government is doing it and a court is approving it doesn’t mean that the metadata-collection program will be upheld as constitutional indefinitely. The American Civil Liberties Union has already begun to challenge the program, for instance. And the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a group focused on the intersection of technology and personal liberties, charged in a letter to Congress that the FISA court had overstepped its authority. The group said the government had failed to provide "reasonable grounds" for the collection of millions of Verizon telephone records. Second, there’s a distinction between collecting data and sifting through it. While the government has been storing phone call information in a giant database, it cannot legally access that information willy-nilly. Before it can drill down into actual phone calls, it has to meet a higher legal standard: The government must convince the court that it has a clear and reasonable suspicion that the calls are relevant to terrorist activity. Supporters of the program including the White House and lawmakers cite the need to get specific permission for database queries as an essential protection of individual privacy. Our ruling Udall said that currently, the intelligence community "can collect business records on law-abiding Americans who have no connection to terrorism." Recent news reports, which prompted acknowledgements by U.S. officials, confirm that intelligence agencies have been gathering a vast amount of phone metadata, which they argue falls under the category of business records. This metadata can be "collected" -- as Udall phrased it -- though it’s important to note that this data cannot be utilized directly in an investigation until a more stringent legal standard is met. Meanwhile, common sense tells us that millions of Americans who are having their metadata collected are not involved in terrorism, further bolstering Udall’s claim. Because this program was approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, it is, in a de facto sense, legal. That doesn’t mean the program wouldn’t be vulnerable to court challenges in the future, but until that happens, we rate the statement True.

pomt-07259	Says Republican-approved changes to "make it more difficult to participate in Ohio elections include reducing in-person early voting from 35 days to six."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/may/27/armond-budish/state-rep-armond-budish-says-gop-approved-changes-/	Ohio’s Republican-led House recently passed a set of voting regulations that overhaul the state’s elections system. The proposed changes in House Bill 194 include allowing voters to change their address online, requiring people casting provisional ballot to provide additional forms of identity, eliminating the requirement that poll workers direct voters in the wrong precinct to the correct one and prohibiting elections boards from mailing absentee ballots to voters. Among the controversial changes are new limits on early voting, which Democrats say amount to voter suppression. Republicans say the state needs more uniform voting regulations and less costly ways to manage elections. Under the bill, voting by mail is cut to 21 days before an election, from 35 now. And in-person voting would be restricted to 10 days before an election. This last point was one of several Democratic House Leader Armond Budish of Beachwood, railed against in a news release on May 18, the day the bill passed along party lines. "Changes in House Bill 194 that make it more difficult to participate in Ohio elections include reducing in-person early voting from 35 days to 6," he said. PolitiFact Ohio wondered how Budish came up with six days, given that the bill says 10 days. Specifically the House Bill 194 reads: "For all voters who are applying to vote absent voter’s ballots in person, ballots shall be printed and ready for use beginning on the tenth day before the day of the election." So how does Budish come up with 6 days? His chief of staff, Keary McCarthy, said pay close attention to the bill’s language. The bill goes on to say that in-person voting is prohibited on Sundays and must end the Friday before Election Day. Applying these restrictions to the 10 day-period, four days become off limits to voters: The first and last Sunday in the period and the Saturday and Monday immediately preceding Election Day. The Ohio Senate, also controlled by Republicans, passed Senate Bill 148 that also makes significant changes to the election laws and processes. It mirrors the House Bill in many ways but offers some differences, which will be worked out in coming days among Republican leaders representing both chambers. One of the differences between the two bills concerns in-person voting. The Senate’s version calls for in-person voting to begin 16 days before Election Day. But this window is also squeezed by prohibiting voting on Sundays and on the Saturday and Monday before Election Day. It also requires elections boards to close Saturday voting at noon. The House version allows for voting until 6 p.m. Applying these restrictions, the Senate bill takes away five days, leaving 11 days for in-person voting. Returning to the House bill and Budish’s assessment, his statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing. On the Truth-O-Meter, Politifact Ohio rates his claim True.

pomt-02216	Women are paid 77 cents for every $1 men get for the same work.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2014/apr/21/jason-carter/carters-pay-gap-claim-strays-track/	What about Jason? That was the question one of our Twitter followers had for us shortly after we rated former President Jimmy Carter’s claim that women make 23 percent less than men for doing the same work Mostly False. Hasn’t Carter’s grandson Jason, a state senator from DeKalb County and Democratic candidate for governor, been saying the same thing? "What will @PolitiFactGA say about @carter4governor repeating the same falsehood as his grandpappy?" asked the political website, Georgia Unfiltered. We decided to take a look. Many Democrats have complained about a gender pay gap in what some analysts say is an effort to increase support among women as the congressional elections take place this fall. On April 8, Jason Carter’s Twitter account had a message about the pay gap. "Women are paid 77¢ for every $1 men get for the same work. (Retweet) if you agree women should get equal pay for equal work," it said. Carter posted a similar message on his Facebook campaign page the same day. "Women are still paid 77 cents for every dollar that men make for doing the same work. That's not OK. Share if you agree we should have equal pay for equal work," it read. Some questioned Carter’s claim on his Twitter page, while others backed him up. So is candidate Carter correct? We believe, like his grandfather, part of his statements clouded the accuracy of his claim. The claims by Jason Carter and others stem from a U.S. Census Bureau survey released in 2011. The study found women’s total wages were about 23 percent lower than the total amount of men's wages. But that large discrepancy was due in part to the fact that men generally work more hours. The study did not attempt to look at equal pay for the same work or the same number of hours worked. Other data -- including hourly wages tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as well as data comparing the same jobs -- yield smaller wage gaps. The number does not take into account critical factors that could influence the figure, including specific occupation, time on the job and education level. And the gap drops dramatically if you compare men and women of similar education levels, job titles, time on the job and other relevant factors. Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis cited one survey, prepared for the Labor Department. It found that when such differences are accounted for, much of the hourly wage gap vanished. It shrinks to the low single digits. President Barack Obama, himself, made a verbal misstep on the campaign trail in 2012 when he said "women (are) paid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men." Our colleagues at PolitiFact in Washington rated that statement Mostly False for many of the same reasons we gave the same rating to the former president. Perhaps seeing the trouble with that statement, Obama said in his 2014 State of the Union address that women "make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns." That statement is more in line with the U.S. Census Bureau study because the president did not say that women were doing the same work and being underpaid. PolitiFact found other research that showed a smaller pay gap. PolitiFact rated Obama’s revised statement Mostly True. Bryan Thomas, a spokesman for Carter, told us via email that the candidate "believes it's wrong that women get paid less than men and is the candidate in this race who wants to do something to fix that problem." To sum up, Jason Carter said women were being paid 77 cents for every $1 men received for the same work. The widely cited U.S. Census Bureau study, though, did not attempt to look at equal pay for the same work or the same number of hours worked. Other federal data show smaller gaps when considering the specific occupation, time on the job and educational levels. Carter’s statements omit many of these factors. We rate it Mostly False.

Scott Walker are usually pretty plain, like the white chalk lines that meet at home plate. So, it was a surprise to see Walker’s May 10, 2016 release about the faculty at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, which arrived like a pitch thrown at a batter’s chin. Walker called a no-confidence vote being taken that day by the Milwaukee faculty a mere "fuss." The professors were expressing "their collective groan" about budgeting and "job-for-life tenure." The school "should not be about protecting the interests of the faculty, but about delivering value and excellence to Wisconsin." For a Walker news release, pretty vitriolic stuff. But in another way, the release was more typical, as it was filled with bullets of factual claims -- including this one, about the ratio of students to faculty at UW-Milwaukee: "At 2.8 students per faculty," the release declared, "average student enrollment per instructor is currently tied for second-lowest in its history since 1994." Fewer than three students for every faculty member? That would be a swing and a miss. No-confidence votes UW-Milwaukee’s total enrollment of 27,000 (22,000 undergraduates) makes it the second-largest school, behind UW-Madison (43,000 and 31,000), in the University of Wisconsin System. The system is overseen by members of the Board of Regents, nearly all of whom are appointed by the governor. Since Walker took office in 2011, the system campuses have received budget cuts and professors have seen tenure protections partially weakened. Those are key reasons for a series of no-confidence votes directed at the UW System, beginning with one approved by UW-Madison faculty eight days before the UW-Milwaukee vote. Walker’s pre-emptive statement was issued less than two hours before nearly 300 Milwaukee faculty members unanimously passed their no-confidence vote. That represented roughly 40 percent of the full-time faculty. Walker’s figure To back the 2.8 ratio claim, Walker’s office cited a UW System chart on "average individual instruction." The latest figure, for fall 2013, shows a ratio of 2.8 for UW-Milwaukee. But that is not a ratio of the total students per faculty member, as Walker says in the news release. It is a much narrower measure. As the chart itself explains, that is the ratio is for "individualized instruction, such as independent study or thesis research." Indeed, you would expect a ratio of 2.8 students per faculty member for such one-on-one-style instruction. But Milwaukee’s overall ratio is much different. The actual ratio Robin Van Harpen, UW-Milwaukee’s vice chancellor for finance and administrative affairs, gave us figures for fall 2015. Using full-time-equivalents, the school had 22,491 total students and 779 faculty (faculty being full, associate and assistant professors). That’s a student-to-faculty ratio of 29 to 1. Moreover, in 1994, the year Walker referenced in his news release, the ratio was actually lower: 21 to 1. And it has steadily trended upward since then. In other words, the ratio of students to faculty at UW-Milwaukee is growing, not shrinking. Two final points: Lecturers and adjunct instructors, who also teach, are not considered faculty. But if you include them in the count, the current ratio is 19 to 1 -- still far above what Walker claimed. The day after the Milwaukee vote, Walker’s office essentially corrected itself in a statement on a no-confidence vote at UW-Green Bay. The statement cited the same 2.8 statistic as it applied to Green Bay -- but added a line to make clear that the ratio referred only to individualized instruction. Our rating Charging that the ratio of students to faculty at UW-Milwaukee is shrinking, Walker said the school has "2.8 students per faculty" member, "tied for second-lowest in its history since 1994." But Walker cited the wrong statistic. In fact, UW-Milwaukee has 29 students for every professor, associate professor and assistant professor -- and that ratio has been growing, not shrinking, since 1994. For a statement that is false and ridiculous, our rating is Pants on Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9b0f3e97-bf70-4e81-9fcb-0e2efdd28a55	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2016-05-13T12:16:40	2016-05-10	['None']
pomt-11438	Say Sean Hannity said in 2008 that Obama’s willingness to meet with North Korea was "disturbing" while Trump’s "willingness to meet with North Korea is a huge foreign policy win."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/14/blog-posting/hannitys-double-standard-north-korea-trump-and-oba/	An image shared widely on Facebook and Reddit chides Fox News host Sean Hannity for having a double standard on presidents talking to North Korea. It says that in 2008 Hannity said that President Barack Obama’s "willingness to meet with North Korea is one of the most disturbing displays of Obama’s lack of foreign policy experience." But in 2018, Hannity said President Donald Trump’s "willingness to meet with North Korea is a huge foreign policy win." We hit the transcripts and video files. For the most part, those words accurately reflect what Hannity said. 2008 and Obama A week before Election Day 2008, Hannity gave 10 reasons not to vote for Obama. No. 2 on his list concerned talking to unfriendly regimes. "One of the most disturbing displays of Obama's lack of foreign policy expertise came during last year's YouTube debate," Hannity said Oct. 26, 2008. "The junior senator from Illinois gave what many called a naive answer for a question from the audience about whether he would meet with the leaders of Syria, Venezuela, Cuba or North Korea without preconditions." Asked during that debate if he would be willing to meet with those leaders without preconditions, Obama said "I would," and compared that to previous presidents. "Ronald Reagan and Democratic presidents like JFK constantly spoke to the Soviet Union at a time when Ronald Reagan called them an evil empire," Obama said. "And the reason is because they understood that we may not trust them and they may pose an extraordinary danger to this country, but we had the obligation to find areas where we can potentially move forward." The image mentioned only North Korea, while Hannity listed several countries. 2018 and Trump When news broke that Trump was open to meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Hannity voiced support. "A huge foreign policy win for President Trump," Hannity said March 8. "Little Rocket Man blinks. Now, the president’s tough rhetoric, his bold action, his severe sanctions, they appear to be working tonight. President Trump is accepting an invitation to meet with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un by May, and Pyongyang is agreeing to stop all nuclear and missile tests while these talks are underway. And the sanctions? They will continue." So the text in the image matches what Hannity said. But his criticism of Obama and his praise for Trump came in the context of different policies. Importance of preconditions Obama’s policy on North Korea grew more complicated over time. But initially, it was fairly simple, said Penn State international affairs professor Joseph DeThomas. Preconditions meant that in order for talks to happen, North Korea had to agree that the purpose was the complete denuclearization of North Korea. "During the campaign and early in his term Obama was very open to talks without preconditions," DeThomas said. For Trump, the picture is murkier. When Trump tweeted that he would meet with Kim Jong Un, North Korea had not taken any steps toward denuclearization. He said they had "talked" about it. "Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean representatives, not just a freeze," Trump wrote. "Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com But for North Korea, denuclearization applies to the entire peninsula, which has implications for the American presence and military posture in South Korea. That is not the same as simply agreeing to a North Korea without nukes. DeThomas said testing halts are customary during talks with North Korea. Beyond that, North Korea made no concessions or took any steps toward ending its nuclear program. Trump has imposed stricter sanctions and has been more ready to hint at using military force against North Korea. But in terms of having direct talks between the leaders of both nations, DeThomas said this administration set a lower bar than what previous presidents have demanded. "The Trump precondition for talks was that North Korea had to halt nuclear and missile testing for some unspecified period of time prior to commencement of talks," DeThomas said. " In February, Vice President Mike Pence drew headlines when he said sanctions and direct talks could happen at the same time. To some observers, that meant the administration was willing to talk without the precondition of North Korea agreeing to a future free of nukes. DeThomas characterized such words as "loosey goosey," but not indicative of a major change. In that regard, when Hannity praised Trump, the administration’s overall policy was tougher than what Obama had articulated when he ran for president. But the fact remains that Trump had agreed to a meeting before North Korea had taken any concrete steps toward ridding itself of nuclear weapons. Our ruling The side-by-side quotes cast Hannity as criticizing Obama for being willing to talk to North Korea while praising Trump for his willingness to do the same thing. The quotations are pretty much accurate. But the image glosses over the different policy preferences of each man at the time Hannity spoke. In 2008, Obama said simply there were no preconditions for a meeting with the leader. In 2018, Trump’s administration voiced some relaxation on preconditions, but not a full rejection of them. At the same time, Trump agreed to a meeting before North Korea had done more than agree to hold off on testing during any talks. The image leaves out some context, but overall, we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-01138	Since the United States began negotiations with Iran, "that's probably the first year and a half in which Iran has not advanced its nuclear program in the last decade."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/dec/21/barack-obama/obama-iran-has-not-advanced-nuclear-ambitions-us-n/	When you close out the year by ditching America’s 50-year isolation of Cuba, you can expect a few broader questions about your style on the international stage. President Barack Obama said in a year-end interview with CNN’s Candy Crowley that he has been "consistent in saying that where we can solve problems diplomatically, we should do so." Crowley pressed Obama to respond to the charge that he is too willing to cut deals that produce little in return for the United States. "The gist of it is that you're naive and they're rolling you," Crowley said, speaking of other world leaders. Obama shot back that on a couple of major fronts, his track record is looking pretty good. Russia now has a crisis on its hands as its economy stalls and the value of the ruble tumbles. On Iran, the president said there have been real gains. "Over the last year and a half, since we began negotiations with them, that's probably the first year and a half in which Iran has not advanced its nuclear program in the last decade," Obama said. The fear that Iran is developing nuclear weapons, a charge that Iran denies, has bedeviled the international community for over 15 years. We decided to take a closer look at whether Iran’s program has advanced or not. We found general agreement that in terms of curtailing the means to produce enriched uranium and plutonium, the essential fuels needed for an atomic bomb, negotiations between the United States, Iran and other United Nations countries contributed to real progress. However, some analysts define Iran’s nuclear program more broadly to include suspected efforts to design nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. The negotiations don’t address those elements, however, and what Iran is doing or has done in that area is subject to much debate. By way of refresher, in November 2013, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, plus Germany, and Iran signed an agreement that temporarily stopped or rolled back Iran’s production of potentially weapons grade nuclear material. In November 2014, that agreement was extended by four months, with some additional restrictions on Iran. In exchange, Iran has been able to sell more of its oil and gain access to millions of dollars that had been frozen in overseas bank accounts. The key elements in the agreements Negotiators focused on nuclear fuel. This had three main aspects. Stopping the production and accumulation of uranium enriched to the 20 percent level of the isotope U-235 and converting a large fraction of what it had to a form harder to use in a weapon. Stop the installation of additional centrifuge machines at Iran’s two enrichment facilities. Centrifuges are essential to the enrichment process. Put the brakes on construction of Iran’s heavy water reactor in Arak. If it were operational, this reactor could produce enough plutonium in its spent fuel for one to two nuclear warheads. Importantly, Iran agreed to inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. That agency has found that Iran complied with the terms of the original November 2013 agreement. In its November 2014 report, the agency said, "All of the enrichment related activities at Iran’s declared facilities are under Agency safeguards, and all of the nuclear material, installed cascades, and feed and withdrawal stations at those facilities are subject to Agency containment and surveillance." To be clear, Iran continues to enrich uranium, but only to the level of 5 percent of U-235, a form that falls well short of the needs of weapon makers. Regarding heavy water facilities, the IAEA said that Iran had not stopped all work across all of its heavy water projects, but it had not installed any major components. What the experts say As far as nuclear material is concerned, the experts we reached said the agreements successfully, though perhaps only temporarily, curtailed production. "When President Obama says that for the first time in the past decade Iran has not advanced its nuclear program he is correct," said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, a research group that advocates for arms control policies. "Leading up to the interim deal, Iran had nearly amassed enough 20 percent enriched uranium gas, which when further enriched to weapons grade is enough for one bomb." That material is no longer available, Kimball said. Matthew Bunn, a principal investigator with the Project on Managing the Atom at Harvard University’s Kennedy School, also said Obama basically has it right on Iran. "They don’t have any more equipment in place for producing bomb material than they had a year and a half ago," Bunn said. David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, a Washington-based group that aims to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, offered a more qualified view. Albright called progress on enrichment, centrifuges and the heavy water facilities in Arak, a "great accomplishment." But Albright noted that, "Iran continues to run almost 10,000 centrifuges, enriching and stockpiling 3.5 percent low enriched uranium." And Iran’s research on advanced centrifuges, with limits, is ongoing. Albright is also concerned that Iran has so far not allowed the international inspectors the access they need to learn more about any nuclear weapons research Iran had in the past. Matthew Kroenig, a professor of international relations at Georgetown University, also focused on the weapons side of the equation. Kroenig noted that the agreements that limited and rolled back the production of nuclear-grade material were silent on this front. "Iran's missile production continues, and we are uncertain about the nuclear weapons design work, although many experts believe that continues as well," Kroenig said. But Kroenig also described curtailing the production of nuclear fuel as the "most important" piece of the nonproliferation effort with Iran. Two notes on the time elements mentioned in Obama’s comments. He said this is the first time in a decade that Iran’s nuclear program did not advance. Iran restarted its uranium enrichment program in 2005. That would mean it has been a bit over nine years. Also, the president’s year and a half is a bit of a stretch. The first agreement with Iran was signed barely over a year ago, although the terms were announced earlier. Our ruling Obama said that we have seen "probably the first year and a half in which Iran has not advanced its nuclear program in the last decade." The agreement signed in November 2013 has made it harder for Iran to produce weapons-grade nuclear material. International observers report that Iran complied with the terms of the temporary agreement. The amount of enriched uranium is less, and the country’s facilities to produce weapons-grade material has been curtailed. But that does not mean the country has completely stopped all activities that could produce nuclear weapons material in the future. There is also concern about broader aspects of a nuclear weapons program, such as weapons design and missile development. We rate Obama’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-07587	Central Health "is the only hospital district in Texas that spends taxpayer dollars on abortions."	true	/texas/statements/2011/mar/26/wayne-christian/state-rep-wayne-christian-says-central-health-trav/	State Rep. Wayne Christian is behind legislation prohibiting hospital districts from using tax dollars to fund abortions, but the ban would affect just one hospital district statewide, according to the Republican from Center. "Currently the Travis County Healthcare District, known as Central Health, is the only hospital district in Texas that spends taxpayer dollars on abortions," he said in a March 15 press release. The only one? Responding to our query for more information, Jon McClellan, Christian’s chief of staff, passed on an e-mail from Joe Pojman, executive director of Texas Alliance for Life. "We know of no other hospital district that pays for elective abortions (abortions for reasons other than to save the mother’s life)," Pojman said. "To our knowledge, the only other hospital district that funded elective abortions was in Tarrant County, and they changed their policy to not fund elective abortions approximately 20 years ago." Pojman told us that he based his conclusion on news stories and websites for hospital districts in several counties, including Harris, Dallas, Tarrant, Bexar and Nueces. "None list abortion as a service provided," he said. "We also inquired with individuals in several other counties knowledgeable about their local hospital districts. All believe their local hospital districts do not fund abortions." Next, we contacted the Travis County hospital district, which was created in 2004 following a countywide vote. Central Health operates the Medical Assistance Program, which Austin created in the 1970s to provide low-income residents with subsidized health care services. According to its website, Central Health arranges health care services for Travis County residents who aren’t eligible for other insurance programs. Residents at or below the federal poverty line can qualify for full benefits, according to the site. Spokeswoman Christie Garbe told us that she couldn’t speak for other districts but said Central Health uses tax dollars to fund abortions. "Austin and Travis County has a long history of funding reproductive health services for women — the full range of health services," she said. The Central Health board voted unanimously in December 2009 to renew a $450,000, five-year contract with agencies to provide pregnancy termination services and counseling, according to a September 2010 Austin American-Statesman news article. Abortion funding accounts for less than half of 1 percent of Central Health’s $102.6 million budget for fiscal year 2011, Garbe said. About 60 percent of Central Health’s budget is funded from property taxes, Garbe said. The rest is funded by other revenue, including money from tobacco settlements and leasing income from hospitals the district owns, such as University Medical Center Brackenridge. Next, we tried to gauge whether other hospital districts put tax dollars toward abortions. Christine Mann, a spokeswoman at the Texas Department of State Health Services, told us the agency doesn’t track hospital district funding sources. But Mann pointed out that some facilities may provide abortions to women who are insured through Medicaid. Stephanie Goodman, a spokeswoman with the Texas Department of Health and Human Services, told us that in 2010, the Texas Medicaid program paid for one abortion in Brownsville. "In that case, the mother’s life was in danger," she said. Texas follows the federal standard imposed by the Hyde Amendment in 1976, which allows Medicaid funding for abortion only in cases of rape, incest and life endangerment. Goodman couldn’t tell us in what facility the Brownsville abortion took place because the agency tracks such Medicaid payments through individual medical claims — private information it can’t release, she said. Next, short of calling every hospital district statewide — Texas Hospital Association spokeswoman Amanda Engler said there are about 180 — we asked several in Texas’ larger cities whether they fund abortions with tax dollars. Candace White, a spokeswoman with Parkland Health and Hospital System in Dallas, told us that while Parkland funds reproductive services with some tax money, abortions aren’t included. Melinda Muse, a spokeswoman with tax-supported Harris County Hospital District in Houston, likewise said the nonprofit doesn’t subsidize abortions. Martha Althoff-Olivas, a spokeswoman with the University Medical Center of El Paso, told us the district doesn’t perform abortions unless the mother’s life is in danger. If the woman was insured through Medicaid, she assumed the procedure would be covered, she said. Both Diana Carroll, a spokeswoman with JPS Health Network in Fort Worth, and Leni Kirkman, a spokeswoman with University Health System in San Antonio, told us their districts don’t offer abortion services at all. Vicki Saporta, president of the National Abortion Federation, which represents abortion providers, said: "To our knowledge, no other hospital district in Texas provides coverage for medically-necessary abortion care for low-income women. However, federal Medicaid funds cover abortions in cases of rape, incest or life endangerment at Texas hospitals that are enrolled in Medicaid providers." A December 2009 Statesman news article also says Central Health "is now the only government entity in Texas that uses public money for abortions." Another December 2009 Statesman news article quotes Megan Peterson, director of advocacy for the Boston-based National Network of Abortion Funds, saying: "This idea of the city setting aside money to help pay for this is definitely unique to Austin." Admittedly, we haven’t checked every hospital district in the state, but we’ve found no information contrary to Christian’s statement. We rate this statement as True.

pomt-07043	Ethanol reduced gas prices by 89 cents per gallon in 2010, and if ethanol disappeared, gas prices could rise by as much as 92 percent.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/01/renewable-fuels-association/industry-warns-gas-prices-would-rise-89-cents-with/	We recently noticed an advertisement in the Washington, D.C. Metro system that made a striking claim about ethanol -- an alcohol made from fermented corn that is added to gasoline, usually comprising 10 percent of a gallon. First, some background to help explain the context of the ad. Supporters and critics of ethanol have battled for years over the wisdom of continuing longstanding ethanol subsidies. Currently, the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit, or VEETC, offers a credit $0.45 for every gallon of ethanol blended with gasoline. The credit had been scheduled to expire at the end of 2010, but Congress extended it for another year. On June 16, 2011, the U.S. Senate approved legislation to end the VEETC subsidy, as well as end a separate, 54-cent-per-gallon tariff on imported ethanol. While the Senate measure is not expected to become law, it re-energized the debate over ethanol subsidies. With the law’s looming sunset at the end of 2011, the debate is likely to continue for at least the rest of this year. Those who favor rolling back ethanol subsidies argue that a roughly $6 billion subsidy is unsustainable given today’s rising national debt. However, the ethanol industry, represented by a group called the Renewable Fuels Association, has made an aggressive counterattack, arguing that ethanol is vital to keeping a lid on gasoline prices -- potentially a potent issue for Americans as gasoline hovers between $3 and $4 per gallon. The trade group's Metro station advertisement mirrors other information available on the group’s website. It says, "Ethanol reduced gas prices by 89 cents per gallon in 2010. Ethanol reduced the average American’s household gasoline bill by more than $800. If ethanol disappeared, gas prices could rise by as much as 92 percent." We checked these figures first with the Renewable Fuels Association, and then with outside experts. The RFA cited a study by two economists -- Xiaodong Du from the University of Wisconsin and Dermot J. Hayes of Iowa State University -- published in April 2011. Using mathematical modeling, the study concluded that in 2010, the presence of ethanol reduced gasoline prices by 89 cents per gallon. Meanwhile, the study said, if ethanol production came to an immediate halt, the estimated gasoline price increase would range from 41 percent to 92 percent. Meanwhile, the trade group extrapolated from the paper’s findings to produce the claim that "ethanol reduced the average American’s household gasoline bill by more than $800." "In 2010 alone, ethanol reduced the average American household’s gasoline bill by more than $800," RFA said in a news release, citing data from the Federal Highway Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Energy Department showing that the average American household consumed 900 gallons of gasoline at an average price of $2.74 per gallon in 2010. The group calculated that the average family’s annual gasoline bill was $2,470, an amount that would have been closer to $3,270 without ethanol. So RFA can point to a study by two university economists to back up its numbers. But what is the group leaving out? We’ll point out a few concerns. The study’s funding. In the paper, the authors acknowledged the Renewable Fuel Association "for their financial support." This doesn’t mean the study is right or wrong, but it does mean that the RFA is quoting research it helped support financially, so the findings deserve independent scrutiny. Choice of time period. The paper cited the 89 cent figure for 2010, but it also offered a longer-term calculation that’s less eye-popping, since it’s not based on a short period in which gasoline prices happened to be unusually high. Specifically, between January 2000 to December 2010, the authors found, ethanol reduced gasoline prices by 25 cents per gallon nationally. That’s still a notable amount -- and the ad’s wording accurately described the figure they were using -- but 25 cents per gallon is less than one-third the amount it was in 2010. This means that RFA was highlighting a time period that made the claim more striking. The paper poses an unrealistic scenario. The Senate bill would not have touched other federal laws that encourage ethanol production, including a "renewable fuel standard" initiated in 2005 that requires transportation fuel to contain a certain amount of renewable fuel blended with gasoline. So the standard by which the RFA-backed paper made its assumptions -- that "ethanol production came to an immediate halt" -- is not plausible in the real world. "This is a fantasy study dreamed up to answer a question that no one has asked: What would happen if ethanol disappeared?" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that has been critical of ethanol subsidies. "We are not arguing that ethanol should cease to exist, just that it make its way in the marketplace. Studies have clearly shown that absent subsidies like the tax credit and the mandate, there would be ethanol production. So it is irrelevant." To back up his claim that legislation now under consideration wouldn’t kill off the ethanol industry, Ellis pointed to research by Bruce A. Babcock, director of the Center for Agricultural and Rural Development at Iowa State University. Babcock cited a study he co-wrote with an Iowa State colleague, Jacinto F. Fabiosa. They found that between 2005 and 2009, margins in the ethanol industry were wide enough that "a large expansion in U.S. corn ethanol production would have occurred even if the subsidies and mandates had not been in place. The reason is that the return on investment in ethanol would have been so high that investors still would have brought their capital to the industry." The ad focuses on short-term impacts and ignores long-term impacts. Babcock said a big part of why ethanol production has kept gasoline prices low is that it has kept U.S. oil refineries, and to some extent world refineries, from having to operate at full capacity. That matters because when refineries operate at full capacity, they are able to charge higher prices. And if demand rises high enough, they’d have to pay to build new refinery capacity. But while Babcock says this "is a credible short-term and medium-term argument, over the longer term," oil companies would adjust their capacity so that "over time, the impact of ethanol on gas prices should shrink." Similarly, while the trade association is almost certainly correct that a price shock would result from a sudden disappearance of ethanol -- which, as we said, is a highly unlikely scenario -- the experts we spoke to said that a new equilibrium would eventually be reached, and that equilibrium would likely produce cost increases well below the immediate, price-shock figures cited in the trade group’s ad. RFA ignores other negative impacts of the subsidies in the economy. For starters, there is evidence that subsidies for corn used in ethanol have raised corn prices and, in turn, hiked prices for agricultural sectors that rely on corn for feed, such as beef production. While estimates of the impact have varied, the Congressional Budget Office estimated in a 2009 study that "the increased use of ethanol accounted for about 10 percent to 15 percent of the rise in food prices between April 2007 and April 2008. In turn, that increase will boost federal spending for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly the Food Stamp program) and child nutrition programs by an estimated $600 million to $900 million in fiscal year 2009." In addition, RFA’s ad doesn’t account for "all the coal, natural gas, diesel fuel, soil, ground water, etc., that were used up to produce ethanol," said Tad Patzek, an engineering professor at the University of Texas. "These valuable raw materials could have been used differently to produce more electricity, more food, lessen soil erosion (and) limit ground- and surface water contamination. All of these activities would be beneficial for the country, far outweighing a marginal and temporary increase of gasoline’s cost if ethanol subsidies were withdrawn suddenly, and its production collapsed." Finally, the ad doesn’t factor in roughly $6 billion direct hit to the Treasury (and, indirectly, to American taxpayers) from the subsidies, even though any comprehensive balance-sheet anaysis would include that. When we presented the gist of our analysis to the Renewable Fuels Association, the group made several points. Officials said they used the 2010 figures because they’re most relevant to current price conditions. They said that using their model, even a 25-cent increase in gasoline prices would amount to $34.5 billion per year in added costs for gasoline -- "far outweighing" the annual cost of VEETC. The group also argued that it’s unfair to include factors outside of the scope of a brief advertisement that focuses squarely on gasoline prices. "The ad focuses on gas prices," said Geoff Cooper, vice president of research and analysis with the Renewable Fuels Association. "Not food prices. Not corn prices. Not the cost of VEETC. Not lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions and energy use. We are more than willing to engage in a thoughtful discussion on those issues, but they are outside the scope of the paper on which the ad is based." If you include other factors beyond gasoline prices, fairness "would require you" to note that "the production and use of 13 billion gallons of ethanol last year helped create more than 400,000 jobs across the economy from agriculture to manufacturing to the service sector. Nearly 70,400 American are directly involved in the production of ethanol," said Christina Martin, executive vice president of the Renewable Fuels Association. Ethanol production adds nearly $54 billion to the nation’s gross domestic product, she said. Finally, on the issue of whether the immediate end to ethanol is realistic, Cooper said that "there have been recent calls to repeal the renewable fuel standard, kill the tax credit, and essentially undo all of the entire industry’s policy foundation. So, it is not entirely ‘unrealistic’ to envision a scenario in which ethanol production is significantly curtailed." Still, we’re not convinced. While the Senate bill would have ended certain subsidies, it would not have banned production outright, and even the changes proposed in the Senate bill would not have touched the renewable fuel standard, which aids the ethanol industry and ensures its partial or even complete survival. Even if more sweeping changes than those in the Senate bill were imposed, independent experts tell us that the likelihood of the industry’s sudden collapse would be remote. So while changing or eliminating the law on ethanol subsidies might have an impact on prices at the pump, it’s highly unlikely that the industry would cease to exist -- so the immediate impact on gasoline prices would be less than 89 cents, and even lower as markets adjust in the longer term.

pomt-01045	Online voter registration is a "more secure" way of doing voter registration.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/jan/23/jeff-clemens/online-voter-registration-more-secure-florida-stat/	Florida lawmakers have overhauled many aspects of our elections laws in recent years, but one aspect has remained untouched: Voters can’t register online. The statewide association of elections supervisors, which represents officials in both major parties, wants lawmakers to change that during the upcoming session. Supporters of the legislation argue one of the benefits is that it’s more secure. "This is actually just simply a more secure, accurate and cost-efficient way of doing voter registration," said Sen. Jeff Clemens, D-Lake Worth, said at a Senate Ethics and Elections committee hearing Jan. 20. Clemens is sponsoring a bill for the upcoming session. Pasco Supervisor of Elections Brian Corley, a Republican in favor of online registration, made similar remarks at the hearing. Citing information from a former elections official in Arizona -- the first state to use online registration -- Corley said that "there is a reduction in fraud." Is online registration more secure? We decided to check it out. The current system Today, Florida voters fill out a paper form and submit it to a county elections official, or an entity such as a third-party group can submit it for them. Additionally, under the National Voting Rights Act (also known as "Motor Voter"), a person can verbally relay their voter registration information while applying for a driver’s license. Traditional paper registration opens up the window for fraud or errors in multiple ways, according to Tammy Patrick, an elections expert at the Bipartisan Policy Center and former elections official in Maricopa County, Ariz. Some voters hand over personal information to strangers who sign up voters, and it may sit around somewhere until submitted several days or weeks later. Then elections officials have to decipher the forms and input the information. (In Florida, third parties must submit forms within 10 days.) With online registration, the exchange and verification of information happens immediately. Clemens’ bill would allow applicants to submit their voter registration applications online, and the state would compare the information with driver’s license records. Floridians could still choose to register to vote by paper. Many advocates of online voter registration say that it saves money, reduces the opportunity for errors from data entry or illegible handwriting and has been successfully used in both blue and red states. We’ll dive more into the security issues below. At least 20 states currently offer online voter registration for new applicants and a few more are in the works. The Presidential Commission on Election Administration, co-chaired by lawyers for the campaigns of Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, recommended online registration in their 2014 report. A research report from the Pew Charitable Trusts concluded that online registration systems "reduce the potential for fraud while improving the accuracy of voter rolls. All states have security procedures and protocols in place, including data encryption and tracking, while limiting those who have access to their system internally. No state has reported a security breach, including Arizona, where voters have been registering online for more than a decade." How much fraud has occurred nationwide in terms of paper registration? That is difficult to quantify because it depends on how someone defines "fraud." Some fraudulent applications are rejected by elections officials (for example, Mickey Mouse), while others might get registered but then not vote. In 2008, ACORN in Florida turned over to law enforcement hundreds of registration applications collected by some of their workers that they deemed suspicious -- including one for the deceased actor Paul Newman. But those forms were never filed with elections officials, and ACORN, a liberal group, later disbanded amid nationwide problems. In 2012, the Republican Party of Florida fired vendor Strategic Allied Consulting amid reports of fraudulent registration forms. Wendy Underhill, an elections expert at the National Conference of State Legislatures, says comparing security in online and paper systems is like comparing apples and oranges. "When people talk about security for online voter registration systems, they’re thinking of hacking and cyber security breaches," she said. "When people talk about security for paper-based registration, the questions are whether the registration application is transmitted to the elections people or never quite makes it there, and whether data from the forms is taken by the groups doing registration drives, and is that secure." Cybersecurity experts have raised some concerns about a couple of state systems, including Maryland. In 2012, cybersecurity experts wrote to Maryland officials suggesting they take steps to better protect the online system. The driver’s license number is based on a formula involving the voter’s name and date of birth -- so the experts said that if someone had that information, they could alter the registration. (Security experts raised similar concerns about the system in Washington state.) No security breach actually occurred, said Nikki Charlson, Maryland’s deputy state administration for the elections board. However, in response, the state now requires that applicants provide additional information, including their Social Security number and date that their driver’s license was issued. (Washington election officials told us they didn’t have a breach either but have since made changes.) Loyola Law school professor Justin Levitt, an expert on election administration, told PolitiFact Florida that it is difficult to make direct quantifiable comparisons between online and paper systems. "In my rough sense of the comparative frequency and magnitude of the risks, I'd agree with the Florida state senator that online registration ends up more secure, accurate, and cost-efficient, as he says," Levitt said. "But I doubt you'll find anyone who's got a reliable study directly comparing the security of the two different methods, just because the precise rate of security breaches is so difficult to assess. (Indeed, it's more difficult to assess in the offline system than the online one.) It's certainly true that the most publicized significant breaches in the past have been with the offline system -- but that's the system states have been deploying for a whole lot longer." Hans Von Spakovsky, an elections expert who works for the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that online registration for individuals for whom the state already has a record, such as driver’s license information, is not a problem. That’s the method recommended by the presidential commission. "You will find that the states that have implemented online registration have almost all limited it to registration for individuals for whom there is already an existing state record that has been verified and where there is an existing signature," he said. The National Republican Lawyers Association is among the groups that support online voter registration. "When designed and implemented properly, online registration can be a more secure, accurate and cost-efficient way of doing voter registration," said Michael B. Thielen, the executive director. Our ruling Clemens said that online voter registration is a "a more secure" way of doing voter registration. Experts who study online registration say there have been no reports of actual security breaches or fraud. If designed in a way to account for security, online registration reduces opportunities for fraud and errors. However, experts warned that both online and paper systems can have potential pitfalls -- the question is how do elections officials protect each system. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-01420	"The only candidate pocketing big money from people who want to destroy coal is Mitch McConnell."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/08/alison-lundergan-grimes/alison-lundergan-grimes-says-mitch-mcconnell-not-s/	Not everyone agrees there’s a war on coal, as Republicans often charge, but there’s no question there’s a war over the war on coal in Kentucky’s high-profile Senate race. For months, Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell have lobbed accusations at each other, saying their opponent is too weak in supporting the state’s abundant fossil fuel. The latest salvo comes from Grimes, who has sustained accusations by McConnell that she wouldn’t fight back against the Environmental Protection Agency’s new proposal for regulating carbon emissions. In a recent ad — which begins with her "approving" the ad while appearing in a mine, helmet and all — she parries McConnell’s claim by launching her own coal-themed attack. "What Mitch McConnell doesn’t want you to know is that he and his wife personally took $600,000 from anti-coal groups, including New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s anti-coal foundation," Grimes said. "The only candidate pocketing big money from people who want to destroy coal is Mitch McConnell." We’ll assess two parts of this claim. First, is McConnell "pocketing big money from people who want to destroy coal"? And second, is he the "only candidate" taking money from anti-coal activists? McConnell’s money When we asked Grimes for evidence that McConnell has received $600,000 from those who oppose coal, a Grimes spokeswoman said that McConnell’s wife, former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, sits on the board of directors of Bloomberg Philanthropies, a charitable organization founded by the former New York City mayor and billionaire founder of the Bloomberg media conglomerate. In 2011, Bloomberg Philanthropies promised $50 million over four years to the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Initiative. The recipient had a decidedly anti-coal agenda, including an effort to close coal plants in many parts of the country. According to Yahoo! News, Bloomberg said, "Ending coal power production is the right thing to do, because while it may seem to be an inexpensive energy source the impact on our environment and the impact on public health is significant." However, Chao didn’t join the board until 2012. Bloomberg Philanthropies spokeswoman Meghan Womack told PolitiFact, "The decision to provide funding to Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal initiative took place before Elaine Chao joined the Bloomberg Philanthropies board. Bloomberg Philanthropies’ board members do not vote on individual initiatives or program spends." But the claim really goes off the rails when the ad says McConnell and Chao took $600,000 from anti-coal groups. Chao made far less than that — $9,400 — for serving on the board of Bloomberg Philanthropies, according to the organization’s latest annual filing in 2012. So how does the Grimes campaign get to $600,000? They also count the $684,186 in fees, stock options and other compensation that Chao made while serving on the board of directors for Wells Fargo. How can a bank be anti-coal? According to Yahoo! News, in 2013, Wells Fargo announced it would stop investing in companies that engage in mountaintop removal, a practice that involves extracting coal more or less by blowing up mountain summits. "We recognize the significant concerns associated with this practice and we also acknowledge the significant investments made by our coal customers in their mine operations, which were entered into in good faith and in accordance with applicable regulations," Wells Fargo wrote in a report titled Environmental and Social Risk Management. "As a result of our deliberate approach and the broader movement of the industry toward other mining methods, our involvement with the practice of (mountaintop removal) is limited and declining. Wells Fargo will not extend credit to individual MTR mining projects or to a coal producer that receives a majority of its production from MTR mining." That’s not an insignificant development, but as the Washington Post Fact Checker noted in its own analysis of the ad, that only tells part of the story. For instance, Wells Fargo told the Washington Post, "Given that we still finance coal companies, we would certainly not characterize ourselves as ‘anti-coal.’ " Environmental groups, too, don’t agree that Wells Fargo is out to destroy coal. On the contrary, in 2012, Rainforest Action Network, Sierra Club, and BankTrack named Wells Fargo one of the top five worst banks on coal due to "their relationship to and control over these dirty dinosaurs." An updated report card from the groups released in 2014 gave Wells Fargo a "B" for its mountain-top removal investments, but the bank still scored a "D" for its ties to coal-fired power plants. There are certainly banks with a cozier relationship with coal and energy companies. But even though Wells Fargo says it does "not finance coal-power plants on a stand-alone basis," Wells Fargo remains a bank that "provided $1.9 billion in financing as a lead arranger or lead manager in transactions with coal-fired power companies," according to the environmental report. Grimes’ money How about the other side of the equation — that McConnell is the only candidate "pocketing big money" from anti-coal groups? As it happens, Grimes’ campaign has benefited some from groups and individuals that are critical of coal use. For starters, her campaign reported a $1,000 donation from Frances Beinecke, the president of the Natural Resource Defense Council. The NRDC was instrumental in helping the Obama administration develop the new carbon regulations on existing power plants. In October 2011, Susie Tompkins Buell, the founder of the women’s clothing line Esprit and a noted climate change activist, held a fundraiser for Grimes at her California home. Grimes’ campaign points out the McConnell has also accepted money from some donors with anti-coal ties. For example, McConnell received $2,000 in campaign contributions from David Litman, a Texas businessman who started Texas Business for Clean Air to oppose new coal plants there. Meanwhile, Grimes’ campaign has also benefited indirectly from outside groups that have helped in the ongoing ad wars in Kentucky without officially coordinating with her campaign. CREDO, a progressive organization with a campaign focused on fighting "dirty coal," has spent $35,000 to air anti-McConnell ads so far, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign finance watchdog. Meanwhile, the Senate Majority PAC, a political arm of Senate Democrats, has put $4.3 million into the race. The PAC has received significant funding — about $5 million so far — from billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer. That’s not to say that Grimes’ campaign is bankrolled or heavily influenced by anti-coal organizations. Indeed, environmental groups have not jumped into the Kentucky Senate race to back Grimes with the same intensity as they have to help Democrats in states like Colorado and Michigan. But there’s enough financial support from anti-coal entities that Grimes’ claim of entirely clean hands is significantly misleading. Our ruling A Grimes ad claimed that "the only candidate pocketing big money from people who want to destroy coal is Mitch McConnell." The assertion is that McConnell and his wife took $600,000 from anti-coal organizations. But the overwhelming bulk of that was earned by Chao from sitting on the board of directors for Wells Fargo, a bank that, despite some steps to curb its support of mountain-top removal mining, still maintains $1.8 billion in coal investments, environmental groups say. Meanwhile, Grimes’ campaign has directly and indirectly benefited from money and ads from environmental groups and activists critical of coal. We rate the claim False.

pomt-07359	Benzene has "never been proven to be harmful."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2011/may/07/rick-hardcastle/state-rep-rick-hardcastle-says-benzene-has-never-b/	During House debate, state Rep. Rick Hardcastle brushed off a colleague’s concerns about benzene emissions near Texas schools. "Are you aware benzene is also a compound in soap?" Hardcastle said April 28. "Found at every car wash in this state — and several other industries in this state? And it’s never been proven to be harmful." The Vernon Republican was opposing an amendment by Rep. Lon Burnam, D-Fort Worth, that would prohibit the Oil and Gas Commission from issuing drilling permits for gas wells within 1,200 feet from a public school unless they meet a set of conditions, including installing emission controls and ensuring certain pollutants, such as benzene, fall below certain concentrations. Members tabled Burnam’s proposal. Still, we wondered if benzene has really never been proven harmful? First, a benzene primer: According to the federal Environmental Protection Agency, benzene is an organic chemical compound found most often in the air as a result of emissions from burning coal and oil, drilling for natural gas or in gasoline vapors, car exhaust, cigarette smoke and other sources. The chemical also is used as a solvent for inks, paint and plastics and to manufacture detergents. EPA spokesman Joe Hubbard told us benzene is a "widely used chemical formed from both natural processes and human activities." Still, in 1986, the agency classified benzene as a "human carcinogen and hazardous air pollutant," he said. When we reached Hardcastle, he agreed that benzene is "a proven carcinogen" but said that’s only so when a person is "overly-exposed to it" for a long period of time. Otherwise, he said, it hasn’t been proven harmful. "It’s a carcinogen, but everything’s a carcinogen," he said. "You eat too much white bread and it’s a carcinogen." Texas Commission on Environmental Quality spokesman Terry Clawson told us that benzene is harmful depending on its concentration in air and how long someone is exposed to it. "Typical outdoor concentrations" of benzene, less than one part per billion, are "much lower than concentrations that have been shown to cause harmful effects in people," he said. But exposure to higher concentrations, tens of thousands of parts per billion, over a period of many months to years "has been shown to cause harmful effects on blood," he said. Longer exposures, over many years, have "been shown to cause leukemia in workers," he said. A fact sheet issued by the agency in October 2007 says as much: "Permitted levels of benzene should not cause adverse health and welfare effects," but breathing high levels of the chemical compound can damage blood cells, human studies indicate. "Some occupational workers, who have been exposed to some of the highest air concentrations of benzene for years, experienced a decrease in the number of white blood cells circulating in their blood." According to the EPA’s web page on hazards associated with benzene, chronic exposure for a year or more has caused blood disorders, including reduced numbers of red blood cells and aplastic anemia — a risk factor for developing acute non-lymphocytic leukemia. The EPA site says short-term exposure to benzene may cause drowsiness, dizziness, headaches, eye, skin and respiratory tract irritation, and, at high levels, unconsciousness. And a February 2009 study funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences found that leukemia risks could be greater at ambient levels of benzene exposure — that is, benzene in the air where people live, rather than where they work — than previously thought. A 2009 EPA summary says that some studies, such as those gauging links between childhood exposure to benzene and childhood cancer, are equivocal. A 2001 study found a connection between Hodgkins lymphoma and young children who lived in high-traffic ares with higher concentrations of benzene during pregnancy or early childhood, while a 2002 study found no connection between childhood cancer rates and benzene concentrations in high-traffic neighborhoods. Closer to home, a 2010 study by researchers at the University of Texas and the Texas Department of State Health Services found that women living in Texas neighborhoods with high levels of benzene (more than 3 micrograms per cubic meter of air) were more likely to bear children with spinal bifida — a serious birth defect that can cause paralysis and neurological disorders. According to an August 2007 benzene fact sheet published by the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, "some women who breathed high levels of benzene for many months had irregular menstrual periods and a decrease in the size of their ovaries." But, according to the fact sheet, "we do not know for certain that benzene caused these effects." Recent studies have found that environmental exposure to benzene increases the risk of childhood cancer, birth defects and lowers birth weight, he said. "Cancer is not the only concern. "While it’s true that the only ‘proven’ effects are in occupationally exposed workers, studies strongly suggest that adverse effects on children and pregnant women are probably at lower environmental levels. Finally, Martyn Smith, a toxicology professor at the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley, who has studied the health effects of benzene, told us that Hardcastle is "wrong." There is no known threshold for when benzene becomes carcinogenic, Smith said. According to a study Smith authored that was published in the Annual Review of Public Health in April 2010, "there is probably no safe level of exposure of benzene, and all exposures constitute some risk." Where does that leave us? It’s true that benzene is a common air pollutant and is found in everyday products such as detergents. But to claim that airborne benzene has not been proven harmful flies in the face of scientific evidence that long-term exposure in the workplace can cause cancer and other negative health effects — not to mention studies suggesting lower levels of environmental exposure may also be unsafe.

pomt-09430	“Bill White ...offered sanctuary to illegal immigrants.”	false	/texas/statements/2010/mar/14/cathie-adams/gop-chair-cathie-adams-says-bill-white-gave-sanctu/	Republicans had former Houston Mayor Bill White in their sights well before he won the Democratic nod for governor this month. In February, Cathie Adams, who chairs the Republican Party of Texas, distributed a fund-raising letter calling White an extreme liberal with the kind of record only a Chicago politician — like President Barack Obama — could admire. Her letter levels six charges. For this ruling , we're zeroing in on the one that gave us the biggest workout (and we address her other statements in separate Truth-O-Meter items.) Adams wrote: “Bill White ... offered sanctuary to illegal immigrants." Who knew? We wanted to learn more. To back up Adams, the Republican Party pointed us to a report updated by the Congressional Research Service in 2006 that lists Houston among 32 localities -- Austin and Katy were the other two in Texas -- with sanctuary policies. White was about midway through his six years as mayor when the report came out. Broadly, the report states, so-called sanctuary cities “have their roots in the 1980s religious sanctuary movement by American churches. These churches provided sanctuary to thousands of unauthorized Central American migrants fleeing civil war in their homelands. Most cities that are considered sanctuary cities have adopted a ‘don’t ask-don’t tell’ policy where they don’t require their employees, including law enforcement officers, to report to federal officials aliens who may be illegally present in the country.” The report continues: “Localities, and in some cases individual police departments, in such areas that are considered ‘sanctuary cities,’ have utilized various mechanisms to ensure that unauthorized aliens who may be present in their jurisdiction illegally are not turned in to federal authorities.” The report doesn't state why each locality made the list. Houston's officialdom, including White and Police Chief Harold Hurtt, disputed the characterization, noting there's no city ordinance designating Houston a sanctuary. A 2007 U.S. Department of Justice report (brought to our attention by White's campaign) said its researchers found only two jurisdictions receiving at least $1 million a year in federal aid to incarcerate "criminal aliens" had official sanctuary policies posted online--California's city and county of San Francisco and the state of Oregon. Harris County, home to Houston, was getting more than $2 million in annual aid at the time; presumably, it was included in the DOJ review. In short, Houston has no official sanctuary policy. Still, such a city may have other policies that "interfere or shield people from detection" by U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement, said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Washington-based Center for Immigration Studies, which has done studies on the costs of illegal immigration. In fact, Houston police do not ask people what their immigration status is during routine patrols. "We have limited resources" and leave it to the federal government to enforce immigration laws, said HPD Assistant Chief Dan Perales. Houston is in Harris County, whose sheriff, Adrian Garcia, likewise defends the practice of not checking the immigration status of residents who aren't in jail. Garcia said: "You don’t want to create a chill factor. You don’t want people to spend time wondering whether they're going to be asked about their immigration status versus (officers) getting information on the gang member who just shot somebody." Other cities do the same. Austin Police Department policy states: "Officers will not stop persons for the sole purpose of determining immigration status." However, Harris County is in a federal program called 287(g) that authorizes local law officers to enforce immigration laws. When Houston police arrest people for crimes more serious than Class C misdemeanors, they are turned over to the county, which was an earlier adopter of the Department of Homeland Security's Secure Communities program. That program enables fingerprints of arrested individuals to be checked against federal crime and immigration databases. After the shooting of a Houston police officer by an illegal immigrant in March 2009, White asked the federal government to expedite the city’s entry into the 287(g) program, according to The Houston Chronicle. But White shifted course in October, saying that joining the Secure Communities program instead would entail no special agreement with the Department of Homeland Security nor cost as much, the newspaper reported. The Houston Police Department joined Secure Communities and started using the same databases in mid-December. Perales said they have helped the city identify possible illegal immigrants plus individuals wanted in other states for other reasons. The Houston Police Department joined the Secure Communities program and started using its databases in mid-December. Perales said the data has helped the city identify possible illegal immigrants plus individuals wanted in other states for other reasons. Vaughan said that because the county and city have stepped up efforts to identify illegal immigrants, she no longer views the city as much of a sanctuary. Vaughan said in a blog posted Friday, however, that from early March 2008 to Sept. 30, 2009, the Secure Communities program as employed by Harris County failed to identify nearly half the illegal immigrants snagged via the county's 287(g) participation. "Why the difference?" her blog states. "Secure Communities can only flag those aliens whose (fingerprints) or identifying information is already in immigration databases." She writes that the results gap "represents underachievement on a large scale." None of this proves Adams' claim that White "offered sanctuary to illegal immigrants." The Congressional Research Service did list Houston among localities with sanctuary policies. Yet the only overt action on White's watch was the decision, at the end of his six years in office, to join the Secure Communities program -- a federal initiative intended to make it harder, not easier, for illegal immigrants to remain in this country. Whether the White administration's approach helped make illegal immigrants feel at ease in Houston is another question -- and not the one Adams raised. We rate her sanctuary statement as False.

pomt-03115	"There are more guns than there are people in the United States."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/19/eleanor-holmes-norton/del-norton-says-more-guns-people-us-navy-yard-reac/	In the wake of Monday’s Navy Yard shooting, Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., addressed national and civic security. Holmes, the nonvoting delegate to Congress representing the District of Columbia, praised the quick police response, but she also noted that no one is entirely insulated from criminal acts. "We understand that in an open and democratic and free society, you cannot make yourself impenetrable, especially when there are more guns than there are people in the United States today," she said in a press conference. Are there really more guns than people? We wanted to dig into the data. Let’s pin down the easy number: population. The U.S. Census Bureau puts the 2010 population at 308.7 million people. We can get even closer with their nifty population clock, which on the day we checked it estimated a population of nearly 317 million, based on migration, birth and death rates. Now that we have a frame of reference for Norton’s comparison, let’s move to the question of the number of civilian guns in the country, a murkier subject. As we’ve noted, federally sponsored gun research is scarce. Most of the available studies are estimates. Since most states don’t register guns or license owners, there’s no concrete thing to count, said Jon Vernick, co-director of the Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. This June, at President Barack Obama’s request, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a report rounding up what we know about firearm ownership and usage. It offered a 2007 estimate of 294 million guns, but with a pretty hefty caveat: "Basic information about gun possession, acquisition, and storage is lacking," the report read. "No single database captures the total number, locations, and types of firearms and firearm owners in the United States." The National Rifle Association usually describes the number as "approaching 300 million," spokesman Andrew Arulanandam wrote in an email. Daniel van Hoogstraten, Norton’s spokesman, pointed us to a Congressional Research Service study that goes with a slightly higher ballpark: 310 million as of 2009. He made the case that gun proliferation in the country has been increasing at a quick enough rate to exceed the population. While that’s an interesting theory, we found no evidence to back it up. Since the CRS number is from 2009, the closest apples-to-apples comparison we can make is using the U.S. Census population from 2010. So that's about 310 million guns to 308.7 million people. Again, we can't get a firm grip on how much the guns number has changed since then, but the population has gone up by almost nine million, according to the Census estimate. Our ruling Norton claimed there are "more guns than there are people in the United States." There’s no way to know for sure how many guns there are, given the available data. The highest credible guns number we saw was 310 million, which bests the 2010 population by over a million. But it falls short of the 2013 population estimate. We don't have any reliable gun surveys to approximate 2013 numbers. There's a chance Norton is right, but the available evidence isn't definitive. We rate Norton’s claim Half True.

pomt-08857	"Florida is now the No. 1 state in the country for automobile accident fraud."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/aug/05/holly-benson/holly-benson-claims-florida-leads-country-automobi/	Fraud was a hot topic during the July 31, 2010, debate between Pam Bondi, Jeff Kottkamp and Holly Benson, all Republican candidates for Florida attorney general. At one point, Bay News 9 anchor and debate co-host Al Ruechel asked, "Why is it that Florida is so ripe for all sorts of fraud? Mortgage fraud, Medicaid fraud, and what can the AG's (Attorney General) office do to cut that down?" Benson was the last candidate to answer the question, beginning her response by saying, "You know, even yesterday I read that Florida is now the number one state in the country for automobile accident fraud." She then returned to Medicaid and went on to say that she would put in place "laws with teeth" so that the "bad guys would get put away" and that they wouldn't be able to use Medicaid as a money-making scheme. We've heard a lot about mortgage and Medicaid fraud, but not so much about automobile accident fraud, so we decided to look into it. Benson's office sent us a link to an article published by the South Florida Sun Sentinel, on May 11, 2010. The article points to a May 2010 report from the National Insurance Crime Bureau, which describes itself as a "leading not-for-profit organization exclusively dedicated to preventing, detecting and defeating insurance fraud and vehicle theft." Nearly 1,100 property and casualty insurance companies and self-insured organizations support the NICB, according to the group's website. The NICB report says that questionable claims involving possible staged accidents increased 46 percent from 2007 through 2009. Broken down by state, Florida leads the pack, with 3,006 questionable claims submitted. New York came in second, with 1,680 claims. On a city level, New York City was the clear winner -- 1,304 questionable claims were submitted by NICB's insurance members between 2007 and 2009. Tampa was second with 562 claims submitted during the same time period. Right away, we notice that the NICB report that Benson's campaign seems to be relying on is not a ranking of the number of auto insurance fraud convictions by state. As Frank Scafidi, director of public affairs for the NICB, explained to us in an e-mail, "Our staged accident reports ... are based on the voluntary submission, or referral, of insurance claims deemed 'questionable' by the companies handling them. These are claims that are suspicious and may contain some indication of potential fraud so companies can elect to refer them to us for further review and investigation." Just because a claim is submitted as questionable, however, does not necessarily indicate that fraud occurred. "The mere referral of a claim in no way deems it fraudulent and many questionable claims turn out to be perfectly legitimate," Scafidi said. Unfortunately, NICB was unable to provide us with the number of questionable claims that turned out to be legitimate. We also contacted the Insurance Research Council, an industry-backed group that provides "timely and reliable empirical research to all parties involved in public policy issues affecting risk and insurance." David Corum, the group's vice president, told us that the organization conducted its own analysis of auto insurance fraud. The report, published in November 2008, looked at more than 42,000 claims submitted by 22 insurance companies that represented 57 percent of the U.S. private passenger market in 2006. The claims were reviewed for evidence of either fraud or buildup. The group defines fraud as a "specific material misrepresentation of the facts of a loss." Buildup, on the other hand, sometimes also referred to as soft fraud, is defined "as the inflation of an otherwise legitimate claim." The report found that Florida led the country both in terms of the number of claims suspected of fraud and buildup. More specifically, 22 percent of bodily injury claims submitted in Florida involved apparent fraud and 41 percent involved apparent buildup. Among Florida personal injury protection claims, the apparent fraud rate was 10 percent, and the rate of apparent buildup was 30 percent. Finally, we spoke with James Quiggle, director of communications for the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud, a nonprofit anti-fraud watchdog group. He told us that "Florida is arguably the nation's epicenter of counterfeit crashes, the eye of the no-fault hurricane." Still, as the organization's own website points out, "no single national agency gathers omnibus fraud statistics. Insurance fraud data thus are relatively piecemeal, making our understanding of insurance fraud an ongoing work in progress." To recap. Benson claimed that Florida is now the No. 1 state in the country for automobile accident fraud. We spoke with industry experts and reviewed existing literature on the topic, and found that she was largely correct. Data from both the National Insurance Crime Bureau and the Insurance Research Council show that Florida had the biggest number of claims that either the insurance companies or independent reviewers found of questionable legitimacy. Still, those figures only represent likely or potential fraud, not confirmed cases of fraud. We rate this Mostly True.	None	Holly Benson	None	None	None	2010-08-05T18:22:00	2010-07-31	['None']
pomt-07290	"If you take the population growth here in Virginia, we are net zero on job creation since (Bob McDonnell) became governor."	true	/virginia/statements/2011/may/21/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-mcdonnell-job-creation-effort-hasnt/	Former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe was not kind to Gov. Bob McDonnell’s jobs record in a recent speech. McAuliffe, who ran unsuccessfully in the 2009 Democratic gubernatorial primary, said the state’s employment situation has regressed since McDonnell, a Republican, became governor in January 2010. "We have not gone forward. We have gone backwards," McAuliffe, who is considering another run for governor in 2013, said in a May 7 speech at a Democratic rally. "I know Bob is for jobs, talks about these great press releases. But if you take the population growth here in Virginia, we are net zero on job creation since he became governor." Has Virginia’s population growth outpaced its job growth since McDonnell became governor? We decided to check. Levar Stoney, McAuliffe’s spokesman, told us the information came from a January 2011 report by The Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis, a think tank that focuses on economic issues facing low and moderate-income residents. The study said if the pace of Virginia’s job growth between February through December of 2010 continues, it would take until 2022 to return the state to its pre-recession employment levels. That report, however, does not include the specific statement McAuliffe made about the state’s job growth trailing its population increase under McDonnell. So we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics figures to see if McAuliffe was right. The BLS compiles monthly figures from a survey of households showing how the size of each state’s working-age population compares to its number of residents who are employed. Working-age population is defined as the number of people 16 or older who are not in the military, incarcerated or in mental institutions. We’ll start with February 2010, McDonnell’s first full month in office. Virginia’s working-age population was 6,049,306 that month. The number of employed residents was 3,891,279. That means 64.3 percent of the state’s working-age population had jobs. In March, 2011 -- the latest BLS figures -- Virginia’s working-age population was 6,125,642. There were 3,931,679 employed Virginians -- 64.2 percent of the working-age population. So in March 2011, the percentage of the state’s working-age population with jobs was one-tenth of 1 percent lower than in February 2010. The working-age population had risen 76,336 over the span, while the number of employed residents went up by 40,400. McAuliffe is right that the state’s population increase has outpaced the rise in number of jobs. But that trend is not is not unique to Virginia. Between February 2010 and March 2011, only a dozen states saw their number of employed residents rise faster than the increase in their working age populations, according to the BLS. Nationwide, the percentage of working-age people with jobs was at 58.5 in February 2010 and in March 2011. Virginia has easily outperformed the national average every month during that span since McDonnell became governor. We don’t point this out to take McDonnell’s side. We merely note there is a universe of employment statistics that politicians sift to paint favorable pictures of their own performance creating jobs and disparage the work of opponents. McAuliffe did not address the record of his fellow Democrat Tim Kaine, who preceded McDonnell as governor. But Kaine, who is running for the U.S. Senate next year, is open to the same criticism McAuliffe aimed at McDonnell. In February 2006, Kaine’s first full month in office, 66.5 percent of the state’s working age population had a job. By December 2009, Kaine’s last full month, it dropped to 64.2 percent. Virginia’s working-age population rose 275,496 during Kaine’s term while the number of employed people only increased by 48,249. To sum up: McAuliffe said that since McDonnell became governor in January 2010, the state’s population growth has outpaced its job growth. McDonnell is a Republican. McAuliffe does not note that the same trend existed when his fellow Democrat Tim Kaine was governor from from 2006 to 2010. Economists say governors have little control over economic conditions. Virginia has consistently had one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation this century. Those points aside, McDonnell bills himself as a job-creating governor. McAuliffe accurately summarized one set of statistics about employment in Virginia during McDonnell’s term. We rate his statement True.

pomt-03569	"The IRS will have the ability potentially" to deny or delay health care.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/20/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-irs-will-have-ability-delay-/	Last week was a bad one for the Internal Revenue Service. First, it faced widespread criticism over revelations that officials gave extra scrutiny to tea party and other conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status. Now, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., is charging that the IRS may be able to deny Americans the right to health care. During a May 15, 2013, interview on Fox News’ On the Record with Greta Van Susteren, Bachmann linked the IRS to a longtime target of hers, President Barack Obama’s health care law. Referring to an inspector general’s report on the IRS scrutiny of conservative groups, Bachmann said, "So now we find out these people are making decisions based on our politics and beliefs, and they're going to be in charge of our health care There's a huge national database that's being created right now. Your health care, my health care, all the Fox viewers health care, their personal, intimate, most close to the vest secrets will be in that database, and the IRS is in charge of that database? So the IRS will have the ability potentially -- will they? -- to deny health care, to deny access, to delay health care? This is serious! Based upon our political beliefs? That's why we have to repeal Obamacare. And I still think it's possible." We’ll be looking at a few claims from this exchange. In this item, we’ll focus on whether it’s accurate to say that "the IRS will have the ability potentially" to deny or delay health care. In an interview with PolitiFact after Bachmann’s appearance on Van Susteren’s show, Dan Kotman, a spokesman for Bachmann, said she stood by the concerns she expressed. "Now that we know the IRS has abused its power for political purposes, it is reasonable to ask what other steps would they take to punish their political opponents," Kotman said. This is an especially big concern, Kotman said, in the wake of revelations that Sarah Hall Ingram -- the former commissioner of the IRS' tax-exempt and government-entities division -- is now in charge of an IRS office that oversees tax-related issues relating to the health care law. Kotman argued that it would be possible for the IRS to use the information it collects on taxpayers and their health coverage for political purposes. "Based on that information, one possible outcome is that they can levy punitive taxes that could force employers to drop coverage," Kotman said. The IRS has a number of roles in implementing the health care law -- the agency has posted a list that includes everything from levying additional payroll taxes on certain high-income Americans to taxation of medical devices and brand-name drugs. Its best known role, beginning in 2014, is to confirm that a taxpayer has health insurance and to assess a financial penalty if they do not. (The penalties start at $95 per adult in 2013 and rise to $695 per adult in 2016.) None of the above, however, supports the idea that the IRS can "deny" or "delay" health care for an individual or a family. But there is one area in which IRS actions could delay Americans from getting health care. It stems from the agency’s role in approving federal subsidies for purchasing health insurance on the newly created insurance exchanges. Let’s recap how this part of the law works. The law establishes "exchanges" that are intended to be operational by 2014. Using these exchanges, people who need insurance will be able to comparison-shop for plans that suit their needs. While some people will pay all of the resulting premiums, many will qualify for subsidies. The subsidies operate on a sliding scale, and are available to those who earn between 133 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level. An estimated 28.6 million Americans might be eligible for the subsidies in 2014, though the Congressional Budget Office has suggested that many fewer Americans will actually sign up, at least at first -- 6 million in 2014 and 22 million in 2017. Even if the lower estimates of signup rates are true, that will mean that millions of Americans will need to secure approval from the IRS to obtain subsidies. This process is supposed to start this fall, to enable applicants to purchase coverage in time for calendar year 2014. So will the IRS be ready? An IRS spokeswoman said the agency "is on track with implementing its role in the Affordable Care Act," but otherwise directed inquiries to the Department of Health and Human Services. In a statement to PolitiFact, HHS said applicants for financial assistance will be part of the exchange process and that verification "will take place in near-real time" with several federal databases, including an IRS database. Experts we contacted for this story said that Bachmann’s scenario -- that the IRS picks and chooses who gets a subsidy based on an applicant’s political beliefs -- is almost impossible to imagine, even after the recent revelations. But they said it was more plausible that mundane logistical challenges could delay individuals’ efforts to secure subsidies. At a bureaucracy as large as the IRS, and with laws as complicated as this one, it’s possible that individuals could -- indirectly and inadvertently -- find themselves delayed or denied in getting health coverage. It’s not hard to imagine glitches cropping up and delaying someone from getting approval to purchase insurance on the exchange. It could be especially tricky for Americans who don’t file returns because they don’t owe taxes beyond what’s taken from their paycheck. We "don’t know what will happen if the IRS is unable to make these determinations in a ‘timely' way," said Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush and who is now a health policy consultant. And even in the best of situations, computer systems aren’t perfect. "One big concern about whether the exchanges will work is whether computers from different government agencies can talk to each other," said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute. Brookings Institution senior fellow Elaine Kamarck recently suggested a possible scenario in which the federal online system for exchanges "may not be able to interface with statewide data and eligibility could become a lengthy bureaucratic process." We should emphasize that if these delays do come to pass, it won’t be about "political beliefs," as Bachmann put it, and it won’t be something IRS intended to happen. It would be about something much more mundane -- bureaucratic snags. "She is trying to make the IRS sound like it has a malevolent power to limit medical care that it does not have," said Jonathan Oberlander, a professor of social medicine and health policy and management at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Our ruling Bachmann said "the IRS will have the ability potentially" to deny or delay health care. She makes it sound like the IRS would purposefully deny or delay people from getting health coverage, perhaps based on an applicant’s political beliefs. Experts told us that was extremely far-fetched. But if complicated logistical challenges are not met, there is a chance that IRS could inadvertently end up delaying some of the millions of uninsured Americans seeking subsidies from purchasing insurance on the exchanges. We rate Bachmann’s claim Mostly False.	None	Michele Bachmann	None	None	None	2013-05-20T12:01:56	2013-05-15	['None']
pomt-09700	"As a result of the House Republican bill, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office now confirms that families will see their health care premiums reduced by up to 10 percent."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/06/mike-pence/us-rep-mike-pence-says-cbo-confirms-gop-health-pla/	A day after the GOP released its 219-page alternative health care bill, U.S. Rep. Mike Pence, chairman of the House Republican Conference, sent out a press release boasting that the "the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office now confirms that families will see their health care premiums reduced by up to 10 percent." Lowering health care costs -- rather than reducing the ranks of the uninsured -- has been the primary focus of many Republicans in Congress, and so we wanted to check out Pence's claim. First, a few words about the Congressional Budget Office, or CBO. The nonpartisan budget agency calculates how much bills in Congress will cost the government. Political leaders and others regularly turn to the CBO as the definitive source for budget projections. And here's what the CBO concluded about how the GOP health care plan would affect private health insurance premiums: • For the small group market (generally businesses with two to 50 employees -- about 15 percent of the private market), the GOP plan would reduce average premiums in 2016 by 7 to 10 percent compared with amounts under current law. • For the individual market (just over 5 percent of the private market), the GOP plan would reduce premiums in 2016 by 5 to 8 percent. • And for the large group market (which represents 80 percent of private premiums), the GOP plan would reduce premiums in 2016 by 0 to 3 percent. The CBO cautioned that those estimates are "very preliminary and are subject to an unusually high degree of uncertainty" because of the difficulty in trying to untangle how various proposals in the plan might affect premiums. But you can see what Pence has done. The Indiana congressman cherry-picked the most favorable number to put the GOP plan in the best light. Yes, for people in the small market group, the CBO estimates they could see average premiums reduced in 2016 by "up to 10 percent" compared with amounts under current law. But only 15 percent of the total private premiums fall into that category. The overwhelming majority, 80 percent of people paying private premiums, are in the large market group. And for them, the CBO estimates the GOP plan would reduce premiums in 2016 by 0 to 3 percent. But Pence did say "up to," providing himself with some very broad wiggle room. And so we rate Pence's statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a2bc5368-e052-449d-b9e1-d63c5904a6fb	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2009-11-06T13:58:24	2009-11-05	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-13384	In New York City, "murders are up."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/27/donald-trump/donald-trump-base-saying-murders-are-new-york-city/	Two New Yorkers, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, mixed it up over crime stats in the Big Apple at the first presidential debate in Hempstead, N.Y. Here’s their exchange, prompted by Donald Trump’s suggestion that police should expand the use of "stop and frisk" policies to curb crime. Trump: "Stop and frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City, tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact." Clinton: "Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders. So there is -- " Trump: "No, you're wrong. You're wrong." Clinton: "No, I'm not." Trump: "Murders are up. All right. You check it." And so we will. Is it correct that "murders are up" in New York City, as Trump said? The most recent statistics from the New York Police Department show that murders in New York City are falling. The data, which cover the period between Sept. 12 and Sept. 18, 2016, compare various crimes, including murder, over a series of time frames. Here’s the summary: Period 2015 murder figure 2016 murder figure Increase or decline Week to date 6 3 -50 percent Past 28 days 35 24 -31.4 percent Year to date 257 246 -4.3 percent 2 years ago to date -- -- +7.9 percent 6 years ago to date -- -- -36.1 percent 23 years ago to date -- -- -82.7 percent So, in five of the six time periods offered by the NYPD -- including the past year to date, the figure most commonly cited in the media -- crime has fallen. In only one time frame, comparing year to date 2016 to year to date 2014, did the number of murders increase. And in fact, this is essentially what the Trump campaign pointed to when we asked them to support the candidate’s claim. They noted that during the full year of 2014, there were 333 murders, a number that rose to 352 in the full year of 2015. That’s about a 6 percent increase. Still, this is just one cherry-picked time frame. And a NYPD spokesman rejected Trump’s statement via Twitter during the debate. J. Peter Donald, the NYPD's assistant commissioner for communication and public information, tweeted, "Additionally, #NYC is on pace to have one of the safest years on record for crime. Murders, shootings are (down arrow) significantly." In the meantime, we’ll note that the data in the NYPD release went on to compare year-end data from 2015 to four previous years and found that it is well below its previous levels -- consistent with a quarter-century decline in violent crime. According to the NYPD data, murder was down by 45.8 percent compared to 2001, down by 44 percent compared to 1998, down by 81.7 percent compared to 1993, and down by 84.4 percent compared to 1990. The year-to-date data for rape, felonious assault and grand larceny are up by between 1 percent and 3.5 percent. But Trump was specific about referring to murder. And statistics released by the FBI the morning of the debate that showed murders rose nationally by 10.8 percent in 2015, the biggest one-year percentage jump since 1971. But again, those are national figures, not murders in New York City. So among the time frames released by the NYPD, there’s only one comparison where Trump would be correct -- today compared to two years ago. In general, murders are down in New York City for almost any time period you can look at. Our ruling At the debate, Trump said that In New York City, "murders are up." For virtually any time frame you can look at, including the year to date, murders in New York City are down. We rate the statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1c058516-fb5d-4fc7-8530-1291324b44f8	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-09-27T15:42:07	2016-09-26	['New_York_City']
pomt-15168	"The federal government right now does not deport criminals."	false	/florida/statements/2015/aug/26/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-obama-administration-not-deporting-c/	Jeb Bush says that the federal government needs to start deporting criminals. "The federal government right now does not deport criminals," he said at a town hall in New Hampshire on Aug. 19. "I don't believe that we should take people that are here in the shadows and deport them all -- the cost of that would be in the hundreds of billions of dollars, it would rip up communities -- it's not appropriate. But criminals should be deported, and right now the Obama administration is not doing that." Bush was essentially bashing GOP frontrunner Donald Trump for his immigration plans, which include deporting millions of illegal immigrants. But is Bush correct that Obama's administration is not deporting criminals? In a word, no. Deportations under Obama The Bush campaign sent us news articles and reports including a fact-check by PolitiFact showing that tens of thousands of criminal illegal immigrants have avoided deportation. This has been a particularly hot topic since a convicted felon who had previously been deported five times murdered a woman in San Francisco this summer. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has written stories about criminals who have avoided deportation. For example, a West African drifter who spent 15 years in state prison for sexually battering a woman walked out of an Atlanta jail and ignored orders to report to federal immigration authorities seeking to deport him and instead disappeared. The newspaper reported in May 2015 that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement authorities based in Atlanta were hunting 8,647 fugitives with criminal convictions ranging from minor drug offenses to murder in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. But while there are cases of criminals who have avoided deportation, there are still tens of thousands of people who have, in fact, been deported. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement, called ICE, removed 315,943 illegal immigrants in fiscal year 2014. About two-thirds were caught while attempting to cross the border, while one-third were removed from the interior. About 85 percent of all interior removals were individuals previously convicted of a crime. That means that 86,923 convicted criminals were deported for a crime outside of breaking an immigration law. The ICE removal statistics did not provide details about the types of crimes committed, except to state that about 1 percent were suspected or confirmed gang members. We were not able to get complete data from ICE by our deadline to show what percentage of deported illegal immigrants had been convicted of felonies. However, the New York Times published an analysis in April 2014 based on government data obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. The newspaper found that since Obama had taken office, "two-thirds of the nearly two million deportation cases involve people who had committed minor infractions, including traffic violations, or had no criminal record at all. Twenty percent — or about 394,000 — of the cases involved people convicted of serious crimes, including drug-related offenses, the records show." The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University published an analysis in 2014 that looked at deportations during the previous year. It found that 1,172 were deported for homicide, 3,325 for sexual assault, and 47,249 for traffic offenses. The deportation guidelines changed in November 2014, when Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson issued a memo saying that the new top priority would include those suspected of terrorism, gang members and convicted felons. The second priority level includes those convicted of serious misdemeanors. The guidelines are more narrow and specific than the ones it replaced from 2010-11. The Migration Policy Institute estimated that 13 percent of illegal immigrants fall into the new priorities compared with 27 percent previously. These policies have come in for criticism by those who would like to see more vigorous enforcement of immigration law. "It’s true that a large percentage of the people deported have criminal convictions," said Jessica Vaughan, an expert at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration. "It’s also true that the Obama administration is choosing not to deport many convicted criminals, and also choosing to release many deportable criminals, while offering them generous due process (which they often abuse) instead of using the most efficient due process that is more likely to result in deportation." Our ruling Bush said, "The federal government right now does not deport criminals." Bush points to reports that many criminal illegal immigrants have been released, and there is evidence that it sometimes happens. But it is an exaggeration to say that none are deported. Last year, ICE deported about 86,000 illegal immigrants convicted of previous crimes. We rate this claim False.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2015-08-26T10:36:09	2015-08-19	['None']

In an undated fake news post, kbr31.com announced that DiCaprio told an undisclosed magazine in an interview he would be moving to Casselberry because he is looking for a "big change" in his life. "I’m just tired of the L.A. lifestyle and I feel like, at this point in my life, I’d rather just live in a place full of real, genuine people," the post quotes him as saying. "I’ve been to Casselberry, Fla., a couple of times over the years and the people there are real… they’re genuine, and yeah every community has its problems but the people there are good, decent people and they care about their community. Those are the things I find most important in deciding where to live." Casselberry is a real city, located ten miles north of downtown Orlando. But it isn't the Oscar winner’s new hometown. This isn’t the first time DiCaprio is quoted as saying this, though, nor is Casselberry the celebrity’s only alleged haven from the L.A. lifestyle. Fake news sites have announced DiCaprio’s moves to Gilroy, Calif., Woodstock, Ill., Temple, Ariz., Warren, Mich., Swedesboro, N.J., and even to small towns overseas, including Naas in Ireland and Guilford in England. The stories appear on a chain of websites that seem to bank on readers clicking on particular versions of the post to generate advertising revenue. The sites’ names sound like official media outlets, like "WCRK 35" or "Q 102." The sites are also known for including various versions of stories that falsely claim an event has happened. We previously debunked a fake news story that celebrities’ cars were breaking down in small towns. Every version of these stories is almost identical, though, with a different town name.The other element that sometimes changes is the name of the celebrity leaving L.A. in search of "good, decent people" who care about their community. If you believe these Internet rumors, you will find that Will Ferrell is moving to Yuba City, Calif.; Ben Affleck to Delray Beach, Fla.; Miley Cyrus to Sedalia, Mo.; Eminem to Rocklin, Calif.; Scarlett Johansson to Clovis, Calif.; Matt Damon to Missoula, Mont.; and Bill Murray to Salisbury, Mass. Needless to say, there is no evidence any of these celebs are packing their bags and heading to your suburb any time soon. Although there is no banner on this or any of the other posts announcing they are fake, a disclaimer on the website announces that kbr31.com is a satirical and fantasy website. "None of the articles on kbr31.com should be considered true and are simply works of satire or fantasy meant for entertainment purposes," the disclaimer said.

pomt-05187	Says under Mitt Romney, Massachusetts was 47th in job creation.	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/jun/13/julian-castro/julian-castro-says-under-mitt-romney-massachusetts/	Praising President Barack Obama at the expense of his likely Republican opponent, San Antonio’s mayor told fellow Democrats that Mitt Romney is not the best solution to the nation’s unemployment. "As governor, his state ranked 47th in the nation in job creation -- almost dead last," Julián Castro said in his speech June 8, 2012, on the main floor of the Texas Democratic Party State Convention. This claim is one PolitiFact has tackled before in similar forms: Obama campaign adviser David Axelrod hung the jobless ranking on Romney on June 19, 2011, and on June 3, 2012. Both times, PolitiFact rated the statement Half True, saying that Massachusetts’ 47th-place ranking was correct but that it was inaccurate to say Romney was responsible. In our first fact-check on this number, PolitiFact traced the claim back to the Democratic National Committee, which cited a 2010 Wall Street Journal news story. PolitiFact also ran the numbers itself, using Bureau of Labor Relations data, and asked the taxpayer-backed Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, which does nonpartisan analysis of the state's financial and economic statistics, to do the same. Every way PolitiFact sliced the jobs numbers, Massachusetts was 47th. But in that item and many others, economists have consistently told us that policies of a governor have a relatively small impact on a state's economy. Michael Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, warned us not to put too much stock in any governor's influence over their state's rate of job growth. The ability for governors to manage the state economy is vastly overrated, Widmer said. States are tied to larger economic forces, he added, and governors often claim too much credit when things are going well and no blame when things are going poorly. Castro’s political consultant, Christian Archer, sent us a June 5, 2012, New York Times news story supporting the statistic, and also said that as a co-chair of Obama for America, the mayor has received material from the president citing the same ranking. Archer said Castro was offering the ranking as evidence Romney would not be as strong on job creation as Obama. Our ruling The job-creation ranking for Massachusetts is right; the implication that Romney is solely to blame for the state’s low standing does not hold up. We give Castro, like Axelrod before him, a Half True.	None	Julián Castro	None	None	None	2012-06-13T11:18:13	2012-06-08	['Massachusetts', 'Mitt_Romney']
pomt-06597	Says he "got lobbied" by a woman with late-stage cancer about vaccinating Texas girls against a virus that can cause cervical cancer.	false	/texas/statements/2011/sep/23/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-he-got-lobbied-woman-late-stage-ca/	In the Sept. 22, 2011, Republican presidential debate, Gov. Rick Perry again defended his foiled 2007 attempt to require Texas girls to be vaccinated against a virus that can cause cervical cancer. Perry, responding to U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann’s charge that his Feb. 2, 2007, order intended to mandate the shots for human papillomavirus, or HPV, was an inappropriate result of lobbying by his former chief of staff, said: "I got lobbied on this issue. I got lobbied by a 31-year-old young lady who had stage 4 cervical cancer. I spent a lot of time with her. She came by my office, talked to me about this program." Did a cancer patient urge Perry to issue the order later nulled by Texas legislators? Nearly three weeks after Perry issued the order, it was widely reported that a Houston woman with late-stage cervical cancer had visited with him. As reported in the Feb. 20, 2007, Austin American-Statesman, Heather Burcham of Houston spoke to reporters summoned by Perry as numerous legislators were indicating they would try to cancel the order. Burcham said then: "The vaccine has done its job if it saves one person from cancer, let alone knocks out cervical cancer altogether." She also signed up to testify at a Texas House hearing, the Statesman reported, but left before she was called to speak. Earlier in the day, she said she wanted to spend the time she had left sharing her story: "It's my wildest dream come true that I get to maybe reach one person, that my life would not be in vain, that I have lived for a purpose and that I won't die and never have done anything," she said. Fast forward. Shortly after the Sept. 22 debate, ABC News said Perry did not meet Burcham until after he’d issued his order. Its news article says Perry "met Burcham while she was lobbying the Texas legislature to uphold the governor’s executive order. The Legislature ultimately ruled against Burcham and Perry and did away with the vaccine mandate." The network, crediting a recent report by Houston’s KTRK-TV, said Perry and Burcham "struck up a friendship despite the Texas Legislature revoking the governor’s mandate. Perry invited Burcham to a ranch, rode motorcycles with her and even sat at her bed during her final days. Burcham died in July 2007." A pre-debate ABC News post, dated Sept. 15, 2011, specifies that Perry and Burcham struck up the friendship after he issued the order. According to a Sept. 23, 2011, Houston Chronicle blog post, Perry spokesman Mark Miner confirmed that Burcham met Perry when she began lobbying the lawmakers to uphold his order. The post quotes Miner saying: "It was a very inspirational passionate story that he heard from her and he met with her away from the cameras and really built up a relationship with this young girl. Yes, he had (already) signed it, but it was still going through the legislative process. It had a heavy impact on him." As noted Sept. 17, 2011, by Fort Worth Star-Telegram columnist Bud Kennedy, Perry’s YouTube posts include a video of Burcham, in a hospital bed, shown at a May 2007 Perry press conference. Seated in a bed, Burcham says: "I want to change as many people’s lives as I can because I know there is nothing I can do for my own life, but there is something that I can do for others ... It is so important that parents get their children this vaccination." Finally, we interviewed Houston developer Craig Wilson, who said Burcham lived with his family off and on for about a decade before she died. Wilson said he doesn’t recall the exact date that Burcham met Perry, though they developed a relationship when she was urging legislators not to unplug the order. "He did everything he could to make her life better," Wilson said, ultimately spending three hours at her bedside before she died and later delivering a eulogy. "This shows his character as a human being." Our ruling: Perry had an ally in Heather Burcham in 2007, but only after he issued his order. In the debate, in contrast, Perry brought up Burcham’s heartfelt advocacy while not speaking to criticism he had been lobbied into the order by a former aide representing a drug company. His statement misled by creating the impression Burcham swayed him to proceed with the executive order. In reality, by all accounts, that just didn’t happen. We rate Perry’s statement False.

pomt-14699	"We get practically nothing compared to the cost of" keeping U.S. military forces in South Korea.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/10/donald-trump/donald-trump-mostly-wrong-we-get-practically-nothi/	Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is saying it’s time for South Korea to pick up more of the costs of having United States military forces in South Korea. During an extended interview with NBC’s Meet the Press from Ottumwa, Iowa, Trump addressed the situation on the Korean peninsula, where North Korea re-emerged in the news in recent days with the purported test of a hydrogen bomb by the regime of Kim Jong Un. "We have 28,000 soldiers on the line in South Korea between the madman and them," Trump said, referring to Kim. "We get practically nothing compared to the cost of this." This is not the first time Trump has used this talking point. In 2011, we checked this claim about South Korea: "We have 25,000 soldiers over there protecting them. They don't pay us. Why don't they pay us?" We rated the claim that South Korea doesn't pay False, noting that South Korea had picked up the tab for nearly $700 million in the most recent year for personnel, logistics and construction costs. On Meet the Press, Trump made a slightly less absolute statement. Rather than saying, "They don't pay us," he said, "We get practically nothing compared to the cost." So we took another look at this assertion. The Joint Security Area at the demilitarized zone between North Korea and South Korea in 2009, with South Korean soldiers in the foreground and a North Korean soldier in the distance. (Wikimedia Commons) We found that South Korea does still pay for the U.S. presence, which currently includes roughly 28,500 military personnel. (That’s far smaller than the roughly 500,000 South Korean service members on active duty, plus many more South Korean reserve troops.) In fact, South Korea pays quite a bit more than they did in 2011. In the most recent agreement, announced in early 2014, South Korea said it would pay $866.6 million that year to support the U.S. presence. That was 5.8 percent higher than the 2013 amount, and that could grow by as much as 4 percent annually through 2018. So is this "practically nothing compared to the cost" of a U.S. military presence, as Trump argues? Calculating the South Korean financial burden on a percentage basis is tricky, because it’s difficult to determine how much it "costs" the United States to station military personnel in South Korea. Do you include the annual salaries and benefits for the troops in question, or do you also include their equipment and past training? If you look at the most straightforward amount -- salary and benefits for 28,500 troops, which according to experts is roughly $100,000 a head -- then South Korea’s payments account for slightly more than 30 percent of U.S. costs in 2014. "It's hard to argue that more than $800 million annually is ‘peanuts’ or ‘next to nothing,’ " said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University. Beyond that, several experts said Trump’s apparent premise -- that the United States is giving a growing, affluent country what amounts to a charitable gift -- is wrong. The United States itself benefits from the military investment in South Korea, they said. "U.S. forces are no longer there strictly to defend South Korea," said William W. Stueck, historian at the University of Georgia. "They are there to enhance regional stability as well. The point is that we have vital interests in East Asia and the Western Pacific, so why shouldn't we pay part of the bill for our force presence?" Janda concurred: "The traditional argument for keeping troops in South Korea is that it deters North Korea from attacking South Korea, stabilizes the region politically, socially, and economically, and gives the United States bases from which it can project military power throughout the western Pacific. In addition, he said, the military expense helps protect countries that buy U.S. products, he said. Allan R. Millett, a historian and director of the Eisenhower Center for American Studies at the National World War II Museum in New Orleans, agreed. "Alliances are not to be measured in dollars, but in their effectiveness at deterring conflict," he said. It’s also worth pointing out that South Korea’s willingness to share the costs means that it’s cheaper for U.S. military to support those 28,500 troops, compared to having them stationed elsewhere, even at bases in the United States. Reasonable people can disagree, Janda said, about whether South Korea is paying "enough," and whether the United States might be better off protecting South Korea with air and naval power rather than a sizable ground presence. Janda added that it’s possible to argue that the U.S. military presence "is partially destabilizing because it makes the Chinese and North Koreans nervous, and that we are too quick to see the world in purely military terms." Still, he said, "I don't hear Trump making nuanced arguments like that." Our ruling Trump said, "We get practically nothing compared to the cost of" keeping U.S. military forces in South Korea. Currently, South Korea pays well over $800 million annually to support the United States’ troop presence, an amount that doesn’t qualify as "practically nothing." And while Trump makes it sound like the United States’ willingness to pay the rest of the freight amounts to a gift to South Korea, he overlooks that the United States actually benefits significantly on a strategic level from the arrangement. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-01-10T13:47:38	2016-01-10	['United_States', 'South_Korea']
pomt-00806	"Not a single unarmed white person has been shot by the police" in New York in about 45 years.	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/apr/01/fran-lebowitz/fran-lebowitz-claims-nypd-has-never-shot-unarmed-w/	Don’t get sardonic New York City writer Fran Lebowitz started on Rudy Giuliani. She is no fan of the former New York mayor and conservative pundit, especially after he loudly questioned President Barack Obama’s love for the United States. HBO host Bill Maher got an earful on the subject when he invited Lebowitz to appear in a panel about Giuliani’s rhetoric. Lebowitz said the explanation for Giuliani’s remarks is simple: His policies have been racist since his first election when he campaigned on a nostalgic 1950s-era platform, and this racism extended to longstanding disparate treatment of blacks and whites by the New York Police Department. "When Giuliani was the mayor, every five minutes an unarmed black guy was shot in the back. Constantly, you know, and it was always a different excuse from the cops," she said. " ‘He had something in his hand, I thought it was a gun.’ It was a candy bar. ‘He had something in his hand, I thought it was a gun.’ It was a keychain." Maher said, "Well, that hasn't changed, and that's not just New York." "In the entire time I've lived in New York, which has been many decades, not a single unarmed white person has been shot by the police," Lebowitz said. "Not one. Not one. You think the odds would be? Not one. So that is the reason they're shot, period." Lebowitz made two claims — that "every five minutes an unarmed black guy was shot in the back," and "not a single unarmed white person has been shot by the police" in the entire time Lebowitz has lived in New York. A reader asked us to hone in on the second claim, brushing off the first as hyperbole. Contacting Lebowitz Lebowitz moved to New York City from New Jersey sometime in the late 1960s. Our rough math: She was born in 1950, and this New York Times profile says she moved there after high school. So, to Lebowitz, an unarmed white person has not been shot by New York police in at least about 45 years. We reached her through representatives at the Steven Barclay Agency. Sara Bixler told PunditFact, "Fran Lebowitz tells me that to her knowledge, this is true — she meant it non-hyperbolically. She said that if she is wrong, she would like to know, of course." No simple data The difficulty in judging Lebowitz's statement is that there is no comprehensive database that details police shootings across the country, much less New York City. That means there is no go-to source that shows shootings by race and whether those shot were unarmed or armed. Reporting to the FBI is optional, and most of the country’s 18,000 law enforcement agencies choose not to report. The gap in data gained prominence after last fall’s shooting of Michael Brown by officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Mo. The New York Police Department likely can prove Lebowitz right or wrong. But the agency ignored our calls and emails spread out over more than five weeks. Our request was "under consideration" six days after the first email we sent Feb. 25. NYPD did not respond to our March 26 query for information. An early 1970s study So what information is available? We located a study of NYPD officer shootings from 1971 to 1975 by James J. Fyfe. His study, "Shots Fired," spans 700 pages and relies on access to detailed NYPD shooting incident records. Fyfe broke down the shootings by race and by weapon. More than half of the black residents who were shot by police were carrying a handgun, compared to 48 percent of Hispanics and 32 percent of whites. The white "opponents," as Fyfe calls them, were more likely to be shot while not carrying a weapon or while using physical force. Crucially for this fact-check, Fyfe's data show 56 whites were unarmed when police shot at them during those years (1971-75), and another 34 whites were shot when using physical force. Of the more than 1,800 primary opponents of police shootings during those years, 19 percent were white, 58 percent were black, and 23 percent were Hispanic. "She is simply wrong about unarmed whites ‘never’ being shot," said David Klinger, a University of Missouri St. Louis criminology professor who tracks police use of deadly force around the country. However, Fyfe’s report does include holes pivotal to our specific question. We can’t drill down on the circumstances in which the white residents ended up getting shot at by police. Racial categories are also very difficult to assess sometimes. And we can't ask Fyfe, who died in 2006. "Is a Spanish-speaking white person ‘Hispanic’ and thus non-white? Are English-speaking biracial people from immigrant backgrounds non-white?" said Candace McCoy, City University of New York criminology professor (McCoy and Fyfe were married). "New York is so incredibly diverse. It's hard to find people who are unequivocally what we consider as ‘white’ sometimes." What NYPD data says and doesn’t say NYPD has released an annual report outlining officers’ firearm discharges since 1971. That was a particularly brutal year for both shootings of cops (47 injured, 12 killed) as well as the number of people shot and killed by police (221 injured, 93 people killed). Those numbers have fallen substantially since the 1970s. In 2013, the latest year for which data is available, three officers were shot and none was killed, and officers shot 17 people and killed eight. We found several, but not all, reports online. And of the ones we found, many did not include critical racial data. The last chart in the appendix of recent reports outlines "intentional discharges" of firearms during adversarial conflicts, as well as the race and age of the person involved. Most often, this is when an officer shoots at a person armed with a gun in self-defense, though there are also categories for shootings of subjects with imitation firearms, threat or use of knives and other cutting objects, blunt instruments, or a final category called "use/threaten the use of overwhelming physical force." "Overwhelming physical force" covers times when an unarmed person physically attacks or threatens to attack an officer, such as gang assaults, pushing an officer from a roof or subway train platform, or trying to take the officer’s firearm. We compiled the following chart, filling in blanks for the number of whites shot each year and how many were unarmed if reports were available online. We could only go back to 1995. As you can see, many did not have the information we need. Year Number of whites shot Number whites unarmed 2013 2 0 2012 3 0 2011 7 0 2010 5 0 2009 0 0 2008 2 0 2007 2 unknown 2006 no race data kept 2005 no race data kept 2004 no race data kept 2003 no race data kept 2002 no race data kept 2001 no race data kept 2000 no race data kept 1999 no race data kept 1998 no race data kept 1997 26 unknown 1996 32 unknown Some observations after scouring the NYPD reports: • Whites are shot at less frequently than blacks and Hispanics. • The whites who were shot at by police were allegedly carrying a firearm, a blunt weapon, imitation gun, threatening others with weapons, or using their vehicles as weapons. • And most importantly in this quest, several years’ reports did not include information on the race of the victim. The last point was a bone of contention with the New York Civil Liberties Union, which in 2008 complained before the city council about the police not reporting the race of victims since 1998. The department was, however, reporting on the breed of dogs its officers shot. "That the department is providing more information about the dogs it is shooting at than people who are its intended targets is deeply disturbing and must be connected," the NYCLU said. We will note that these years cover some of Giuliani’s mayoral tenure from 1994 to 2001. The department has offered more descriptive accounting of officer-involved shootings in recent years after pressure from the NYCLU and media coverage. Other ideas We searched news articles from New York and found no case that explicity fits Lebowitz's criteria. We also consulted several experts on criminology and police shooting statistics looking for additional information. James Acker, a University of Albany-SUNY College of Criminal Justice professor, pointed us to a New York Daily News investigation that found in 179 officer-involved shootings, 86 percent of victims when race was known were either black or Hispanic. But we still do not know what percentage were white with certainty and whether they were armed. Fewer than one-third of the people who died were unarmed, as examined by the Daily News. Acker also suggested New York's vital statistics reports for deaths caused by legal interventions and then sorting by race/ethnicity. Using that tool, we know 15 whites were shot by police in the city from 2000 (the earliest starting point for the database) to 2012. That’s an undercount from the chart above. But we do not know whether they were armed. Contrary to Lebowitz’s broader point, Klinger notes, police violence actually fell under Giuliani. Victims in police shootings by NYPD cops fell from 90 people (29 fatals) in 1994 to 30 people in 2001 (11 fatal), Klinger said, citing his own records. D. Brian Burghart, editor and publisher of the Reno News & Review, created his own website, Fatal Encounters, to document fatal police shooting. Using his database, we found about a dozen examples of former, off-duty and current New York City police officers fatally shooting white people or killing them with their cars in accidents from pursuits or driving while intoxicated and off-duty. But most were armed with knives, guns or other weapons, or were killed during vehicle pursuits. Many showed signs of mental illness. There were no examples of an unarmed person being shot by a cop. Our ruling Lebowitz said, "Not a single unarmed white person has been shot by the police" since she has lived in New York. This was a bear of fact-check to wrestle to the ground, in part because of the lack of cooperation from the New York Police Department, in part because we were looking at a time period that spanned about 45 years, and in part because it is clear that African-Americans and Hispanics were clearly shot at by New York police much more than whites. All that said, an analysis of police data show police shot dozens of unarmed white people during the early 1970s, the early side of Lebowitz’s life in New York City. While we wish we had complete data on police shootings by each victim’s race and armed status for the 1980s on, we don’t necessarily need it to judge Lebowitz’s particular statement. It is very accurate to say blacks are shot at more often by police than whites. But that is not what Lebowitz said. She said "not a single unarmed white person has been shot," and that is not true. We rate her claim False. Note: This claim was fact-checked as part of a reward to our Kickstarter campaign to live fact-check the 2015 State of the Union. Thanks to all who contributed.

pomt-00197	"When (Ron DeSantis) was asked what cancer patients should do without health insurance, DeSantis said 'show up to the emergency room.'"	half-true	/florida/statements/2018/oct/18/andrew-gillum/florida-democrats-say-ron-desantis-wants-send-canc/	Democrats are capitalizing on Ron DeSantis’ opposition to the Affordable Care Act in an ad that portrays him as having little concern for cancer patients. "In Congress, Ron DeSantis demanded that any new health law eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions," said an ad for Andrew Gillum's campaign produced with the Florida Democratic Party. "He’d let insurance companies deny them coverage. And when he was asked what cancer patients should do without health insurance, DeSantis said 'show up to the emergency room.'" We will explain the context of the comments by DeSantis about cancer patients and the emergency room. In a related fact-check we will explain the ad’s evidence related to his stance on pre-existing conditions. DeSantis, a longtime critic of the Affordable Care Act, was first elected to Congress in 2012 and resigned in September to focus on his race for governor against Gillum. A DeSantis campaign spokesman didn’t respond for this fact-check. CNN interview The statement about the emergency room stemmed from a March 8, 2017, appearance by DeSantis on Erin Burnett’s OutFront on CNN about a House Republican plan to replace the Affordable Care Act. The show included a clip of an interview with Republican Tiffany Koehler, who found out she had cancer shortly after she lost a race for the Wisconsin State Assembly. Koehler said she could only afford chemotherapy as a result of her state’s Medicaid expansion. Burnett asked DeSantis about Koehler’s situation (the bold emphasis is ours): Burnett: "I want to start with Tiffany's story that you just heard there because of course, the GOP House plan that we've seen does roll back the Medicaid expansion. And I know you think it doesn’t quite do enough on that front. What do you say to Tiffany? I mean, she's a Republican, but, you know, she wouldn't be alive, she wouldn't be here without that Medicaid expansion and Obamacare." DeSantis: "Well, if you remember when Obamacare was enacted, there were millions of people who had their health care canceled. And so there are stories of people who had certain needs, cancer or whatnot who got pushed into policies that they didn't want, and then they didn't have the same coverage that they had because of the broken promise. So I think this law has really created a lot of different aspects. "I would say though, and people who supported Obamacare used to make this point a lot before it passed, there really is no lack of health care. If people really need it, if they show up to the emergency room, they do get care, it just gets passed on --" Burnett: "But not -- I mean, she had $1 million in cancer treatments. You're not going to get that by showing up in an emergency room." DeSantis pivoted to his opinion that the health care law isn’t sustainable. For the rest of the interview, neither DeSantis nor Burnett brought up anything about patients showing up at an emergency room. So DeSantis did make the statement that if people need care they can go to the ER, but he was speaking broadly and not only about a cancer patient. A few days later at a testy town hall over health care at Bethune-Cookman University, DeSantis addressed his emergency room comment. He said "he had conflated two ideas" and that going to the emergency room "was not the way to handle that situation," according to the Daytona Beach News-Journal. (PolitiFact was unable to find a full video of that town hall.) Because emergency rooms by law cannot turn patients away, they can become a health care provider of last resort. President Barack Obama had expressed hope that the Affordable Care Act would lower emergency room use. In 2017, we found that there was strong evidence that emergency room usage hadn’t declined much, if at all, since the law largely took effect in 2013. There’s also evidence that it has increased. Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, told PolitiFact the problem with cancer treatment in emergency rooms is the lack of continuity of care. "Many hospitals, especially public hospitals, will have clinics and similar programs to treat people in a more ongoing way," she said, "but it still tends to be a very expensive way to receive care." Our ruling A Gillum ad said, "When he was asked what cancer patients should do without health insurance, DeSantis said 'show up to the emergency room.'" What he said is not that cut and dried. DeSantis did bring up the requirement that everyone be treated in the emergency room when a CNN host asked what he would say to a cancer patient who benefited from Medicaid expansion. In context, however, he appeared to be talking more broadly about "how there really is no lack of health care." He side-stepped the direct question, for sure. But he did not straight-up say that cancer patients should seek care at the ER. At a town hall a few days later, DeSantis said "he had conflated two ideas" and that going to the emergency room "was not the way to handle that situation." We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-05764	Says Connie Mack "failed to pay his child support."	false	/florida/statements/2012/feb/29/george-lemieux/lemieux-says-connie-mack-failed-pay-his-child-supp/	Judging from his latest Web ad, George LeMieux thinks his rival for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate is a loser on par with Hollywood bad boy Charlie Sheen. The ad parodies "Two and a Half Men" -- the show Sheen infamously quit in a snit -- to target U.S. Rep. Connie Mack, whom the ad mockingly calls "Half Mack." In the ad, we see an animated "Half Mack" in a series of buffoonish outfits as the ad makes its stinging charges: "Connie the fourth took seven and a half-years to finish college. … Drunken Brawls. … Arrested. … Road rage. … His only real job in the real world? An 'events coordinator' for Hooters! "In Congress, Half Mack bounced checks, didn’t pay bills, was sued by his Yacht club, stiffed his lawyer, even failed to pay his child support." There’s a lot of claims in that ad, and viewers can find background about much of it in a Miami Herald article that examined Mack’s past. We’ll be looking at a number of these claims in the days ahead. In this item, we will tackle the serious charge that Mack "failed to pay his child support." The ad shows many notices sailing by, each stamped "urgent," "overdue," or "past due." Mack (whose real name is Cornelius Harvey McGillicuddy IV) filed for divorce from his wife Ann McGillicuddy in August 2005 in Lee County Court. On July 12, 2006, the lawyer for the congressman filed a response to his estranged wife’s motion for contempt. The document states that Mack agreed to pay $1,700 a month in temporary support to his estranged wife starting May 1, 2006. His annual congressional salary in 2005 was $162,100, the Herald reported. That payment was apparently late. When we asked LeMieux’s campaign for evidence, they referred us to a court document from Mack’s divorce posted on the Herald’s website showing a single late payment in connection with the $1,700. The court record filed by Mack’s attorney showed he transferred $400 to Ann’s account July 3 while on vacation. Once he realized he made a mistake, according to the court filing, he transferred $1,000 on July 10, $164.49 on July 11, and $135.51 on July 12, as well as $175 on July 12 to cover any returned checks. We should note that the document said "temporary support" and "temporary alimony," and not child support, though news reports from the time indicated Mack had two children ages 3 and 5. The LeMieux campaign said the money should count as child support. "Financial support of the children is part of family support, and Connie Mack did not make the payment on time," LeMieux spokeswoman Anna Nix said in an email. Mack campaign spokesman David James said this was an alimony payment -- not child support. James told PolitiFact that the divorce wasn’t final on the dates in question, and negotiations were still ongoing. "The terminology of ‘late’ is one attorney’s interpretation of the facts." We were unable to reach Mack’s ex-wife or her attorney. We did speak with Carolyn Swift, the congressman’s attorney. She said the document the Herald posted specifically referred to the $1,700 that was agreed upon for temporary alimony, in addition to him paying other expenses, including the mortgage on their Virginia residence. Swift sent us a copy of a May 2006 agreed-upon order that described the $1,700 payment as "temporary alimony." The marital settlement agreement filed in late July said that the congressman would pay the mortgage in lieu of child support until the home was sold, Swift said. An addendum in 2007 set child support at $1,645 a month. Our ruling LeMieux’s ad said that Mack "failed to pay his child support," and the visuals of multiple "past due" notices suggest a pattern. LeMieux can’t prove that charge, though. Instead, LeMieux points to a court document that showed Mack was once 12 days late in paying for part of a $1,700 "temporary alimony" payment. LeMieux’s campaign argued that Mack’s late alimony payment could have been used to pay for their children’s expenses. We think saying that Mack "failed" to pay his child support is quite a stretch. It’s based on a single partial late payment of less than two weeks, and the payment was classified as alimony by the courts. We rate this claim False.

pomt-02489	Says David Jolly "supports privatizing Social Security."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/feb/17/florida-democratic-party/democrats-say-david-jolly-david-jolly-supports-pri/	Issues affecting seniors continue to drive a lot of the attack ads in the race to fill the seat held by the late U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young. One of the more persistent claims lately has been Democratic accusations that David Jolly wants to fundamentally change Social Security. In a robocall that began targeting Pinellas County’s independent seniors on Feb. 6, 2014, the Florida Democratic Party reinforces the attack. "Lobbyist Jolly also supports privatizing Social Security, which could force seniors to gamble with their retirement on the stock market, and Jolly even praised the Ryan Budget that turns Medicare into a costly voucher program," a woman’s voice says during the call. We’ve been over claims about Jolly’s actions on Medicare and the Ryan budget before, but does he want to privatize Social Security? This sound bite ends up being quite a mouthful. Securing Jolly’s platform Former congressional aide-turned-lobbyist Jolly has faced repeated attacks over his past advocacy of other issues before. Part of the evidence for this claim is that one of his old clients, Free Enterprise Nation, was run by a man named James MacDougald. Jolly in 2009 lobbied U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., for issues relating to Medicare and Social Security -- namely that future years of debt aren’t readily apparent to taxpayers, according to the Republican candidate. He listed only "Social Security Reform" as one of the topics of the meeting on a lobbying disclosure form. His campaign said he was "critical of the Ryan budget" in the meeting with the congressman. Ryan’s budget plans over the years called for revamping the Social Security Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance program by allowing workers younger than 55 to divert some of their contributions from Social Security to voluntary personal savings accounts. The money in the accounts would be invested, overseen by the government, instead of paying for current retiree benefits. MacDougald has favored a similar approach, calling for a "defined contribution" plan for anyone younger than 50. That means the government would make a set contribution to workers, who then would have investment options. (MacDougald is now Jolly’s campaign finance co-chairman.) Jolly has said he doesn’t support this idea, but "anybody that has an intellectually honest conversation knows we have to have long-term entitlement reform in order to balance the budget." He told the Tampa Bay Times that in any such discussion, in the newspaper’s paraphrasing, "everything should be on the table, including private accounts in which workers make their own investment decisions, as well as the important role of Social Security as a safety net." Democrats have subsequently used the wording as proof Jolly supports privatization. "David Jolly has been very clear on his position that he supports preserving Social Security," campaign spokeswoman Sarah Bascom said in a statement. "In fact, that is one of the reasons he is on record saying he would not have voted for the Ryan budget because of certain changes to the Social Security program." Democrats are making hay about the fact that Jolly said "there was a lot of good in the Ryan budget" during the Dec. 8, 2013, edition of Bay News 9’s Political Connections. That portion of the quote doesn’t tell the whole story, however. "I think we have to be careful on the Ryan budget for a couple of reasons," he said on the show. "Entitlement programs — Social Security, Medicare — we know what that means to the community here. I have said from the very beginning, we have to protect the promises that have been made, to everybody." When pressed about whether he would have voted for the budget proposal with House Republicans, Jolly said he "would have to examine the details of the Ryan plan." He has also referred to his position in a Feb. 3, 2014, interview on Tampa Bay TV station WFLA. "On Social Security and Medicare, I came out very early, in a Republican primary, full of Republican conservative voters, and suggested one, I would have voted against the Ryan plan," he said. "And two, I believe we do have to protect benefits not just for current beneficiaries, but for those who have already vested into the program as a result of working 40 quarters." A quarter of coverage is a period of time based on a worker’s total wages or income over the year. A maximum of four quarters can be earned per year, and 40 quarters must be earned to become fully vested (or "fully insured," as the Social Security Administration calls it) for retirement benefits. That means a worker would have to put in a minimum of 10 years in the employment pool to qualify for full benefits, if they earned all four quarters in a year. So generally speaking, Jolly is saying he wants to particularly protect those who have worked for 10 years, while looking at changes for young workers. Jolly told the Tampa Bay Times editorial board in a Dec. 9, 2013, meeting before the primary that he supported keeping Social Security and Medicare the same except for the youngest workers. Jolly referred to similar phrasing in a Feb. 3 debate with Democratic opponent Alex Sink and Libertarian hopeful Lucas Overby, adding "long-term entitlement reform is the only way to reach a balanced budget." Our ruling Democrats say Jolly "supports privatizing Social Security," using a paraphrased statement that private accounts should be on the table in discussing future reforms. They also point to the fact Jolly had a meeting with Ryan to discuss the program. Jolly says he’s been very clear where he stands on Social Security, but we don’t think it’s all that apparent. Saying private accounts should be an option doesn’t denote advocacy, but rather a willingness to explore options. Which option Jolly favors isn’t so clear, beyond setting some kind of benefit guarantee for people who have already qualified for Social Security or are currently receiving payments. He hasn’t said whether private accounts were at the top of his list of potential fixes, only that they should be considered. Democrats are attempting to make it sound like he is 100 percent behind the idea, but don’t offer any proof beyond a paraphrased statement. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-04952	Says he has seen Border Patrol signs near the Mexico border in English, Spanish and Chinese.	true	/texas/statements/2012/jul/26/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-says-hes-seen-border-patrol-signs-e/	Republican U.S. Senate hopeful David Dewhurst, saying the U.S.-Mexico border is dangerously porous, said in a July 17, 2012, debate in Dallas that he has even witnessed suspicious signs. "I’ve seen the Border Patrol signs that are now in English, Spanish and Chinese," Dewhurst said in the debate with Ted Cruz, his opponent. Six days later, Dewhurst similarly referred to such signs in the pair’s last debate before the July 31, 2012, primary runoff. Border signs in English and Spanish, sure. But Chinese? Dewhurst’s camp did not respond to our inquiry about this. But Daniel Milian, a Border Patrol supervisor in the agency’s Rio Grande Valley sector, told us such signs are posted next to "rescue beacon" towers arrayed in the rough brush country that covers much of the Texas-Mexico border region. In a telephone interview, Milian said the towers, 40- to 50-feet tall, are visible from great distances, the idea being that border crossers in danger of falling ill or dying spot them and come close. He said the signs instruct individuals to press a button to summon authorities. And, Milian said, the signs are in English, Spanish and Mandarin, which is the group of dialects most widely spoken in China. The point, Milian said, is to deliver the message in ways that border crossers can understand. He said Mandarin was chosen because immigrants from China are second to immigrants from Spanish-speaking countries among border-crossers apprehended by the Border Patrol. How exactly did this transpire? In a March 3, 2009, Border Patrol press release, the Rio Grande Valley sector said it was deploying two beacons in preparation for summer heat and to "reduce the possibility of heat-related injuries and death." The release says the beacons were "designed for deployment to remote areas along the border and to provide people, who perceive themselves to be in a life-threatening situation, with a mechanism for summoning assistance." "The beacons will be embedded in established illegal alien and smuggling routes and are designed to provide a means by which persons in distress may locate, activate and summon emergency assistance," the 2009 release says. The release quotes Ronald Citiello, chief patrol agent in Falfurrias, as saying: "We work very hard to ensure that our borders are secure and safe, but many lives are still lost as a result of people not fully comprehending the inherent dangers of illegally crossing through the remote areas and not being aware of how quickly heat related distress can occur. More recently, an April 27, 2012, Border Patrol press release stating that Border Patrol agents at the agency’s Falfurrias station, which is in Brooks County, saved the lives of two illegal immigrants that day after the pair activated a beacon. The release says the Border Patrol has six rescue beacons "strategically placed on ranches throughout the area Since Oct. 1, 2011, the release says, Border Patrol agents in the region had "saved the lives of more than 120" illegal immigrants, "whose lives were in jeopardy due to a variety of circumstances. Nationally, Border Patrol officers apprehended about 340,000 illegal residents through the latest federal fiscal year, from October 2010 through September 2011, the agency says, including nearly 126,000 along or near the Texas-Mexico border. We failed to determine how many of the apprehended individuals were Chinese. But a July 2011 "fact sheet" from the Department of Homeland Security states that nationally, immigrants from Spanish-speaking countries comprised more than 95 percent of Border Patrol apprehensions over the five fiscal years through September 2010 with immigrants from China accounting for 0.3 percent or fewer of each year’s apprehensions. In the year running through September 2010, 1,157 apprehended individuals were of Chinese nationality. Our ruling While we did not learn where Dewhurst saw the signs, his statement rates True.

pomt-03460	"The United States has never stood by and seen innocent people slaughtered to the extent that's happening in Syria."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/18/saxby-chambliss/saxby-chambliss-says-us-has-never-stood-and-seen-i/	Last week, the United States announced that it was convinced that the Syrian regime led by Bashar al-Assad had used chemical weapons, thus crossing a line set by President Barack Obama that would trigger U.S. involvement in the three-year-long rebellion and resulting civil war. On CNN’s The Situation Room, Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., made the case for U.S. involvement in Syria. Chambliss serves as vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. "The United States has never stood by and seen innocent people slaughtered to the extent that's happening in Syria," Chambliss said. "The United States does not need to be the world's policeman, but the United States does need to step in when tyrants like this, really, in a very militant way, kill innocent people on a regular basis." We wondered: Is there a precedent for the United States failing to intervene in the slaughter of innocents on a scale as large as, or larger than, the conflict in Syria? The first part of answering this question is to determine how many people have been killed in Syria. As in the case of most conflicts, estimating the number of deaths tends to be imprecise. However, an office of the United Nations reported this month that the death toll in Syria reached at least 93,000 by the end of April. Of course, the United States has combated, in one way or another, cases of mass civilian deaths, including World War II Japan, North Korea during the Korean War, the former Yugoslavia, Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, and Taliban-led Afghanistan. A spokeswoman for Chambliss said the senator was referring to "tragedies like Bosnia, where the United States had full knowledge of the abuses occurring, and had the ability and resources to intervene. The United States now has confirmation that Assad used chemical weapons on his own people, and so appropriate action must be taken." But there are numerous examples in which the U.S. had initelligence about mass killings and chose not to intervene. The most obvious example of a genocide not directly challenged by the United States, of course, is the Holocaust. "You need search no further" to debunk Chambliss’ comment than the genocide of European Jewry, said Debórah Dwork, director of the Strassler Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies at Clark University. All told, Nazi Germany "deliberately killed about 11 million noncombatants, a figure that rises to more than 12 million if foreseeable deaths from deportation, hunger, and sentences in concentration camps are included," Timothy Snyder, a Yale historian, has written. The United States fought Nazi Germany in World War II, of course. The U.S. government had a pretty good idea what was going on by at least April 1943, when the U.S. and the United Kingdom called a conference in Bermuda to discuss refugees amid growing public urgings to save Jewish populations in Europe, Dwork said. But the parties to the conference essentially sidestepped the question, and diverting military assets to directly challenge the infrastructure of the Holocaust remained off the Allies’ agenda until the war ended in 1945. There are other examples -- lots of them. While politics and historical uncertainty makes it impossible to create a perfect list, there are quite a few examples that would seem to undercut Chambliss’ claim. • Communist China. While the United States was hardly friendly toward Mao Zedong’s China prior to President Richard Nixon’s rapprochement in the 1970s, the U.S. didn’t directly intervene when millions in China were killed in such government programs as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. Frank Dikötter, a Hong Kong-based historian, told the British newspaper The Independent that in just the four-year period between 1958 and 1962, at least 45 million people were worked, starved or beaten to death. Measuring a longer period, the death toll would surely be higher. • The Soviet Union. As for the United States’ World War II ally, Snyder estimates that a variety of policies under Josef Stalin -- including the elimination of relatively prosperous peasants known as "kulaks," ethnic cleansing, preventable famine and political purges -- resulted in the deliberate killing of 6 million noncombatants and the preventable deaths of an additional 3 million. • Cambodia. Dictator Pol Pot, leader of the Khmer Rouge, is believed to have killed approximately 2 million people between 1975 and 1979 through execution, starvation and disease. • The Armenian genocide. The widespread killing of Armenians in the Ottoman empire starting in 1915 is hotly contested historical turf between Armenians and present-day Turks, but the University of Minnesota’s Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies has estimated that a total of 1.5 million Armenians died over the course of several years. • Ethiopia. Ethiopian dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam is blamed for as many as 500,000 deaths as a result of his "red terror" political campaign in 1977 and 1978, according to Amnesty International. A subsequent famine, for which he is at least partially blamed, claimed the lives of an estimated 1 million. • Biafra. From 1967 to 1970, Nigeria went to war against the breakaway state of Biafra. The war, combined with a resulting famine, may have claimed 1 million people. • Rwanda. In just 100 days, perhaps 1 million ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed in the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Earlier this year, former President Bill Clinton told CNBC that if his own administration had acted sooner, 300,000 lives might have been saved -- an enormous regret for the former president that led to the creation of his nonprofit foundation. "If we'd gone in sooner, I believe we could have saved at least a third of the lives that were lost," he said in the interview. "It had an enduring impact on me." • Uganda. During his rule from 1971 to 1979, Ugandan dictator Idi Amin is blamed for between 300,000 and 500,000 deaths. • Darfur. Over the course of a decade, Sudanese government attacks in the southwestern region of Darfur led to the deaths of an estimated 300,000 people. • Liberia. Liberian Dictator Charles Taylor and the wars he started are blamed for the deaths of more than 300,000 people. • Bangladesh. The war that led to the creation of Bangladesh in 1971 -- previously a geographically isolated portion of Pakistan -- led to the deaths of 269,000 people, according to a study in the British Medical Journal. • Burundi. Ethnic violence starting in 1993 led to the deaths of about 200,000 people in Burundi. All in all, Chambliss’ statement "is clearly incorrect," said Herbert Hirsch, a political scientist who specializes in genocide at Virginia Commonwealth University. Indeed, the list above is not comprehensive. University of Hawaii political scientist R.J. Rummel lists no fewer than 219 cases between 1900 and 1987. "While I definitely do not endorse Rummel’s entire catalog, his basic point is surely sound: Government-led or government-caused slaughter has been a good deal more lethal than traditional state-on-state war," said Ted R. Bromund, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation. "I would therefore not be able to agree with Sen. Chambliss's statement." Bromund and Brookings Institution senior fellow Michael O’Hanlon did agree, however, that the decision on whether to intervene in Syria needs to be made on its own merits, not decided by adherence to the United States’ track record. "There are many cases where we’ve stood by with much larger death tolls," O’Hanlon said. "But that doesn’t really justify inaction in Syria." Then again, "adopting a rule to intervene against all and any regime that kills innocents on a regular basis would mean getting involved in numerous countries around the globe," said Robert Gellately, a historian at Florida State University. "Rushing into a hot conflict like the one in Syria does not appear to be prudent at this stage." Our ruling Chambliss said, "The United States has never stood by and seen innocent people slaughtered to the extent that's happening in Syria." That claim is undercut by myriad examples in which more than 100,000 civilians were killed yet the United States did not take direct and significant action. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-08995	Says Democratic opponent is "too Republican to stand up for us."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2010/jul/14/vincent-fort/fort-contends-opponet-republican-democratic-clothi/	It doesn’t get much nastier than this in Fulton County politics. State Sen. Vincent Fort (D-Atlanta) finds himself under a withering political assault from upstart Graham Balch, a 36-year-old biology teacher at Grady High School, a former Peace Corps volunteer, a Barack Obama supporter and a man who has the backing of some true heavyweights in the Atlanta business community. A renegade in the state Legislature who has never shied away from confrontation, Fort now finds himself in a fierce, under-the-radar firefight to save the District 39 Senate job he has held for 14 years. It just might be the biggest battle in Georgia this year for a legislative seat held by an incumbent. But there have been no debates or even joint appearances by Fort and Balch. This fight to the finish is being played out in direct-mail broadsides and so-called robo attacks (recorded telephone calls). Senate District 39 runs from East Point in the south up through Midtown and into Buckhead. It includes portions of southwest Atlanta. It’s a diverse district with a majority black (62 percent) population. It contains some of Atlanta’s richest and poorest neighborhoods. And it’s always been a sure win for Democrats. That will be the case again this election cycle. Fort and Balch are the only candidates running. And they have both signed up as Democrats. But there’s a twist, at least according to Fort. The veteran politician and college history professor contends Balch is not much of a Democrat at all. In a mailer sent to District 39 residents, and in subsequent media interviews, Fort argued that Balch is little more than a Republican masquerading as a Democrat. That’s a politically incendiary charge in District 39. One Fort mailer has a photo of Balch on the front. Below are photos of three elephants doing tricks with GOP stickers on their bodies. The headline reads: "How Republican is Graham Balch? The headline on the other side reads: "Graham Balch. Too Republican to stand up for us." It’s a point Fort has continued to hammer home to supporters and reporters. "He’s a Republican in Democratic clothing," Fort said in an interview with PolitiFact Georgia. Rubbish, Balch said. He accused Fort of twisting the facts to smear him. "I am 100 percent a Democrat, and I’m very proud of that." Balch said. But is Fort correct? Or is the veteran lawmaker and political firebrand simply playing the party card to discredit the only real challenger he has faced in more than a decade? Fort stands by his mailer. "He worked for a Republican congressman and he voted in the Republican primary," Fort said. "That makes him a Republican." Balch agreed with Fort that he did intern for a Republican congressman while working on his thesis about the GOP’s impact on environmental policy. He interned for then U.S. Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, a moderate Republican from New York known for his environmental activism. And Balch said he did vote in the 2000 and 2004 GOP primaries in Pennsylvania, where he lived at the time. But he did so, Balch said, to cast a write-in protest vote against George W. Bush. Georgia voters, unlike those in Pennsylvania, do not register by political party. "I have done some protest votes against Bush because I think he stole the 2000 election (both in winning the Republican nomination and the general election) with dirty politics, and because I consider him the worst president in U.S. history," Balch said. "That protest vote is why I am listed that way in Pennsylvania." A review of voting records in Pennsylvania shows Balch is listed as "Republican" and "inactive." There is no independent way to determine why Balch voted in the Pennsylvania GOP primary. So PolitiFact Georgia sought more recent records. We went to VoteBuilder, which touts itself as a "partnership between the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Party of Georgia." It’s an effort to identify and target people who consistently vote for Democrats. VoteBuilder gives Balch an 83 percent rating as a Democrat. It places him in its "strong Democrats" category. Balch is also an elected member of the Fulton County Democratic Party, according to its Web site. He holds Seat 2 in House District 59. Fort is unimpressed. "A corpse could get elected to that position," Fort said. "It’s a social club." A check of financial contribution records also shows Balch has given money to Georgia Win List, a group that backs female Democratic candidates. And he specifically contributed to the campaign of state Rep. Margaret Kaiser, a Democrat from Atlanta. There was no indication he has ever contributed to Republican candidates. The Fort-Balch race has taken on some of the overtones of last year’s slugfest between Kasim Reed and Mary Norwood for mayor of Atlanta. That race was nonpartisan, but Reed’s camp accused Norwood of being too cozy with Republicans. Reed narrowly won the hard-fought contest. "He’s saying to himself, ‘Hey, this worked for Kasim Reed against Mary Norwood, so let’s try it again,’ " Balch said in a telephone interview with PolitiFact Georgia. Reed has endorsed Fort and held a fund-raiser for him, spokeswoman Sonji Dade said. Fort was a staunch supporter of Reed in the mayoral race. Fort has repeatedly said that Balch’s contributors are Republican. But a check of those records indicates they come from both political camps, many of them with strong ties to the business community. Fort accuses the business community of trying to run him out of office because of his aggressive stand against the privatization of Grady Memorial Hospital. He was a frequent vocal critic of the move. And Fort was even hauled away in handcuffs after he disrupted one Grady board meeting. Contributors to Balch’s campaign include Metro Chamber of Commerce President Sam Williams, former Cousins Properties CEO Tom Bell and Lisa Borders, a former president of the Atlanta City Council who is now president of the Grady Foundation. "The good ol’ boys are out to get me," Fort said during a recent telephone interview with PolitiFact Georgia. Fort would have been correct if he had said Balch is strongly backed by Atlanta’s business community. But the state senator appears to be on shaky ground accusing his opponent of being a Republican. We give Fort a Barely True on this one. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09737	"The Senate Finance Committee approved a reform proposal that has both Democratic and Republican support."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/19/barack-obama/health-care-reform-bipartsian/	In his weekly address, President Barack Obama warned health insurance companies not to derail health care reform, and he praised the progress Congress has already made. Obama said a broad coalition of supporters including "doctors and nurses, workers and businesses, hospitals and even drug companies — folks who represent different parties and perspectives, including leading Democrats and many leading Republicans" were pushing reform forward. "Just this week, the Senate Finance Committee approved a reform proposal that has both Democratic and Republican support," he said. It was the last statement that caught our attention. Leaders of the majority party often boast about bipartisan support when in fact they have only a handful of votes from the minority. But in this case, Obama so far has just one Republican in the Senate. The Senate Finance Committee voted to approve a version of the health care overhaul on a vote of 14-9 on Oct. 13. Sen. Olympia Snowe, a Republican from Maine, voted with the Democrats. Every other Republican on the committee opposed the measure. Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican member on the committee, called the measure partisan and deeply flawed. So Obama is technically correct that the proposal had "Democratic and Republican support." But he didn't mention that it got only one Republican vote, which meant the nine other GOP senators voted against it. That's not exactly a robust example of bipartisanship. So we rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-06790	"The governor having a meeting ... isn't covered by the open meetings act."	true	/georgia/statements/2011/aug/16/sam-olens/olens-governor-isnt-covered-open-meetings-laws/	For a few brief minutes, a breakfast meeting featuring Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens became a grievance-fest. In May, Gov. Nathan Deal used Georgia State Patrol troopers to block a Fox 5 reporter from a news conference where Deal signed a controversial immigration bill into law. The station had just aired a story questioning his daughter-in-law’s role in raising money for the governor’s campaign. Three months later, members of the Atlanta Press Club, which sponsored the breakfast, were still angry, and they pelted the state’s top lawyer with questions. One asked whether it was legal for Deal to use troopers to keep reporters from a news conference. "Well, time for me to go home now," Olens quipped. He continued: "The question presented from a legal context is whether the state’s open meetings act precluded that activity. And the answer is no. The answer is the governor having a meeting isn’t, frankly, subject to the open meetings act," Olens said. "It’s the governor, it’s one person, it’s not a board," he said. "So if you literally look to the wording of the act it doesn’t relate to that kind of activity." The most powerful elected official in the state isn’t covered by state open meetings law? We thought this claim was worth a second look. First, a word about open meetings. These laws are the reason why any citizen can pull up a chair at a county commission meeting and watch elected officials debate whether they should let developers build a new shopping center or ban residents from owning pit bulls. This scrutiny is supposed to keep politicians honest. When he took office, Olens said he would push for reforms that would strengthen open meetings and records laws. A hearing on the proposed changes is scheduled for Aug. 30 at the state Capitol. Now back to Olens’ claim that "the governor having a meeting isn’t, frankly, subject to the open meetings act." The state Attorney General’s Office pointed us to Title 50, Chapter 14 of Georgia’s open records law. We took a good look. The law says that gatherings of a quorum of the members of a governing body must be open to the public and announced at least 24 hours in advance. Agencies must make agendas available to the public before the meeting and release minutes within two business days afterward. The statute says state departments, agencies, boards, commissions, public corporations and authorities, counties, municipal corporations, school districts, and a host of other bodies are covered by the law. But it doesn’t say a thing about the governor. The law doesn’t apply to governors, said Hollie Manheimer, executive director of the Georgia First Amendment Foundation "Mr. Olens' interpretation is correct," Manheimer said. This is not to say that the governor can meet up with anyone in private, Manheimer said. If he meets with any of the bodies mentioned in the state’s open meetings law, those public officials would have to comply with that law. And the governor can choose to abide by the law, even though he’s not technically subject to it. State and federal statutes often protect or exempt chief executives from open meetings law, said Mark Caramanica, an expert on freedom of information laws at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. For instance, he said, a White House Cabinet meeting is closed to the public. David Hudson, an Augusta attorney who is counsel for the Georgia Press Association, said that Georgia law was drafted this way decades ago because the priority was to ensure boards that have the authority to vote, act on and implement public policies would conduct their business publicly. A governor, as a single person, does not have this kind of power, Hudson said. It’s worth noting that the Georgia Legislature is exempt from open meetings law, too, thanks to the 1975 state Supreme Court decision Coggin v. Davey. Members of the media sued to complain that they were excluded from a General Assembly committee meeting, but legislators argued they weren’t covered by the open meetings law. The General Assembly won. So there you have it. Of all the elected officials covered by Georgia’s open meetings laws, Nathan Deal isn’t one of them. We rule Olen’s claim True.

pomt-07911	"Gov. Scott Walker and the Republican-controlled state legislature have added over $140 million in new special interest spending"	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/01/one-wisconsin-now/one-wisconsin-now-says-scott-walker-and-legislatur/	With his first "state of the state" address the night of Feb. 1, 2011, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker likely will tout some of his early legislative victories. Among them: Three tax breaks worth an estimated $140 million. But one of Walker’s political antagonists, Madison-based One Wisconsin Now, has slammed the three bills. In a Jan. 28, 2011, news release, the liberal advocacy group said: "Gov. Scott Walker and the Republican-controlled state legislature have added over $140 million in new special interest spending." So, which is it? Tax cuts or spending? We know that state government folks are pretty crafty. But is it really possible for them to spend money they’ve decided not to tax in the first place? One Wisconsin Now’s statement cites three of the measures taken up by lawmakers since Walker called them into special session just hours after being inaugurated on Jan. 3, 2011. Here’s a look at each of the bills and their financial impact as estimated by the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the Legislature’s non-partisan research agency. Economic development tax credit Signed into law Jan. 31, 2011, this bill increases the state’s economic development tax credit fund to $98.1 million, up from $73.1 million. The fund provides a tax credit for job creation, capital investment or related activity. The additional $25 million in credits is not expected to be claimed during the 2011-2013 biennium. So, if employers create new jobs and claim the credits, they would pay less in taxes to the state. No spending would be involved. Health Savings Account deduction Also signed into law, this measure allows people to deduct contributions they make to Health Savings Accounts from their state income taxes, as they can from their federal income taxes. Nearly every other state already allows this. The deductions will reduce state revenue by an estimated $20.7 million in 2011-2012 and $27.3 million in 2012-2013. Tax deduction for creating jobs Under this bill, which is awaiting Walker’s signature, employers would receive a tax deduction for each job they create. They would pay an estimated $33.5 million less per year in income and franchise taxes. In other words, the bill doesn’t result in any spending, but the state would take in less tax money. See a pattern here? The bills in question don’t create any expenditures -- those are done in budget bills, which Walker has yet to introduce. But they do mean the state will take in less money. One Wisconsin Now says they apply to "special interests." They may be targeted for specific purposes, but they also hit a wide range of people, including small business owners and any working person who has an HSA. We asked Scot Ross, One Wisconsin Now’s executive director, how his organization could say the state would be spending $140 million when the effect of the three bills would be that the state would have $140 million less to spend. His reply: "When money would otherwise be in the treasury which is no longer going to be there as a result of legislative action, that is the definition of spending." Actually, it’s just the Legislature making the treasury smaller. But we decided to ask the question again. Ross: "If no action had been taken, this money would have been in the treasury. It will now no longer be in the treasury. We feel that is a form of spending." Hmmm. Ross is no dummy. He has a B.A. from the University of Pittsburgh and an M.A. from George Washington University, according to a political bio. He’s worked for a number of Democratic politicos, including Wisconsin congressman Ron Kind. He even worked as a journalist. And Ross isn’t alone with his spending notion. David Riemer, who was budget director under Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, said the concept of a "tax expenditure" dates back some 50 years to Stanley Surrey, an assistant U.S. treasury secretary. The idea, Riemer said, is that tax breaks with a particular purpose that could be accomplished by direct spending should be considered expenditures. "Their way of viewing this," Riemer said of One Wisconsin Now, "is a legitimate, honestly grounded approach. But there’s also legitimate arguments on the other side." OK, let’s go to the other side. George Lightbourn, who was secretary of administration under two Republican Wisconsin governors, said that what One Wisconsin Now is claiming is "ridiculous" -- "there’s nothing being spent, there’s not an appropriation being made." "From a political standpoint, I could see where you’d make that argument," Lightbourn said, referring to One Wisconsin Now. "But it wouldn’t hold water with the accountants." Or with the average taxpayer. We decided to try Ross a third time. This time, he tried to make his case by pointing out that Walker had described the federal stimulus bill as spending, even though the bill included tax cuts. Tax cuts and credits did make up about one-third of the $862 billion stimulus-- but two-thirds was spending. Three strikes is enough. One Wisconsin Now called $140 million in state tax breaks "spending." It’s estimated that the three bills in question would bring in $140 million less to state coffers. But that’s not spending. You can’t spend what you don’t have. We rate the statement Pants on Fire. Update: The day this PolitiFact item, One Wisconsin Now executive director Scot Ross modified the way he described the three tax break bills. Rather than calling them spending, he said in a news release issued by the liberal Citizen Action of Wisconsin that the bills are "deficit-hiking corporate giveaways."

pomt-13417	"I never said" that Muslims would be subject to profiling under his policies.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/21/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-he-never-called-profiling-muslim/	During an interview with Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly, Donald Trump pleaded innocence when asked whether he supports profiling Muslims as a way of preventing terrorism. O’Reilly asked Trump, "When you say that you're going to profile certain Muslims, are you ever worried that the peaceful Muslims, and there are millions of American … are you worried that sometimes when you say these things, (that) peaceful Muslims will be the victim of backlash, the victim of people just lumping everybody into the terror jar?" Trump responded, "Well, first of all, I never said that they were Muslims. You did. You told me Muslims. I didn't say that. I am saying ... people that maybe look suspicious. I didn't say they were Muslims." Is it true that Trump didn’t suggest profiling Muslims as a security measure? We checked Trump’s past comments and concluded that he’s correct only in the narrowest sense. The O’Reilly interview The strictest way to interpret Trump’s comment is that he only denied saying those words in O’Reilly’s interview. But even this limited claim has some problems. Earlier in the interview, O’Reilly had asked, "You want to profile Arab or Muslim men. How would that work?" Trump responded, "Well, we have no choice. Look, Israel does it. And Israel does it very successfully." This wasn’t the first interview in which Trump had accepted a question premised on the idea that he wants to profile Muslims. In a June 19, 2016, interview with John Dickerson on CBS’ Face the Nation, Dickerson asked, "Are you talking about increasing profiling of Muslims in America?" Trump responded, "Well, I think profiling is something that we're going to have to start thinking about as a country. And other countries do it. And you look at Israel and you look at others, and they do it. And they do it successfully. And I hate the concept of profiling. But we have to start using common sense, and we have to use our heads." Previous statements A more common pattern we found in Trump’s past comments was to talk explicitly about the specific security measures he would consider for Muslims, but without using the word "profiling." A good example is surveillance of mosques, which seems like an obvious case of a policy that targets a security procedure to people of a specific religion. For instance, in an interview on MSNBC’s Morning Joe on Nov. 16, 2015, Trump was asked about shutting down mosques. "Well, I would hate to do it, but it's something you're going to have to strongly consider." He repeated the call in another appearance that day, saying, "You're going to have to watch and study the mosques, because a lot of talk is going on at the mosques." He echoed this call five days later in remarks at a rally in Birmingham, Ala., saying, "I want surveillance of certain mosques if that's okay. We've had it before." And on two more recent occasions, he revived the call for mosque surveillance. One came on June 13, 2016, in comments on Fox & Friends: "We have to be very strong in terms of looking at the mosques, you know, which a lot of people say, 'Oh, we don't want to do that. We don't want to do that.' We're beyond that." The other came in the interview we cited earlier with John Dickerson on June 19, 2016. Dickerson asked, "And you said you would check respectfully the mosques. How do you respectfully check a mosque?" "Well, you do as they used to do in New York, prior to this mayor dismantling," Trump said. "By the way, if you go to France right now, they're doing it in France. In fact, in some instances, they are closing down mosques. People don't want to talk about it. People aren't talking about it. But look at what they're doing in France. They are actually closing down mosques." Then there was the statement from the campaign on "preventing Muslim immigration," personally signed by Trump on Dec. 7, 2015. "Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on," the statement said in part. We should note that we found one case in which Trump expressed caution about a kind of special security treatment for Muslims -- access to guns and ammunition. In the interview with CBS’ Dickerson, the host asked Trump, "When you talk about political correctness, should a Muslim buying ammunition and weapons get extra scrutiny?" Trump answered, "I don't know about that." The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Our ruling Trump told O’Reilly that he "never said" Muslims would be subject to profiling under his policies. On two occasions -- including once earlier in the same O’Reilly interview -- a questioner asked him about his proposal to profile Muslims, and Trump did not object to that description. He has also repeatedly suggested other types of security policies that would specifically target Muslims, including mosque surveillance and an ban on Muslims entering the United States. The statement is not accurate, so we rate it False.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-09-21T15:33:16	2016-09-19	['None']
pomt-03785	Says "$1,100 of the tuition paid by every Oregon university student annually goes just to pay the costs of PERS."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2013/mar/29/dennis-richardson/does-1100-tuition-paid-every-oregon-university-stu/	PolitiFact Oregon is no stranger to claims about just how much the Public Employees Retirement System drives state spending. Not too long ago, we checked into Gov. John Kitzhaber’s claim that half of the $1,000 per student increase in spending in primary and secondary education in the next biennium was due to the retirement costs. (The statement was true.) So when fiscal conservative Rep. Dennis Richardson, R-Central Point, made his own retirement system claim, our ears perked right up. In a newsletter to constituents, Richardson noted that "$1,100 of the tuition paid by every Oregon university student annually goes just to pay the costs of PERS." The representative's source was a presentation by Jay Kenton, the Oregon University System’s vice chancellor for finance and administration. Kenton had given a presentation on what drives the cost of higher education. Naturally, retirement and health care costs are a big piece of the equation. Essentially what Kenton had done was to take the total retirement costs of employees -- both faculty and staff -- paid in part from tuition. He then prorated the total by actual percentage of it paid with tuition dollars. After all that math, he found that the projected share of an individual student’s annual tuition going toward university staff retirement benefits for the 2012-13 year was $849. That’s actually about on par for what it was the previous year, too. So how did Richardson get the $1,100 figure? Well, that’s where Kenton’s projections put the figure for the 2013-14 school year, should Kitzhaber’s proposed reforms not be enacted. With the technical bits out of the way, we went back to Richardson’s statement. He said that "$1,100 of the tuition paid by every Oregon university student annually goes just to pay the costs of PERS." He’s right, but only if the projections come to pass. In other words, we may get there, but we haven’t yet. As it is now, that figure is closer to $850. It’s still high, to be sure, but it’s about $250 less than the figure Richardson is using. The ruling: Richardson’s statement reads as if we’ve been at the $1,100 mark for a while, when in truth we haven’t actually gotten there. If the Legislature passes significant reforms this year -- a big if -- we may never get there. If we were writing a newsletter, we’d have gone with the most recent solid figure from the 2011-12 school year, which is about $850. Or, we would have made it clearer that the $1,100 was an extrapolation, a prediction. Richardson did neither. Though his claim is accurate, it requires additional information. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Dennis Richardson	None	None	None	2013-03-29T14:27:04	2013-03-15	['Oregon']
pomt-11121	"I left the White House $16 million in debt."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jun/05/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-16-million-debt-monica-lewinsky/	Asked about his past in the context of the #MeToo movement, former President Bill Clinton said he did the right thing in the aftermath of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and claimed he didn’t go unpunished thanks to the red ink that followed. "I felt terrible then, and I came to grips with it," Clinton said during an NBC News interview. "Did you ever apologize to her?" Craig Melvin asked. "Yes," Clinton said, following some hesitation. "And nobody believes that I got out of that for free. I left the White House $16 million in debt. But you typically have ignored gaping facts in describing this, and I bet you don’t even know this. This was litigated 20 years ago." But Clinton didn’t have his own facts straight. Later in the interview, Clinton admitted he never talked to Lewinsky in the aftermath of the affair. He only apologized publicly, and to a long list of people involved. As for his claim about leaving the White House with $16 million in debt, that’s an exaggeration. We previously looked at a claim by Hillary Clinton that she and Bill came out of the White House "dead broke." A closer look at Clinton’s 2001 financial disclosure form for the Senate shows they possibly had more liabilities than assets, but it doesn’t show that conclusively. Bill Clinton’s claim is different, however. He did not clarify whether he was talking about net or gross debt, or how exactly those debts came to be. He did suggest that the legal fees played an important role. So we took another look at Hillary Clinton’s 2001 Senate financial disclosure form, which gives us a public look into hers and her husband’s finances. Hillary Clinton reported that legal debt for the Clintons and former staff members came to a minimum of $1.75 million and maximum of $6.5 million. Bill Clinton’s spokesman, Angel Ureña, pointed us to a Washington Post report from 2007 that said the Clintons "left the White House with an estimated $12 million in legal debts rung up during the Whitewater, campaign fundraising and Monica S. Lewinsky investigations." Several news reports echoed a similar estimate of legal costs, but we were unable to track down the source of that amount. The burden of legal costs didn’t entirely fall on the Clintons. Established in 1998, the Presidential Legal Expense Trust defrayed personal legal expenses through donations from U.S. citizens (government employees or registered lobbyists were not allowed). That was the second trust set up to pay off the Clintons’ legal expenses. In July 2001, The New Yorker reported the fund raised $8.8 million. "Even after expenses, that covered much of the eleven or twelve million dollars in legal fees that the Clintons have incurred so far," the report reads. (Clinton left the White House in January 2001.) That legal debt was gone by 2004, according to Hillary Clinton’s financial disclosure form. Jeff Hoopes, an accounting professor at University of North Carolina, told us there were numbers that may not have made it into the disclosure form, such as mortgages or loans from relatives. Mortgages could realistically have added a burden. In 1999, the Clintons bought a five-bedroom home in Chappaqua, N.Y., for $1.7 million. In December 2000, just as they were leaving the White House, they bought a seven-bedroom house near Embassy Row in Washington for $2.85 million. Citibank lent the Clintons $1.995 million to buy the Washington house. Hoopes emphasized that whatever the value of debt, the Clintons were unambiguously not suffering financially after leaving office. "They had a huge amount of earnings potential, and to keep suggesting they were suffering financially is disingenuous," Hoopes said. Hoopes’ point: The Clintons may have taken on debt but had a clear path to getting out of the red. And they sure did. Forbes, using Hillary Clinton’s tax returns, estimated the Clintons earned more than $240 million from 2001-15. Our ruling Clinton said he "left the White House $16 million in debt." Hillary Clinton’s 2000 Senate financial disclosure form shows a debt of anywhere between $1.75 million and maximum of $6.5 million. Bill Clinton’s spokesman said the Clintons’ legal fees reached $12 million, but a large portion of that was covered by a legal defense fund. We rate this Mostly False.

pomt-13069	Newt Gingrich has been a proponent of selecting a president by popular vote instead of the Electoral College.	true	/georgia/statements/2016/nov/16/various-media-reports/newt-gingrich-has-said-he-favors-using-popular-vot/	Newt Gingrich, a loyal Donald Trump surrogate and former Georgia congressman who became speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, is poised to play a key role in the 45th president’s new administration. But if Gingrich, who is a key player on the Trump transition team, had gotten what he wanted not so long ago, things would be different. According to news reports, Gingrich just a few years ago backed electing U.S. presidents through the so-called popular vote and not the Electoral College, which propelled Trump to victory last week over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Clinton is still leading the popular vote count. But under our current system that is irrelevant. It is the candidate who gets 270 Electoral College votes who wins. That is the way it has been throughout U.S. history. PolitiFact was curious. Had Gingrich backed vanquishing the Electoral College in favor of the popular vote -- a change that might have shoved him into political obscurity instead of where he stands now at center stage. The easy answer: Yes, he did. U.S. citizens only indirectly vote for the president and vice president. The U.S. Electoral College was established by Article II of the United States Constitution. Under that system, voters in each state choose a slate of "electors" pledged to vote for a party's candidate. In the 2016 election, Trump is expected to get 306 electoral votes to Clinton’s 232. In a Nov. 10 article, Mother Jones pointed to a 2014 letter to the group National Popular Vote by Gingrich. The nonpartisan group promotes legislation that would guarantee the presidency to the candidate who receives the most popular votes nationally. In the letter, Gingrich writes, "America would be better served with a presidential election process that treated citizens across the country equally." We reached out to Gingrich spokesman Joe Desantis. He pointed us to a statement made by Gingrich on Sunday’s "Face The Nation." When asked whether he was still a fan of getting rid of the Electoral College, Gingrich said, "I think, in the long run, you want to find a way to have the whole country represented." But for now, the only competitions that matter are the ones in the swing states. The GOP, Gingrich said, all but writes off traditional Democratic states such as California, which have huge popular vote totals. "Remember, in 49 states, he (Trump) had a 2.2 million-vote majority, and then there’s California," Gingrich said during his Sunday interview. "We don’t compete in California. He said GOP strategists don’t invest in California because they assume the party will not carry the state. "So it gets worse every year," he said. "If this had been a general election, where the total vote mattered, we would have competed in California". Kerwin Swint, a political scientist at Kennesaw State University in metro Atlanta, said Gingrich and a number of others, both Republican and Democrat, have voiced support for the National Popular Vote Compact. Under that compact, member states would pledge to cast its electoral votes for the winner of the nationwide popular vote. "The compact kicks in when enough states join the agreement that would equal 270 electoral votes," Swint said in an email "So far, enough states have joined that would equal 165 electoral votes, and they are all Democratic states." Swint said abolishing the Electoral College would require a two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress. Then comes the really tough part -- 38 out of 50 states would have to ratify it. "Not bloody likely, at least not in our lifetimes," he said. "Even Donald Trump criticized the Electoral College in 2012, but I bet he wouldn't now!" University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato said he doubts there is any new momentum to abolish the Electoral College by the party soon to be in charge of the White House and both chambers of Congress. "Not only have two GOP presidents been elected in the past 16 years by the College, despite losing the popular vote, but all five cases in history of the popular vote winner being denied the Presidency disadvantaged Democrats (1824, 1876, 1888, 2000, 2016)," Sabato wrote in an email. "Somehow I don't think reforming or abolishing the Electoral College will be a high priority going forward, even though Gallup has repeatedly shown that large majorities of Americans want the popular vote to pick the President." Our ruling Several media outlets have recently reported that Newt Gingrich previously advocated for electing U.S. presidents by popular vote instead of the Electoral College. Our research shows Gingrich was definitely an advocate of the popular vote option. We rate the reports True.	None	Various media reports	None	None	None	2016-11-16T06:00:00	2016-11-10	['Newt_Gingrich']
pomt-09205	“In three days last week, (Gov. Rick) Perry flew to five cities at taxpayers’ expense, holding press conferences, delivering $2,325,000 in checks.”	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2010/may/23/bill-white/white-says-taxpayers-paid-perry-fly-texas-deliveri/	In a Facebook post Wednesday, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White suggests Gov. Rick Perry wasted government dollars flying to Texas cities to give out money. “In three days last week, Perry flew to five cities at taxpayers’ expense, holding press conferences, delivering $2,325,000 in checks,” White’s 8:43 p.m. post states. Did Perry burn tax dollars to hand out checks? Katy Bacon, White’s spokeswoman, pointed out news releases issued by the governor’s office reflecting Perry’s stops May 11-13 in Corpus Christi, Dallas, San Antonio, Palacios and San Juan. The releases state that Perry announced spending awards of $150,000, $175,000 and $2 million, respectively, in Dallas, Palacios and San Juan. Perry did not ballyhoo funding awards in the other cities, according to the releases. That’s close to what White said on Facebook: Three days, five cities, $2,325,000 in checks handed over by Perry. We wondered, though, at White’s description of Perry’s flights as costing taxpayers. For years, Perry has funded considerable out-of-town travel, for state business or campaign purposes, from non-state sources including his campaign kitty — an approach often mentioned in news articles, including a July 26 report in White’s hometown newspaper, the Houston Chronicle. The Chronicle article quotes Perry’s gubernatorial spokeswoman, Allison Castle, noting that “Perry's travel is not paid by taxpayers.” It continues: “Texas One, a corporate-finance foundation, pays for much of Perry's business development travel. Other travel is paid for by his political committee or campaign donors. And some is financed as in-kind contributions from specific wealthy donors or interest groups.” As for the flights Facebooked by White, Bacon told us in an e-mail: “These were all ‘official’ trips and events under the Office of the Governor, and this type of travel is typically paid for by taxpayers.” Not so, said Castle, who informed us the flights under fire, on private planes, were funded by Perry’s campaign. “The majority of the governor’s travel is paid for by his campaign,” she said. For each of the five stops referenced by White, she said, one state-paid travel aide and a press aide accompanied Perry. There is another cost the public pays for every Perry trip — his security detail. In a follow-up interview, Bacon took no issue with gubernatorial security expenses. Bacon also stood by White's characterization of the travel as taxpayer-funded, saying it would take time to confirm, with documents, that Perry's flights were not paid for by the state. Then again, Bacon said, spending campaign funds on the flights also doesn't pass muster. "Either way, this is wrong," she said. "He’s running around handing out taxpayer dollars to get headlines for his political career. He’s using campaign dollars to hand out state checks." She showed us that Perry's campaign excerpted two press releases from the latest trips in a campaign e-mail blast. Bacon's charge shifts the focus from who paid for Perry's trips to the purpose of his stops. That's not what White critiqued on Facebook. All in all, White got several things right — five cities visited, press events, money awards. And it's true the state pays some costs any time the governor goes anywhere. But White's crucial assumption — that Perry's flights were at taxpayers' expense — is wrong. It's a misstep the candidate might have avoided by reading his local newspaper. Pants on Fire!

pomt-05100	Says the federal health care law upheld by the Supreme Court "has improved or saved the lives of more than 4,000 Texans" otherwise prevented from obtaining health coverage due to pre-existing conditions.	true	/texas/statements/2012/jun/29/becky-moeller/becky-moeller-says-over-4000-texas-lives-have-impr/	Celebrating the U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding the 2010 federal health care overhaul, a Texas labor leader said thousands of Texans have already benefited from it. In a June 28, 2012, statement, Becky Moeller, president of the Texas AFL-CIO, said of the new health care law: "It has improved or saved the lives of more than 4,000 Texans who otherwise would have run afoul of ‘pre-existing condition’ clauses preventing them from obtaining insurance." The law has helped that many Texans with pre-existing conditions? Refresher: The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act bars insurers, starting in 2014, from denying coverage to individuals due to pre-existing conditions. Until then, the act also provides for pre-existing condition insurance plans to be available to individuals who have been uninsured for at least six months because of a pre-existing condition, according to a timeline for the law posted online by the federal government. As the act was under debate, advocates said that without such provisions, coverage for people living with certain conditions including diabetes, cancer and HIV/AIDS would remain financially out of reach. By email, AFL-CIO spokesman Ed Sills told us Moeller’s figure traces to the White House, which has a web page showing a map of the United States under this headline: "What Health Reform Means to Your State." Clicking on Texas delivers a pop-up stating ways that the law is benefiting Texas, including: "4,029 people who were uninsured because of a pre-existing condition now have coverage." But those pop-out statistics are not sourced. As we mulled Moeller’s figure, state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, D-San Antonio, aired the same count in a statement lauding the court decision. Van de Putte’s spokesman, Lee Nichols, told us she drew the number from a document on the impact of the federal health law prepared by the Progressive States Network, a liberal-leaning public policy group. By email, the group pointed us to a February 2012 report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services stating that 27 states operate their own Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan, while 23 states (including Texas) chose to depend on federally run plans. It says, too, that the plans are helping 50,000 Americans who were previously unable to afford health coverage. And the report’s Appendix A says the Texas plan, which started in August 2010, had 4,029 individuals enrolled for coverage extending through December 2011. Through that month, Texas had the third-highest number of plan members, behind California, at 5,599, and Pennsylvania, at 4,567. We recognized this figure was not up to date. Fortunately, spokesman John Greeley of the Texas Department of Insurance alerted us to a June 15, 2012, posting on a website managed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Through April 2012, according to the post, 5,684 individuals were enrolled in the Texas plan. We paused, finally, over whether it’s fair to assume that each Texan in the program saw their lives improved or even saved, as Moeller puts it. Sills of the Texas AFL-CIO conceded by telephone that it’s possible some of the newly insured individuals subsequently experienced worsened conditions or died. Still, he said, it’s a reasonable inference that somebody who has insurance who didn’t previously have it has an improved life. "Even if they did die," Sill said, "it’s perfectly conceivable that they received treatment that made the rest of their lives better." Our ruling Moeller’s count of the Texans benefiting from newly having insurance despite pre-existing conditions is a bit understated. And while there’s no certainty that every beneficiary saw their lives improved or saved, we agree that's a reasonable supposition. We rate the claim True.

pomt-05198	"Romney outsourced call center jobs to India."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/11/barack-obama/obama-ad-says-romney-outsourced-massachusetts-jobs/	Mitt Romney says he speaks the language of business. But a new Obama campaign ad says Romney's economic record in Massachusetts shows he was unsuccessful and out of touch. The ad, dubbed "We’ve Heard it all Before," rattles off negative outcomes from Romney’s gubernatorial term: losses in manufacturing, near-the-bottom job creation, billions in public debt. This one caught our attention: "Instead of hiring workers from his own state, Romney outsourced call center jobs to India." Sending American jobs overseas is a touchy topic these days. We did some digging and found that the image in the ad -- a darkened Massachusetts workplace juxtaposed with an Indian man wearing a phone headset -- doesn’t tell the complete story. Origin of the charge The Obama campaign pointed us to news accounts of a budget issue in 2004, the second year of Romney’s term. The Democratic-controlled Massachusetts legislature sent Romney a budget with an amendment that "would prohibit Massachusetts from contracting with companies that ‘outsource’ the state's work to other countries," according to the Boston Globe. At the time, many states were contracting with companies that outsourced some form of their work overseas. The Government Accountability Office found that in 2005, 43 states had contracts with companies administering state programs in which some of the work, primarily customer service and software development, was done overseas. Expenditures for services performed offshore were relatively small, the GAO found, and services performed offshore constituted a tiny fraction of the total services provided through the contracts. But it was enough of a hot button that 38 states were considering similar bans on contracting with companies that outsourced, the Globe wrote. Romney, then, was forced to weigh two competing interests: protecting jobs in his state vs. saving taxpayers money. The Globe pointed out that lawmakers in Kansas considered a similar measure but pulled the plug when they learned it would cost the state an additional $640,000. Massachusetts’ proposal was favored by labor unions but opposed by some economists who said it didn’t make economic sense for taxpayers to pay more for low-skill jobs. Ultimately, Romney vetoed the measure because he said that even if those jobs were back in the United States, they would not necessarily have been in Massachusetts. He said,"There's no question we are affected by outsourcing, as is every other state. Any job that leaves is a big loss, and you want to fight to keep every job in the Commonwealth. The legislation I vetoed was not designed to do anything for Massachusetts employers. It might help ‘call center’ states, but it didn't necessarily protect a single job here. But it had the potential of costing our citizens a lot more money. Ultimately, how you compete with low-cost countries is having a more educated, innovative, hard-working, and capable workforce. And that means that you invest in two things: education and innovation." At the time Massachusetts had a $160,000 a month contract with Citigroup to process debit cards for food stamps. Citigroup outsourced its customer service call center to a facility in India. A small but important detail: the state didn’t outsource the work -- a state contractor did. The GAO report looking at all states’ outsourcing found that 43 states had some form of outsourcing at work, so Massachusetts was not unique. The Bay State also had offshore contracts through its child support enforcement and unemployment insurance programs in 2005, the GAO said. The controversy popped up again in 2006 when then-Sen. Edward Kennedy criticized Romney for "jumping on the offshoring bandwagon,'' according to a Boston Herald story. A Romney official told the newspaper that by then, only a handful of overseas workers were still working on a Medicaid subcontract. The food stamp contract previously held by Citigroup (later JP Morgan Chase) had expired and the new contract was awarded to a company whose call center was in Utah. Our ruling Obama’s ad charges that "Romney outsourced call center jobs to India." The Obama campaign's wording suggests a broader, more deliberate policy when the state was sending some work overseas. But in choosing to veto the bill, Romney let the arrangement continue. The statement leaves out important information. We rate it Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-06-11T16:30:49	2012-06-04	['None']
pomt-04185	Says state schools superintendent candidate Don Pridemore "voted for the largest cuts to public education in our state history" and for "$2.3 billion in tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/dec/12/one-wisconsin-now/candidate-wisconsin-schools-chief-backed-biggest-e/	The liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now has long been critical of state Rep. Don Pridemore, especially when blasting bills he authored that would affect police treatment of immigrants and require voters to present photo identification. Now that Pridemore, a Republican from suburban Milwaukee, is challenging state schools superintendent Tony Evers in the April 2013 election, One Wisconsin Now has made a new attack. In a news release Dec. 3, 2012, the day Pridemore announced his candidacy, the Madison-based group claimed Pridemore "voted for the largest cuts to public education in our state history -- nearly $2 billion between K-12 and the University of Wisconsin and Wisconsin Technical College Systems -- in favor of $2.3 billion in tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy." Both the funding cuts and tax cuts parts of this claim are similar to claims we've rated before. How do they stack up when combined? Education funding cuts To back the first part of the claim, One Wisconsin Now executive director Scot Ross cited a February 2012 Truth-O-Meter item that evaluated a nearly identical statement. In that item, we rated as True an attack by Kathleen Falk that GOP Gov. Scott Walker enacted "the biggest cuts to education in our state’s history." Falk ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination to challenge Walker in the June 2012 recall election. We found that Walker’s 2011-2013 state budget, which Pridemore voted for, cut $1.11 billion in state aid to school districts, the university system and technical colleges. But that’s far short of the nearly $2 billion that One Wisconsin Now claimed. Moreover, the claim ignores the fact that school districts and other local governments were able to offset the cuts by forcing employees to pay a greater share of their health care and pension costs. One Wisconsin Now highlights just one side of the equation. Ross said his math puts the total cut at nearly $2 billion because the budget reduced by $800 million the amount of property taxes that local school districts can levy. But limiting a school district’s ability to raise taxes is not the same as a straight budget cut, which is what One Wisconsin Now claims in its attack on Pridemore. Tax cuts The second part of the group’s claim against Pridemore -- that he voted for "$2.3 billion in tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy" -- is similar to a One Wisconsin Now claim we rated in July 2011. In that item, the group said Walker’s budget has "tax breaks for corporations and the rich that will cost the state of Wisconsin taxpayers $2.3 billion over the next decade." We rated the statement Half True. We found that Walker’s budget -- along with other tax provisions adopted in 2011 -- will result in a total reduction of $2.3 billion in general fund tax revenue over 10 years. However, while many tax breaks go to corporations and individuals with higher incomes, some go to small businesses and to average taxpayers. Pridemore and other Republicans have argued that the tax cuts give incentives to employers to create more jobs. What’s more, One Wisconsin Now pairs up the 10-year figure with an annual one for school funding, skewing the comparison. Our rating One Wisconsin Now said Pridemore voted for "the largest cuts to public education in our state history" -- nearly $2 billion -- and for "$2.3 billion in tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy." Pridemore voted for the largest cuts to education -- but they amount to about $1 billion, not nearly $2 billion, over two years. And Pridemore voted for $2.3 billion in tax breaks, but they don’t benefit only corporations and the wealthy. We rate One Wisconsin Now’s claim Half True.

pomt-01092	"The average family not in the top 10 percent makes less money today than they were making a generation ago."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/13/elizabeth-warren/warren-average-family-bottom-90-percent-made-more-/	Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., believes the government’s economic policies over the past few decades have "cut the legs out from underneath America's middle class." At the AFL-CIO National Summit on Raising Wages Jan. 7, Warren spoke about growing income inequality, particularly since the 1980s, when the "trickle-down economics" policies gained traction under former President Ronald Reagan. She argued that this theory -- that giving tax breaks and other economic benefits to corporations and the wealthy will benefit the poor by improving the economy overall -- hasn’t worked. Warren, a former law professor and expert on the economic challenges of the middle class, cited a number of statistics to support her point, including: "Well, since 1980, guess how much of the growth in income over the last 32 years -- how much of the growth in income did the 90 percent get? Zero. None. Nothing. In fact, it is worse than that. The average family not in the top 10 percent makes less money today than they were making a generation ago." We wondered if that was true -- that the bottom 90 percent of earners in America have a lower income than they had more than 30 years ago. The statistic comes from data compiled by well-known economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, who study income inequality. Their World Top Incomes Database specializes in cataloging the highest level of incomes over time in more than 20 countries. To check out Warren’s claim, we looked at average income data from 1979 to 2012 for the top 10 percent and bottom 90 percent of earners. (The time frame Warren used in her speech was "a generation," which is vague, but in context it’s clear she’s talking about since the 1980s.) The Saez-Piketty data comes from millions of tax returns filed over the past century. The data supports her claim. Adjusted for inflation, the top 10 percent of earners in the United States made, on average, $144,418 in 1979 and $254,449 in 2012. That’s about 76 percent growth. The bottom 90 percent of earners, on the other hand, made $33,526 in 1979 and $30,438 in 2012. That’s a decrease of about 9 percent. This chart generated on the Saez-Piketty top income database shows the growth of the top 10 percent of earners’ average income over time, compared to the relatively stagnant progression of the bottom 90 percent of earners’ average income. Compare this to the 30 years prior, where -- according to Saez and Piketty’s data -- the average income for the bottom 90 percent of earners grew alongside the top 10 percent, albeit at a slower pace. However there is some context to consider. Mainly, not everyone approves of the Saez-Piketty approach to cataloging income. Their approach uses pre-tax income and includes realized capital gains. Because the richest Americans earn a lot of capital gains and pay a lot of taxes, this arguably magnifies their income. On the other hand, the approach lowballs the income of lower-level earners -- the bottom 90 percent in this case. The income calculation does not include government payments, such as Social Security, unemployment insurance, food stamps and the earned income tax credit. Salim Furth, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, also noted that the data looks at "tax units" -- individuals or married couples filing together -- rather than households, which may artificially lower average incomes. For example, a young adult living with his parents are two separate tax units; together they are one household or family. The Saez-Piketty data captures that the young worker has a very small income, but not the fact that he lives in a house with multiple incomes. Also, tax law has changed over the past 50 years to increase the number of units, Furth said. Of the general trend in income growth, he said, "Data sources that are more widely used show solid, though not fantastic, income growth for most of the income distribution through 2007. There are big losses in the Great Recession, and then an incomplete recovery since then." The Congressional Budget Office produced a report in November 2014 showing that the bottom 80 percent of earners (measured by households rather than tax units) saw income increases of about 16 percent between 1979 and 2011. The top 81-99 percent, on the other hand, saw increases of about 56 percent over the period. And the top 1 percent alone saw their household income grow 174 percent. That report also found that if it includes government benefits in its income calculation, all income brackets saw even more income growth. Still, this data shows that top earners’ incomes are growing at a faster pace than everyone else’s -- which supports Warren’s broader point. Richard Burkhauser, an economist at Cornell University, pointed us to a paper he co-wrote on income inequality that compares Saez-Piketty-style data to other income measurements. The results are consistent with the Saez-Piketty data until households are adjusted for size, and capital gains taxes and government payments are factored in. With those controls, incomes have grown across the board, and income inequality has also grown -- but not at as dramatic a rate as the Saez-Piketty data implies. Ultimately, Burkhauser’s report concludes that different measurements work for different policy questions. If Warren’s talking specifically about market income -- that is, income earned before taxes and before government payments -- the Saez-Piketty data "is appropriate, and undoubtedly income inequality has grown substantially in recent years, and the middle class is struggling." If the question is, alternatively, whether government programs are doing something to close the gap and help the middle class -- other measures show that programs like food stamps and Medicaid are helping to a certain extent, at least for people who qualify. (And of course not everyone in the bottom 90 percent of earners does qualify.) Arguably, in a speech directed at working and middle-class Americans at a summit on raising wages, the context of Warren’s remarks give credence to the fact that she was referencing data that emphasizes earned income over government-provided income. In the speech, Warren wasn’t advocating for new government programs that give out payments to individuals in need. She was making a policy argument against the idea of trickle-down economics and in favor of broad economic policies that she believes would improve Americans’ job-earned income, like raising the minimum wage and breaking up the Wall Street banks. "We can make new choices," she said. "And one way to make those choices is to talk openly and honestly and directly about work, about how we value work, and how we value those who do the work." Our ruling Warren said, "The average family not in the top 10 percent makes less money today than they were making a generation ago." According to one measurement, the bottom 90 percent of American earners had a lower income in 2012 than they had 30 years ago. By other measurements -- mainly ones that include government payments such as Social Security -- incomes have grown across the board. However, this data still supports Warren’s overall point that income inequality is growing. Additionally, given the context of her speech at a forum about wages, it makes sense that Warren would reference data that gives more weight to pre-tax income. She’s arguing that middle-class wages haven’t increased enough over the past couple decades. We rate Warren’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-01199	The poorest counties in the U.S. are in Appalachia and "happen to be more than 90 percent white."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2014/dec/01/jim-webb/jim-webb-says-poorest-us-counties-are-appalachia-a/	Former Sen. Jim Webb recently announced he’s considering a 2016 presidential run and placed economic fairness high on his agenda. In his video announcement, Webb urged people to travel to inner cities to view the "poverty, crime and lack of opportunity that still affects so many African Americans." "Or travel to the Appalachian mountains, where my own ancestors settled and whose cultural values I still share, and view the poorest counties in America -- who happen to be more than 90 percent white, and who live in the reality that ‘if you’re poor and white, you’re out of sight,’" Webb said. Are the poorest counties in the U.S. located in Appalachia and more than 90 percent white? We asked Webb for proof. Amy Hogan, Webb’s daughter and occasional spokesperson, sent us links to the WikiPedia pages for Clay County, Ky. and Leslie County, Ky. -- two Appalachian counties located in the economically-distressed eastern portion of that state. But Hogan didn’t point to any information that indicates those counties are the poorest in the U.S., although the Clay County WikiPedia page says its per capita income and median household income make it one of the poorest counties in the country. So we set out on our own search for the poorest counties, relying on data by the U.S. Census Bureau measuring the average yearly wealth from 2008-2012. As our colleagues at PolitiFact National noted in a July story, there are several ways to gauge the poorest counties. We compiled Bottom 10 lists based on three criteria. Lowest Median Household Income: Owsley County, Ky., $19,624 Jefferson County, Miss., $20,281 Wolfe County, Ky., $21,168 Brooks County, Texas, $21,445 McCreary County, Ky., $21,758 Hudspeth County, Texas, $22,083 Hancock County, Tenn., $22,205 Jackson County, Ky., $22,213 Clay County, Ky., $22,296 Holmes County, Miss., $22,335 Six of these counties are in Appalachia, according to a listing by the congressionally-funded Appalachian Regional Commission -- the five in Kentucky and Hancock County, Tenn. All six have populations that are more than 90 percent white. The two counties in Mississippi are about 85 percent black and the two in Texas are more than 77 percent Hispanic and Latino. Highest percentage of people below the poverty line: Shannon County, S.D., 49.5 percent Clay County, Ga., 47.7 percent East Carroll Parish, La., 44.9 percent Sioux County, N.D., 44.8 percent Todd County, S.D., 44.6 percent Hudspeth County, Texas, 42.7 percent Holmes County, Miss., 42.6 percent Corson County, S.D., 41.7 percent Wolfe County, Ky., 41.4 percent Humphreys County, Miss., 41.2 percent The only Appalachian county on that list is Wolfe County, Ky., which is 90 percent white. Hudspeth County, Texas is 78 percent Hispanic and Latino. Of the other eight counties, the ones in North and South Dakota are mostly Native American and the ones in Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi are at least two-thirds black. Lowest per capita income: Wheeler County, Ga., $8,809 Shannon County, S.D., $9,136 Hancock County, Ga., $11,225 Todd County, S.D., $11,417 Starr County, Texas, $11,537 Jefferson County, Miss., $11,771 Willacy County, Texas, $11,895 Zavala County, Texas, $11,919 McCreary County, Ky., $12,213 Holmes County, Miss., $12,278 There’s one Appalachian locality on this list: McCreary County, Ky., which is 90 percent white. Hancock County, Ga. is 60 percent white.The counties in Mississippi are about 85 percent black, the ones in South Dakota are about 90 percent Native American, and those in Texas are at least 87 percent Hispanic and Latino. In sharing these lists, we don’t mean to downplay the very real existence of poverty in Appalachian counties that span 13 states, including Virginia. The Appalachian Regional Commission says there are 311 U.S. counties that are economically distressed based on measurements of unemployment, poverty and per capita market income. About 10 percent of all U.S. counties fall into this category. Ninety of the 420 counties in Appalachia are economically distressed. In other words, 21 percent of the counties in the region fall into the category -- more than twice the national average. Louis Segesvary, a spokesman for the commission, told us the major issue facing these Appalachian communities are their geographic isolation in the mountain range. Our ruling Webb said that the poorest U.S. counties are in Appalachia and "happen to be more than 90 percent white." No doubt, some of the poorest are in Appalachia, particularly eastern Kentucky. But looking at several different measures of county poverty results in a more complex picture than Webb suggests. Measured by median household income, overwhelmingly white Appalachian counties comprise six of the 10 U.S. counties with the lowest median household income. But measured by the poverty rate, only one mostly-white Appalachian county ranks in the 10 poorest. The other nine -- in the South, the Dakotas or Texas -- have larger majorities that are either black, Native American, or Hispanic and Latino. That pattern pretty much holds up when you rank the poorest counties by lowest per capita income. So Webb’s statement is partially accurate, but needs context. We rate it Half True.

pomt-10675	"And, you know, our first president and our first commander in chief prayed every day. He had a field manual of prayers."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/18/duncan-hunter/hunter-perpetuates-common-myth/	Appearing on Fox News in October, Duncan Hunter proclaimed his support for allowing a religious slant on the flag-folding ceremony at U.S. military funerals. To defend his position, Hunter tapped a reliable and potent source to justify weaving church and state: George Washington. "This is supposedly done under the separation of church and state, but you can't separate a veteran from his flag," Hunter told interviewer Bill Hemmer. "And, you know, our first president and our first commander in chief prayed every day. He had a field manual of prayers." Whether Hunter knew it or not, Washington wasn't the most religious founding father. And the story of his personal prayer book was debunked in the early 20th century. His remarks actually tap into a debate among scholars about the extent of Washington's religious convictions. Many argue he was more a deist than a Christian. "It's a tricky area that keeps coming up again and again," said Phil Chase, a senior editor at the Papers of George Washington Project at the University of Virginia. "People tend to attribute their own views to someone in the past. ... It happens a lot with Washington." Evangelical minister Tim LaHaye, author of the Left Behind series, is the latest. In his book about the founding father's faith, LaHaye wrote that the fact that Washington "was a devout believer in Jesus Christ and had accepted Him as His Lord and Saviour is easily demonstrated by a reading of his personal prayer book, written in his own handwriting." Except that's not true. Washington scholar Rupert Hughes wrote in 1926 that no evidence connects Washington to this prayer book, which was found nearly a century after his death in a old trunk. Hughes consulted a penmanship expert who proved it wasn't even in Washington's handwriting. "We are very confident that this prayer book is not Washington's prayer book," Chase said. Fortunately for Hunter, it's a common myth. Otherwise, we might give him a Pants-on-Fire ruling.	None	Duncan Hunter	None	None	None	2007-12-18T00:00:00	2007-10-31	['None']
pomt-01831	Says the Obama administration never responded to his 2012 letter flagging the uptick in unaccompanied children crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/jul/18/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-obama-didnt-respond-his-warning-ab/	In an interview, Rick Perry charged the federal government with failing to tune in when the Republican governor of Texas wrote the Democratic president two years earlier about an increasing flow of children across the U.S.-Mexico border. "This president, I will suggest, is totally and absolutely either inept," Perry told Fox News, his voice rising, "or making some decisions that are not in the best interests of American citizens, particularly from a public safety standpoint. We flagged this issue in 2012 and have yet to even have a response, as far as I know, from, not just, not from the president, but not even from his administration." We previously checked other claims Perry made in the June 17, 2014, interview on Fox & Friends, rating as True his statement that a record number of immigrants not from Mexico were being apprehended at the border, a spike that was in full swing by 2012. We found Pants on Fire his suggestion that recent border-crossers are coming from terrorism-linked countries like Syria. And did Perry flag the surge in unaccompanied children years ago to no federal response? Perry cites two letters To our inquiry, Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed said Perry was referring to letters sent to President Barack Obama and a Department of Homeland Security official, respectively, by Perry and a gubernatorial aide in May 2012. Perry’s May 4, 2012, letter to the president, covered at the time by the Texas Tribune and Dallas Morning News, accused the Obama administration of failing to work with the home countries of immigrant children to arrange for their return. His letter said in part, "as your administration is fully aware, there is a surge of unaccompanied illegal minors entering the United States." It said later: "Inaction encourages other minors to place themselves in extremely dangerous situations. The vast majority of these unaccompanied illegal minors come from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, as well as Mexico." Urging Obama to immediately consult the governments of such countries, Perry closed: "This must stop, Mr. President, and it is your responsibility to make that happen." Six days later, Perry adviser Chelsea Buchholtz sent a letter to a Department of Homeland Security official, Kelly Ryan, thanking Ryan for a conference call on May 4, the day that Perry’s letter was sent. Buchholtz’s letter said the call brought together federal agencies including Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Health and Human Services to speak with the governor’s office regarding the unaccompanied children surging into Texas. In her letter, Buchholtz asked 18 questions starting with the number of unaccompanied children apprehended in Texas and the number of children remaining in the state "after completion of their immigration cases." Other questions focused on the number of children in specific categories including those with gang affiliation, with a criminal a record or placed into foster care. "Please provide this information categorized by nationality for the last 10 fiscal years," Buchholtz wrote. No replies? Via the Texas Public Information Act, we asked Perry’s office for texts, emails, letters or other documented evidence of federal responses to the letters. Gubernatorial attorney Chris Sterner replied by email there was "no information responsive to your request." We shared Sterner’s response with the White House. Obama spokesman Shawn Turner replied by email that while Perry’s letter "did not make any requests of the president, we did respond to his concerns. We thought it was important to expand our dialogue with the governor and his staff so we held a number of briefs and engaged in several conversations with the governor's team. The briefs and discussions were intended to give the governor’s team a clear understanding of the administration’s focus on the immigration issues at the border and discuss steps we’re taking to deal with the situation." We requested dates and times of the briefings. Turner said he didn’t have such such specifics. Perry’s office didn’t respond to our inquiry about briefings. Our ruling Perry said the Obama administration failed to respond to his 2012 letter flagging an uptick in unaccompanied children crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. The day Perry sent his letter, Obama administration officials joined a conference call with his office about the crossings. It’s not clear whether this call was in response to the letter or vice versa, but it does seem to show the border situation had the attention of federal and state authorities. Otherwise, we found no documentation, in Austin or Washington, D.C., of a formal administration reply or of briefings like the ones referenced by the White House spokesman. On balance, we rate Perry’s statement as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-14981	"We have the highest funding in (the) K-12 system in the history of the state."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2015/oct/15/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-k-12-funding-highest-states-histor/	Amid his calls for legislators to cut taxes by hundreds of millions of dollars next year, Gov. Rick Scott bragged that Florida’s education system is getting record funding on his watch. During a news conference on Oct. 14, 2015, Scott called for tax cuts beyond the $400 million the Legislature approved earlier in the year. Scott had promised to cut taxes by $1 billion over two years, but lawmakers are already signaling that may not be possible. When a reporter asked Scott how he can push tax cuts and still guarantee public schools the capital funding they need, Scott repeated a boast he’s made before: "We have the highest funding in (the) K-12 system in the history of the state." Scott and Florida Republicans have been making the claim since his 2014 re-election campaign that school funding has been at historic levels, but it’s simply not a complete picture of the education budget. (Scott intends to release his full budget proposal in December.) We decided it was time to revisit this particular claim. Total vs. per-pupil vs. inflation The education budget has been a prickly issue for Scott since he recommended major cuts in his first year in office. State tax revenues have recovered with the end of the recession, and Scott has pushed to move the budget back up each year since, which has led to his current claim. While Scott and former Gov. Charlie Crist squabbled during the 2014 gubernatorial campaign over who held the spending record, we noted they both could stake a claim: Scott had the largest budget in total dollars, while Crist spent the most per student back in 2007-08. With Scott well into his second term, the same is still true today. After winning re-election, Scott wanted to bump up spending in his January 2015 budget proposal, to $19.75 billion total and $7,176 per pupil. That would have been about $850,000 higher than the previous year’s budget, and $50 higher per student than the record of $7,126 under Crist. But the Legislature has the final say, and faced a budget deadlock over several issues, including a debate about potentially expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. After a special session in the summer to hammer out a budget, the Legislature didn’t give Scott the amount he wanted. We checked the latest calculations for the Florida Education Finance Program, a pot of state and local money for schools that is adjusted periodically throughout the year to factor in tax receipts and enrollment. We found that for the 2015-16 school year, the K-12 system is getting a total budget of about $19.7 billion, or about $7,105 per student . Let’s take a look at the past few years to get a better idea of how much money has been going to education spending. Fiscal year (governor) Total K-12 budget Per pupil spending K-12 enrollment 2007-08 (Crist) $18.7 billion $7,126 2.63 million 2008-09 (Crist) $17.9 billion $6,846 2.62 million 2009-10 (Crist)* $18 billion $6,846 2.63 million 2010-11 (Crist)* $18.2 billion $6,897 2.64 million 2011-12 (Scott) $16.6 billion $6,217 2.67 million 2012-13 (Scott) $17.2 billion $6,376 2.70 million 2013-14 (Scott) $18.3 billion $6,769 2.705 million 2014-15 (Scott) $18.9 billion $6,915 2.74 million 2015-16 (Scott) $19.7 billion $7,105 2.77 million *Includes federal stimulus money There are some details about the funding that we won’t explore in much detail. The two years marked with an asterisk were years when Florida used about $900 million each in federal stimulus money for the budget, for example. Also, the amount of property taxes collected through what is known as the Required Local Effort can change from year to year. Scott's office said the budget is at its highest level ever in terms of total dollars. But you would expect it to be, considering the K-12 school system also has its highest enrollment ever. There are about 100,000 more students today than when Scott took office, and about 140,000 more than when Crist oversaw the highest per-pupil spending in 2007-08. The money in today’s budget isn’t exceeding the record level in terms of sheer dollars per student, but that’s even less so when we factor for inflation. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index inflation calculator, which is somewhat imprecise but can give us broad insight on the subject, even Scott’s January 2015 request to best Crist’s spending by $50 per student lags far behind. Just to match 2007’s $7,126, per-pupil spending would have to be in the neighborhood of $8,190 today. Using this method, the current total budget would have to be in excess of $21.4 billion. We’ve rated claims similar to this one Half True in the past, but it’s apparent that Scott’s claim is misleading. Any reasonable person would expect a growing education system to naturally have a larger budget after nearly a decade. In this case, the dollars simply don’t go as far as they once did. Our ruling Scott said, "We have the highest funding in (the) K-12 system in the history of the state." That’s accurate in one sense, because the state’s total education budget is at an all-time high of $19.7 billion. But enrollment is also higher than in years past. Per-pupil spending is still below historic dollar totals and remains far below equitable levels when adjusted for inflation. Education spending has essentially stood still over the last nine years. Scott’s claim obscures that. The statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts. We rate it Mostly False.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2015-10-15T16:14:32	2015-10-14	['None']
pomt-10761	"Going to public financing really disadvantages Democrats because you're not able to raise funds between the day you win the primaries and the time you're officially nominated."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/26/bill-richardson/its-not-as-risky-as-he-says/	In an Oct. 5, 2007, interview on CNN, New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson said Former Sen. John Edwards would be at a disadvantage by accepting public matching funds for the primary race. The suggestion to Democratic voters was that Richardson would be a better nominee than Edwards, who said he would take public money, because Richardson wouldn't be hamstrung by the restrictions that come with publicly subsidized campaigns. Other Democratic candidates have made the same point, noting that Edwards would have to cap spending at $50.9-million during the primary period. That period begins Jan. 1, 2008, and formally ends at the party convention next August. Critics argue that if Edwards were the nominee, presumably in the spring, he wouldn't have enough money left to defend against Republican attacks over the summer. That's not entirely true. First, it's incorrect to categorically say Edwards wouldn't be able to raise money between the primaries and the nomination. If Edwards' spending was short of the $50.9-million cap after the primaries, there's nothing in federal regulations that would prevent him from raising more primary money. But let's assume the predictions are true that the current campaign cycle will break spending records. Let's say Edwards spends all the way up to the $50.9-million cap on his way to becoming the presumptive nominee. Yes, the rules would prevent his campaign from spending any more at that point. But is he automatically disadvantaged, as Richardson suggests? Not necessarily. Richardson's statement does not consider that the Democratic Party could spend millions on a summer campaign if a clear nominee emerged by then. Independent groups and individuals also could chip in. Consider the last presidential election. Total spending by the parties, independent groups and individuals on behalf of candidates totaled $192.4-million in 2004 — up from $14.7-million in 2000. What's more, Edwards could help raise money for the party, which could "spend unlimited funds on his behalf," said Steve Weissman, associate director for policy at The Campaign Finance Institute. "So it's not exactly true that Edwards would have no resources," he said. The caveat: The law sets a limit on how much money the party and Edwards could spend while coordinating their efforts. The bulk of the money would have to be spent without coordination. Not being able to coordinate with the party can be a less efficient way to operate, Weissman said. "It would be more difficult for Edwards," he said, "but I wouldn't say impossible." In addition, Richardson's statement doesn't contemplate the possibility of John McCain being the presumptive Republican nominee. In August, McCain became the first presidential candidate to qualify for federal matching funds in the primaries, and he has indicated he might accept the money. Should McCain accept public financing and emerge as his party's presumptive nominee, he and Edwards would be in the same boat when it came to fundraising. The general point that Richardson makes is valid: a candidate's hands are tied by rules governing federal matching money — especially the state-specific spending limits that are based on voting age population instead of political reality. But he overstates the case that Edwards' campaign would be "really" hurt during the important months before the convention. We find his statement Half True.

pomt-04919	Says Milken Institute rated San Antonio as nation’s top-performing local economy.	true	/texas/statements/2012/aug/01/julian-castro/julian-castro-says-milken-institute-named-san-anto/	With the announcement that San Antonio’s mayor will deliver the Sept. 4, 2012, keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention, we revisited his keynote at the Texas Democratic Party convention. In that June 8, 2012, speech -- which we’ve previously dipped into twice -- Julián Castro said his city’s investments in infrastructure and education paid off "late last year when San Antonio was ranked as the top-performing local economy by the Milken Institute." San Antonio topped Milken’s 2011 list of the nation’s best-performing large metropolitan areas, rocketing up from 14th place the year before. Its rise is part of a recent trend in which Texas cities have dominated the list as the nation recovers from the 2007-09 recession. The economic think tank’s annual list, which Milken spokesman Conrad Kiechel told us by phone has been issued in its current form for "more than a decade," was described in a Dec. 30, 2011, Texas Tribune news story as "a ranking that measures American metropolitan areas based on their ability to create and sustain jobs." Milken’s 2011 report on the best-performing cities says the index gives priority to job and pay gains, then some weight to several technology measures in relation to national averages: the local growth in high-tech gross domestic product, the concentration of tech industries and how many of 25 specific tech industries are concentrated there. Some measures are weighed across five-year spans, to flatten out extreme swings, and the most recent year, "to capture recent momentum." In recent years, the Tribune said, "companies have flocked to San Antonio, making it an economic center rivaling Houston and Dallas." In contrast to those cities, though, "San Antonio has attracted high-wage jobs, capitalizing on its booming medical research industry." The Tribune story said InCube and Medtronic were the latest bioscience companies to move to San Antonio, which was already home to global headquarters for Valero Energy, Clear Channel Communications, USAA insurers and the H-E-B grocery chain. The San Antonio Express-News credited the city’s rise to reasons "including military base realignment, drilling in the Eagle Ford Shale and the growth of health care" in a Dec. 16, 2011, news story. Texas cities held four of the top five spots on Milken’s 2011 big-cities list, with Austin/Round Rock at fourth. Back in 2008, Austin was Texas’ only top-five city, but the state claimed most of those slots in 2009, 2010 and 2011. The other chart-toppers for 2011 were No. 2, El Paso; No. 3, Fort Collins/Loveland, Colo.; and No. 5, Killeen/Temple/Fort Hood. Texas’ rise in the ranks, the Express-News wrote, came partly because of downturns in other parts of the country. The story quoted research economist James Gaines of Texas A&M University’s Real Estate Center: "Our growth rate and advancement isn't all that wonderful. We've managed to stay flat or have very small positives. But because everybody has so many negatives, we look so much better." A Philadelphia Inquirer columnist interviewed Milken’s chief research officer, Ross DeVol, and wrote Dec. 16, 2011 that "Technology and energy explain why nine Texas cities placed in the top 25 of the 2011 Milken ranking." Our ruling San Antonio hasn’t just been holding steady in the economic downturn; it’s been gaining ground, even compared to other Texas cities. Castro’s statement rates True.

pomt-14266	Says Bernie Sanders "wants higher standards for toy guns than real guns."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/08/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-bernie-sanders-wants-higher-s/	Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders is putting gun manufacturers ahead of the Sandy Hook victims, says opponent Hillary Clinton. Twenty school-age children were killed in the 2012 shooting massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Now, some family members of the victims are attempting to sue gun manufacturer Remington, which produced shooter Adam Lanza’s weapon, as well as the wholesaler and a local retailer. But it’s questionable whether this lawsuit will be able to proceed, given a 2005 law that put restrictions on the gun industry’s liability for crimes committed using their products. As Clinton often points out, she voted against this law, while Sanders voted for it. "I voted against it," Clinton said on CNN April 6. "President Obama voted against it. Because clearly it was an effort to bypass legal accountability. And so here we have this remarkable situation where you cannot question the liability or the behavior of gunmakers and sellers. I thought Sen. Chris Murphy from Connecticut really summed it up. He said Sen. Sanders wants higher standards for toy guns than real guns." The claim that Sanders wants higher standards for toy guns than real guns caught our attention. We wondered if Sanders’ support for this law indicates that he thinks toy manufacturers should be more open to lawsuits than gun manufacturers. We talked to a number of experts on gun law and products liability, and they disagreed over whether Clinton is standing on solid ground. A liability gap? The law at issue is the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush and seen as a victory for gun rights advocates. The purpose of the law is to protect gun dealers and manufacturers from lawsuits when their products are misused, meaning if a gun dealer legally sells a person a gun, and then the buyer uses the gun to commit a crime, the gun dealer and manufacturer cannot be held liable for the crime. The law arose after victims, cities and states started to bring lawsuits against gunmakers that pursued new legal paths, such as one that argued manufacturers Glock Inc. and China North Industries had oversaturated the market, producing so many guns that it was inevitable some would fall into criminal hands. Most judges dismissed these kinds of lawsuits, but a minority allowed them to proceed. There are several situations that are not protected from lawsuits under the law. It does not protect gun dealers who transfer a gun knowing it would be used for criminal purposes, nor those who knowingly break state or federal law if the violation results in harm. Gun manufacturers can also be sued if the gun, when used properly, causes injury because the product is defective. Opponents argue that the law stops some victims from having their day in court because the liability immunity is so broad and ambiguous, while the exceptions are narrow. Supporters, though, say the law protects gun dealers and manufacturers from frivolous and expensive legal proceedings. We’ve written before that Congress has passed laws giving some other industries varying levels of immunity. A couple experts told us Clinton’s statement is unsound because the law sought to impose equivalent, rather than fewer, standards for gun makers that are already established for manufacturers of other products. As it stands, the victim of a crime committed with a toy — say, if a person seriously injured another person by shooting them with bb gun pellets — generally cannot sue the toy manufacturer, just as they can’t sue Toyota or Budweiser if they’re struck by a drunk person driving a Prius. The 2005 law "basically put gun manufacturers in the same position that other product manufacturers are in," said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles. "They’re responsible for defectively manufactured and designed products but not for failing to prevent criminal misuse of their products." Additionally, toy guns and real guns pose fundamentally different risks because real guns are much more likely to be used in a crime than a toy gun, said Timothy Lytton, a Georgia State University law professor who edited a book on suing gun industry. So before the law, the gun industry was subject to a wider range of liability that just doesn’t apply to a toy. As such, it’s hard to imagine a realistic incident with a toy gun that would cause someone to bring a suit against the toy company, yet they would not be able to sue a gun manufacturer for an equivalent situation involving a real gun. A hypothetical situation might be if a city experienced an epidemic of deaths or injuries that resulted from a prevalence of realistic-looking toy guns; think of the recent story of Tamir Rice, a Cleveland child carrying a toy gun who a police officer shot and killed, said Alexandra Lahav, a professor of civil procedure at the University of Connecticut School of Law. In that case, a city might want to bring a suit against the toy gun manufacturer or seller for creating a public nuisance. But under the 2005 law, a city cannot sue a gun company if there is an epidemic of people being injured or killed by their guns. Lahav added, though, that she thinks the idea someone would bring a suit like this against a toy company is highly unlikely. In theory, there might be a liability gap between toy guns and real guns, but that wouldn't necessarily play out in reality, she said. Toy and real gun manufactures can be sued for product defects that cause injury when the product is used as intended. But if an injury is caused by a product defect coupled with a criminal misuse of the product, a toy gun manufacturer could be held liable, but a real gun manufacturer could not under the 2005 law, said Adam Winkler, also a UCLA law professor and an expert in the Second Amendment. That limits the gun industry’s incentives to make their products as safe as possible. The fact that a party cannot even attempt to bring these kinds of lawsuits against real gun manufacturers sets them apart from other industries, including toys, said Mark Geistfeld, a law professor at New York University and an expert in products liability. Such lawsuits against the gun industry might be destined to fail, but the 2005 law doesn’t even allow for the arguments to be tested. "You’ve granted an immunity to the gun industry that you haven’t granted to any other industry," Geistfeld said of Sanders, noting that this supports the gist of Clinton’s point: that Sanders holds guns to a lower standard. Lytton noted, though, that he would not presume to know whether Sanders would grant similar immunity to the toy industry if the opportunity arose. "It’s not fair to basically enter into hyperbole that somehow he treated firearms differently he would come down harder on toy guns," Lytton said. Consumer safety votes We also wanted to note another piece of evidence the Clinton campaign sent us to show that Sanders supports higher standards for toy guns. They pointed to Sanders’ congressional votes in favor of the 1993 Child Safety Protection Act and the 2008 Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, both of which became law. These bills dealt with things like putting warning labels on toys with choking hazards, increasing civil penalties on companies that produce defective products, and limiting lead in toys. Experts told us that these votes do not have any impact on Clinton’s argument one way or another because they are about product safety regulations, which are a totally different ballgame than tort law and product liability. Though he thinks Clinton’s claim is on point because of the points discussed earlier, Geistfeld called these votes a red herring. "You don’t have to love that (2005) law to see that it’s a very different thing," said Lahav of the University of Connecticut. "I would have never thought to compare these things." Our ruling Clinton said Sanders "wants higher standards for toy guns than real guns." Clinton points to the fact that Sanders voted in favor of a 2005 law granting the gun industry certain immunity from lawsuits. In her camp are scholars who believe the law made the gun industry less susceptible to liability than other industries, including the toy gun industry. But other scholars think the law made the gun industry’s liability about the same as that of a toy gun manufacturer. And because real guns carry so much more risk for injury than toy guns, it’s hard to compare them effectively. This is a complex legal question, on which reasonable minds can disagree. Given this disagreement, and the fact that it’s impossible to know how Sanders would vote if a similar legislation concerning the toy industry were to arise, we rate Clinton’s claim Half True.

pomt-05880	"If you take into account all the people who are struggling for work, or have just stopped looking, the real unemployment rate is over 15 percent."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/08/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-broader-measure-national-unemploy/	The last time we rated a Mitt Romney claim on unemployment, we dinged him with a Half True for using a big number without describing it accurately. This time, he got it right. In a speech after winning the Nevada caucuses on Feb. 4, 2012, Romney said, "If you take into account all the people who are struggling for work or have just stopped looking, the real unemployment rate is over 15 percent." That's much more accurate than his statement at the Tampa debate on Jan. 23, when he said that "we have 25 million Americans out of work." We rated that Half True, concluding that Romney had used a valid number but had described it incorrectly. Here’s the background. Every month, the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys a cross-section of Americans to determine, among other things, their employment status. The respondents are characterized as either being in the labor force or out of it. Those who are out of the labor force are not considered as seeking work at present. Some have no intention of working anytime soon -- they may be full-time students, stay-at-home parents, retired or physically unable to work. But others in this category are considered "marginally attached" to the labor force. They want work, are available to work and have looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months -- but by the BLS definition, they do not qualify as being in the labor force because they have not actively searched for work in the previous four weeks. Now let’s look at those considered to be in the labor force. They are categorized as either employed or unemployed. The "employed" group also has a sub-category -- part-timers who would rather be working full-time but who aren’t due to economic conditions. For the best-known unemployment rate figure, the BLS divides the total number of the unemployed (that is, those without jobs who are actively looking for work) by the number of people in the labor force (that is, unemployed workers plus employed workers, both full- and part-time). However, some critics have argued that this definition of unemployment is too limiting. So BLS also offers a broader, alternative measure of "labor underutilization" known as "U-6." It calculates this by dividing the sum of three groups (unemployed, marginally attached to the labor force and working part time for economic reasons) by the sum of the labor force plus marginally attached workers. To make this methodology more concrete, let’s compare how those numbers looked in January 2012, the most recent month available. The regular unemployment rate was 8.3 percent. However, the U-6 rate was significantly higher -- 15.1 percent. The difference stems from the fact that many workers are employed part-time when they’d rather be full-time or have given up looking work, at least for now. (Here's a comparison of various BLS measures.) So Romney is right when he says that "if you take into account all the people who are struggling for work or have just stopped looking, the real unemployment rate is over 15 percent." This is an improvement from his phrasing in the Tampa debate, when he didn’t preface his statistic by noting that he’s referring to the broader, U-6 methodology. A final bit of context: While it’s certainly bad news to have 15.1 percent of the workforce either unemployed or under-employed, it’s worth noting that this statistic, like the more commonly used unemployment rate, is heading in a favorable direction. After rising as high as 17.2 percent in October 2009, the U-6 is now as low as it’s been since February 2009, the second month of Barack Obama’s presidency. That said, this level is still historically high. Since the statistic was first published in 1994, it has only broken into double digits for stretches following two previous recessions -- the recessions that hit in 1990-91 and 2001. And the U-6 peaks for those recessions were 11.8 percent and 10.4 percent, respectively -- well below even today’s improved level. Our ruling While the U-6 measurement is not the official gauge of unemployment in the United States, it’s a valid statistic to consider in conjunction with others. It's true that BLS describes it as a "labor underutilization" rate rather than an "unemployment" rate, since some of the people it counts are part-time workers who aren't officially "unemployed." While this distinction is important to PhD economists, we don't think it's a major problem for a speech made to the general public. In other words, for a general audience, we think "the real unemployment rate" is acceptable shorthand for "the labor underutilization rate," especially when a brief description of the measure is provided. So we rate this claim True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-02-08T15:31:51	2012-02-04	['None']
pomt-06481	"The proudest accomplishment (of my tenure) was leaving the state with a $1.2 billion surplus, which was the largest we’d ever had, and getting spending under control and a balanced budget."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/oct/17/christine-whitman/christie-whitman-says-she-left-state-more-1-billio/	Once upon a time, New Jersey had a surplus in the billions of dollars, according to a former governor. There were surpluses in the state budget and there were surpluses in pension funds. "The proudest accomplishment (of my tenure) was leaving the state with a $1.2 billion surplus, which was the largest we’d ever had, and getting spending under control and a balanced budget," former Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said in a Sept. 19 interview on NJTV. Since she is a governor who has been accused of shortchanging pension contributions to fund tax cuts, PolitiFact New Jersey decided to check her statement. David Rosen, the Legislative Budget and Finance officer for the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, confirmed that Whitman left the state with a $1.2 billion surplus. And at least since 1986 – the first year the state’s budgets are available online – that surplus was the state’s largest, PolitiFact New Jersey found. There have been larger surpluses since she left office. As for balancing the budget? That’s not an accomplishment. State law requires it. But we questioned the part of Whitman’s statement in which she said she controlled spending. Let’s review some of the spending during her tenure. Whitman reduced payments to the state’s pension funds to balance a 30-percent income tax cut enacted after she became governor in 1994. Three years later, Whitman had the state borrow $2.75 billion to deposit in the pension funds to address that liability. The stock market at that time was doing well and the infusion helped create a surplus in the accounts -- for a while. Then the stock market took a downtown. But the pension issue wasn’t the only significant debt during Whitman’s tenure. She also approved an $8.6 billion school construction bill that was largely funded during the Jim McGreevey administration. Taken together, that’s more than $11 billion in debt. Experts, however, told us that governmental standard accounting practices do not include debt in an annual budget. Debt is included in the state’s financial statements, said Richard F. Keevey, who was budget director for former Gov. Jim Florio. Keevey, who teaches public budgeting systems and federal finance at Rutgers Newark, also served as a deputy budget director and budget director for former Gov. Tom Kean. What’s included in the budget is debt service, or the amount paid toward the total debt. Rosen also noted that New Jersey and the country had a strong economy during the Whitman years, from 1994 to Jan. 31, 2001. Whitman left office in the middle of her second gubernatorial term to become administrator at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in Washington, DC. "We were certainly in a surplus position as was the federal government," Rosen said. "Nationally the economy was doing very well and governments generally were doing quite well. Most states had large surpluses, the federal government was in surplus and New Jersey was as well." James DiEleuterio, who was state treasurer from 1994 to 1997, said in an email that Whitman controlled spending by reviewing each of the 32,000 line items in the state budget, cutting unnecessary expenses, streamlining operations and cutting the state’s payroll by 5,000. He also cited the 30 percent tax cut and changes in tax policy that he said improved the state’s economic climate. "Finally, I want to ensure it is clear that Governor Whitman's surplus was not funded by pension funds," DiEleuterio wrote. "Her tax cuts, and subsequent surplus, were funded the only way they should be: with true spending cuts and a balanced budget." Our ruling Whitman says her proudest accomplishment as governor was leaving the state with a more than $1 billion surplus, controlling spending and balancing the budget. Her surplus number is accurate, and two financial experts tell us that basic government accounting principles do not include debt in budgets. Whitman’s former treasurer also claims the governor made traditional spending cuts during her tenure. But how is skipping payments to pension funds controlling spending if those and other bills aren’t being paid in full, or are being deferred to later administrations? We rate Whitman’s claim Mostly True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Christine Whitman	None	None	None	2011-10-17T05:15:00	2011-09-19	['None']
pomt-12568	On whether NATO is "obsolete."	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/12/donald-trump/donald-trump-nato-i-said-it-was-obsolete-its-no-lo/	President Donald Trump seems to have warmed up to NATO, declaring publicly that he no longer thinks the U.S.-European alliance is "obsolete." During the 2016 election, Trump criticized NATO because, he said, member countries aren’t contributing their fair share to the alliance financially, and the organization isn’t designed to fight terrorism. His comments precipitated some concern among the United States’ allies. But months later, during an April 12, 2017, press conference with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Trump affirmed the United States’ commitment to the alliance and praised its seven-decade history. He said NATO is now doing more to fight terrorism, and as a result he no longer thinks the organization is obsolete. "The secretary general and I had a productive conversation about what more NATO can do in the fight against terrorism," Trump said. "I complained about that a long time ago, and they made a change. Now they do fight terrorism. I said it was obsolete. It’s no longer obsolete." That’s a big departure from comments he made on ABC in March 2016: "I think NATO's obsolete. NATO was done at a time you had the Soviet Union, which was obviously larger, much larger than Russia is today. I'm not saying Russia's not a threat. But we have other threats. We have the threat of terrorism and NATO doesn’t discuss terrorism, NATO's not meant for terrorism." However, the premise leading to Trump’s change of heart — the idea that he prompted NATO to start fighting terrorism — is false. He’s talking about the fact that in 2016 NATO created an assistant secretary general for intelligence and security to head a newly established Joint Intelligence and Security Division. Experts said the change was not especially significant, and Trump wasn’t the catalyst. The development had been in the works for years. "It is comical to suggest NATO would change its counterterrorism policy in response to anything Donald Trump has said about it over the course of his campaign," said Matthew Fay, a defense policy analyst with the Niskanen Center, in a prior PolitiFact interview. Further, Trump’s comment gives the incorrect impression that NATO wasn’t responsive to terrorism until the new division was created. In reality, NATO has been actively dealing with terrorism since the 1980s. And since 9/11, it has played a significant role in the War on Terror, including deploying troops in Afghanistan for more than a decade. We should note, though, that experts also told us that NATO’s structure and role has made it an imperfect vehicle for counterterrorism because of problems with coordinating among the member countries. Even before the election was over, Trump hinted that he thinks NATO is making itself more relevant in the fight against terrorism. But at the April press conference he made his change in opinion clear, saying, "I said it was obsolete. It's no longer obsolete." It’s up to voters to decide how they feel about Trump’s reversal on NATO. We rate the change of position a Full Flop.

pomt-09819	"Cap-and-trade is wildly unpopular with Americans."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/03/ibdeditorialscom/ibd-editorial-board-claims-cap-and-trade-unpopular/	The editorial board of Investor's Business Daily says the supporters of a cap-and-trade bill face an uphill battle. In a Sept. 2, 2009, op-ed about the European stake in a climate change bill passed by the House of Representatives, the editors wrote, "Cap-and-trade is wildly unpopular with Americans. No matter how many suave European continentals you send here, it won't change voters' minds." To support their claim, the board included a June 28-29 Rasmussen poll that shows that 56 percent of Americans said they wouldn't pay more taxes to cut greenhouse gases. The question — and the op-ed — leave out the important fact that the bill doesn't impose new taxes (though it's likely people would see higher utility bills as the result of cap-and-trade, which would raise the cost of energy at least slightly). But the claim piqued our interest nevertheless, so we decided to check other polls to see how the plan is playing among voters. The background: Cap-and-trade is a way to slow climate change by reducing carbon emissions. The idea is to cap emissions and require firms to either buy polluting permits or upgrade to cleaner technologies. House lawmakers included such a plan in a bill passed on June 26 that will lower carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. So let's look at how much support it has. A Washington Post /ABC News survey published on June 25, a day before the bill was passed, showed that 75 percent of Americans think the government should regulate greenhouse gas emissions to reduce global warming. About 52 percent support a cap-and-trade program to accomplish that. Opposition has grown to 42 percent, up from 34 percent in the summer of 2008. The same pollsters did a follow-up survey Aug. 13-17 and found that support for cap-and-trade was unchanged. This time, however, the poll provided more detail. About 58 percent said they would support the idea if it raised monthly electric bills by 10 dollars. But when that cost went up to 25 dollars, support dropped to 39 percent. (We've already explored different opinions on how much the legislation might cost, and you can read about them here .) Meanwhile, a Zogby poll published on Aug. 11 found that 71 percent of Americans support the legislation that was passed in the House. It's worth noting that all those numbers are up from polls that were taken earlier in the year, before the bill was debated and passed in the House. For example, in April, a Zogby poll found that 30 percent of respondents supported cap-and-trade. And a CNN poll done one month later found that 44 percent favor a cap-and-trade plan. So, given the most recent polling, it would be fair to say that a slight majority of Americans support cap-and-trade but that those numbers may decrease depending on how much it would cost in higher utility bills. Even so, at its lowest, nearly 40 percent of Americans would still support cap-and-trade even if it meant heftier energy bills. In no case do polling numbers show that cap-and-trade is "wildly unpopular," as the editors of IBD claim, so we give this one a False.

pomt-02462	"A majority of drunk driving deaths and injuries are caused by drunk driving offenders with no prior convictions."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/feb/24/mothers-against-drunk-driving/madd-says-most-drunken-driving-deaths-caused-first/	In assigning Wisconsin one of the lowest grades in the nation in its annual report card, Mothers Against Drunk Driving made an interesting claim about first-time offenders. "‘First-time’ offenders are rarely first-time drunk drivers," said a MADD news release on Feb. 11, 2014. "Conservative estimates show that a first-time convicted OWI offender has driven drunk at least 80 times prior to being arrested." MADD continued: "According to the Wisconsin Department of Transportation, a majority of drunk driving deaths and injuries are caused by drunk driving offenders with no prior convictions." The group spoke out as part of a push for greater use of in-vehicle breath tests, sobriety checkpoints and other measures. Now, we’ve heard state lawmakers argue that drunken-driving remedies should not hammer first-time offenders, who in Wisconsin alone face no criminal liability upon that first conviction. But the MADD national office counters that, saying first timers are involved in a majority of fatal and injury drunken-driving crashes. Are they right? MADD's evidence MADD told us it relied on statements in the "Alcohol Traffic Facts" booklet published in 2003 by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation. While dated, it was the latest such research made public by WisDOT at the time of MADD’s news release -- and it was the best source we could find in researching this item. The WisDOT study found that over a 12-year period from 1991 through 2002, three out of four drivers who had been drinking before a fatal or serious-injury crash had no prior convictions for OWI on their Wisconsin driving record. "Drivers who have previously been convicted of one or more OWI offenses do not comprise the bulk of drivers in fatal and non-fatal serious injury crashes involving drinking and driving," the WisDOT study said. (emphasis theirs) So MADD’s "majority" claim hits the mark, based on the WisDOT research. Beyond the age of the study, there some are other things to bear in mind. First, DOT noted that drivers’ records are not always complete, and that only post-1989 convictions were counted as "prior," under the law at that time. Second, the statistic focused on drivers who had been drinking, a somewhat broader category than the "drunken drivers" in MADD’s claim. Other evidence We found additional evidence generally supporting MADD’s claim, though none of it was directly on point. The best data we saw does not get at who caused these accidents. The Century Council, a distilled spirits trade group, cites 2012 federal government crash data showing that among fatal drunken driving crashes in Wisconsin, 87 percent involved a driver with no prior OWI conviction and 11 percent involved a driver with a prior OWI conviction in the past 3 years. (Three years is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration standard for repeat offender.) That data does not cover injury crashes, though, just fatal crashes. And we note that the NHTSA, the federal agency that collects the data, does not recommend breaking out its data down to the state level. Nationally, NHTSA says, 93 percent of drivers in fatal crashes with a blood-alcohol level of 0.08 or higher had no previous drunken driving conviction in the previous three years. Nina Emerson, a veteran drunken-driving researcher in Wisconsin, studied Wisconsin cases of homicide by intoxicated use, and found that three out of four defendants had no prior drunken-driving conviction. For 20 years, Emerson directed the University of Wisconsin Law Schools Resource Center on Impaired Driving, which closed in 2013 when WisDOT ended its funding. One caution: She defined third offense and beyond as "repeat offenders" because second offense is the first criminal violation in Wisconsin. Emerson and other researchers emphasize an important truth about the research. "By most estimates, although repeat drunk drivers comprise a relatively small proportion of the total population of drivers, they are disproportionately responsible for alcohol-related crashes and other problems associated with drunk driving," Emerson and researchers Michael S. Scott, Nina J. Emerson and Joel B. Plant wrote in a drunken driving guide for the Center for Problem-Oriented Policing. That guide concluded: "However, even though repeat offenders are disproportionately involved in traffic crashes, most alcohol-related crashes are caused by drivers who have not previously been charged with drunk driving, so police must pay attention to both repeat and first-time offenders." Our rating MADD claimed that "a majority of drunk driving deaths and injuries are caused by drunk driving offenders with no prior convictions." While repeat offenders are overrepresented in such crashes compared to their share of the population, it’s clear that a strong majority of such crashes involve first-time offenders under several different definitions of the term. The research doesn't match up perfectly with the language in MADD's claim, but the best numbers are tilted heavily in the group's direction. We rate the claim True.

pomt-00276	John Kerry is "now working on the behalf of foreign terrorist governments."	false	/north-carolina/statements/2018/oct/02/rickey-padgett/republican-candidate-claims-kerry-working-behalf-t/	A day after President Donald Trump slammed former Secretary of State John Kerry for private meetings with a top Iranian official, a North Carolina state Senate candidate lobbed similar accusations in a tweet of his own. "When will the President Strip Former Sec of State of his Security Clearance," said Republican Rickey Padgett, who is running to unseat Democrat Mike Woodard in District 22. "With John Kerry now working on the behalf of foreign terrorist governments (Now) should be the answer. Drain the Swamp now! John Kerry should be next!" Before Trump’s decision in May to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal — which had lifted some economic sanctions on Iran so long as Iran discontinued its pursuit of nuclear weapons — Kerry worked behind the scenes to preserve the pact, according to a May 4 report by the Boston Globe detailing the quiet lobbying efforts as described by anonymous sources. Who has Kerry been meeting with? Specifically, Kerry met with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and made several phone calls to European officials and members of Congress in an effort to rescue the deal. Kerry, who was the nuclear deal’s chief architect under President Barack Obama, said during an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, that he met with Zarif three or four times to discuss the agreement. Kerry’s private meetings have sparked an outcry from congressional Republicans, who say he may have undermined U.S. foreign policy interests. On Sept. 18, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., sent a letter asking the Justice Department to investigate the meetings, according to a press release. Previously, PolitiFact found claims that Kerry met secretly with Iranian officials in Paris to be unsubstantiated. PolitiFact also gave several websites Pants on Fire ratings for false reports that Kerry was facing prison charges under the Logan Act, which prohibits unauthorized American citizens from working to subvert U.S. foreign policy. But Padgett’s claim that Kerry has been "working on the behalf of foreign terrorist governments" seemed particularly sweeping, so we decided to give it a look. When asked for comment, Padgett said he stands by his statement and suggested Kerry has been compromised and should be examined under the Logan Act or brought before the Senate for hearings. "His efforts appear to represent the interests of the Iranian government more than American citizens right here on American soil," Padgett said. "He is part of the previous administration and he should stop trying to ink deals (in the) foreign interest as though he is still part of President Trump’s administration." How normal is this? Kerry spokesman Matthew Summers acknowledged that Kerry has maintained contact with his counterparts from other countries. But he explained that other secretaries of state did the same and that Kerry told Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during a phone conversation earlier this year about the discussions he had with Zarif at international conferences. "At those conferences, (Kerry) urged Iran to keep its commitments under the Iran nuclear agreement," Summers said. "He was advocating for what was wholly consistent with U.S. policy at the time, as the United States was still a part of the Iran deal." David Wade, Kerry’s former chief of staff, also pointed to an email newsletter from Diplomacy Works, a pro-diplomacy organization that includes Kerry on its advisory council, addressing the idea that Kerry’s meetings were secret and illegal. Citing Kerry’s interviews with Hewitt and Fox News host Dana Perino, the email said his meetings with Zarif were routine and occured at a time when the Iran nuclear deal was still U.S. policy. "There’s nothing unusual, let alone unseemly or inappropriate, about former diplomats meeting with foreign counterparts as Secretary Kissinger has done it for decades with Russia and China," Summers said. "But certainly anyone can agree it doesn’t constitute working ‘for’ another country." We consulted some experts, and they agreed. "Of course Kerry did not work on behalf of Iran," said Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. Peter Feaver, a professor of political science at Duke University and a former National Security Council staff member, said there is "nothing unusual or untoward about formers continuing or extending relationships they fostered while in office." "Former national security officials like John Kerry meet with foreign leaders all the time," he said. Feaver said such meetings can be useful for relaying messages back to current policymakers, and that departed diplomats are usually very careful to emphasize that they are not advocating or creating policy. Still, although Kerry’s meetings were fairly standard practice, Feaver noted that it’s not strange that they raised some eyebrows among Republicans. "Based on published reporting, it is possible that former Secretary Kerry’s interactions danced close to the line — a line measuring professional norms, not legal restrictions — in terms of discussing ways to thwart current Administration policy," he said. "The Obama Administration would have been angry if former Bush Administration officials had crossed that line and so it is understandable that the Trump Administration is suspicious of Kerry’s activities." "One can have a good debate about the Logan Act," O’Hanlon added, referring to the law prohibiting unauthorized citizens from working to undermine U.S. policy. Padgett said the government should look into Kerry’s meetings as a potential violation of that statute. How does the Logan Act play into this? But as PolitiFact has noted before, there are only two known instances where Americans have been indicted for violating the Logan Act. The most recent of the two indictments came in 1853, and neither led to a conviction. Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, told the Boston Globe that the act probably would not apply to what Kerry has been up to, even if it was commonly enforced. "If all Kerry is doing is working to keep in place something that’s still technically a ‘measure of the United States,’ I don’t see how the statute would apply even if someone was crazy enough to try it," Vladeck said, according to the Globe. So Kerry may have come close to "a line measuring professional norms," as Feaver said. But his meetings are unlikely to warrant prosecution under the Logan Act, and they certainly did not amount to "working on the behalf of foreign terrorist governments." For the record, Feaver also said the Iranian regime would more precisely be described as "major state sponsors of terrorism," not foreign terrorist governments. Our ruling Padgett said Kerry is "now working on the behalf of foreign terrorist governments." Experts we consulted said that is not the case. Kerry’s meetings with Zarif were not unusual, and there is no clear evidence that his efforts to salvage the Iran deal were undermining current U.S. policy because the meetings occurred before Trump actually moved to scrap the deal, when the deal was still consistent with U.S. policy. More to the point, there is no evidence that Kerry has been in cahoots with or working for Iran. We rate Padgett’s statement False.

pomt-09958	A public option for health care would end private insurance "because the private insurance people will not be able to compete with a government option."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/19/mitch-mcconnell/some-private-health-insurance-can-surviv/	With high-profile support from President Barack Obama, Congress is preparing a major overhaul of the nation's health care system. The details have yet to be revealed, but that hasn't stopped critics in Congress from going on the attack. Obama and the Democratic leadership have proposed broad outlines for the overhaul. The centerpiece of their plan remains the employer-based system, where most people have private health insurance through work. To rein in costs, the government would invest in electronic medical records and encourage efficiency and preventive care. To get coverage for people who don't have health insurance, the plan would increase eligibility for the poor and children to enroll in initiatives like Medicaid and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program. Finally, the plans seek to create a health insurance exchange, where individuals and small businesses can easily comparison shop for insurance coverage. One of the exchange plans would be a public option run by the government. It's the public option that has fueled Republican attacks. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said on Fox News Sunday that a public option would destroy the private insurance system. It "would mean a government plan that would inevitably put the government between you and your doctor, and there would be no more private insurance," McConnell said. Asked why by interviewer Chris Wallace, McConnell said, "Because the private insurance people will not be able to compete with a government option." McConnell is incorrect — the Democratic plan does not intend to do away with private insurance. His statement that private insurance "will not be able to compete with a government option" is challenged by nonpartisan health care experts who disagree. McConnell's view is that if the government offers a cheaper, public plan, people will dump their private insurance to get lower health care premiums. Over time, this would errode the private health care system. In theory, it makes sense that people would want the health plan that saves them the most money, and experts do say some private insurance companies might struggle to survive against a government competitor. In practice, however, researchers don't believe public options would destroy the private insurance industry. "Every time I hear these claims I'm astonished," said Cathy Schoen, senior vice president for the Commonwealth Fund, a foundation that studies health care and advocates more coverage for the uninsured, minorities and people with low incomes. She said a public plan could pressure private insurers to lower premiums or negotiate better rates with hospitals, but it would not put private companies out of business. "The public plan could get a reputation of not being good. The private plans could say, 'Let's change our behavior so we don't lose business,'" Schoen said. Another nonpartisan research group, the Urban Institute, reached similar conclusions. "Private plans would not disappear. Private plans that offer better services and greater access to providers, even at somewhat higher costs than the public plans, would survive the competition in this environment," wrote John Holahan and Linda Blumberg of the Urban Institute's Health Policy Center. One of the problems right now is that private insurance is not as competitive as you might think. Both the Commonwealth Fund and the Urban Insitute have noted that most health care markets are dominated by a small number of big insurers. "The increased concentration has made it difficult for the nation to reap the benefits usually associated with competitive markets," Holahan and Blumberg wrote. Not that a public option will solve all problems. They concluded that a public plan is not sufficient to control growing health care costs, and that other cost-containment strategies would be necessary. Finally, we should point out that it remains to be seen how the Democratic plan will deal with the public option, which could be structured in several different ways. McConnell flatly states that the public option would run private plans out business because they "will not be able to compete with a government option." Even though we have limited details on how the plan would be implemented, there is enough in the administration proposal to conclude that McConnell's worst-case scenario is unlikely. That brings us to Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05553	Under the House Republican budget, "if these cuts were to be spread out evenly … the year after next, nearly 10 million college students would see their financial aid cut by an average of more than $1,000 each."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/06/barack-obama/president-barack-obama-says-gop-budget-cuts-financ/	Welcome to the Budget Games. The strategy: Offer a proposal with broad outlines and as little detail as possible. When opponents attack, declare, "That’s not what our budget does!" Meanwhile, fill in missing details in the other guy’s budget with the least flattering interpretation you can calculate. Repeat. President Barack Obama filled in some details of the GOP budget resolution passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in a speech to a meeting of news executiveson April 3, 2012 — using his own assumptions. "This new House Republican budget ... proposes massive new cuts in annual domestic spending — exactly the area where we’ve already cut the most. And I want to actually go through what it would mean for our country if these cuts were to be spread out evenly. So bear with me. I want to go through this — because I don’t think people fully appreciate the nature of this budget. "The year after next, nearly 10 million college students would see their financial aid cut by an average of more than $1,000 each." He went on, listing nearly a dozen specific ways the plan from House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan would cut programs — again, assuming cuts were evenly spread. Then he clarified that Republicans "don’t specify exactly the cuts they would make." Still, he doubles down on his list: "This is not conjecture. I am not exaggerating. These are facts. And these are just the cuts that would happen the year after next." We thought we would start by asking: Is that true? If cuts were spread evenly, would nearly 10 million college students see their aid cut by more than $1,000 each? The Pell Grant program We asked the White House to explain Obama’s math. We talked to the House Budget Committee, looked through the budget documents and reached out to other budget experts. The House Budget Committee says such a claim about college aid cuts is simply false. More on that in a minute. Obama’s claim relies on funding in the Ryan plan for federal Pell Grants. The program provides the largest source of grant funding for needy college students, with more than 9.7 million students expected to get grants worth up to $5,635 in 2013, according to the Education Department. It goes without saying that’s the only way some students might afford to go to college. But the costs of the program have been soaring, with discretionary costs more than doubling since 2008, according to the Education Department — mostly because there are more eligible students. House Republicans accompanied the budget with a report that spells out ways to rein in the Pell program. For example, keeping the Pell maximum grant award in 2013 at this year's level of $5,550. The House Budget Committee says it would stay at that level for the full 10 years of the budget, key to the argument that Obama’s claim is false, though that's not clear in the report. But there’s disagreement between the House Budget Committee and the White House Office of Management and Budget over how seriously to take House recommendations that aren’t in the actual budget resolution. In the absence of direction from the budget resolution, OMB says it’s justified in applying the Republican budget’s cuts to nondefense discretionary spending across the board, leading to Obama’s statement that "if these cuts were to be spread out evenly … the year after next, nearly 10 million college students would see their financial aid cut by an average of more than $1,000 each." The Ryan plan Let’s be clear about what a budget resolution actually is — merely a guidance document for policymakers. "Even in places where it makes assumed cuts to get to its budget numbers, it doesn't actually have the ability to force them to happen," said Steve Ellis, vice president for Taxpayers for Common Sense. House committees propose legislation to do that. Still, the budget passed by the House on March 29, 2012, provides an outline. What does it say about Pell Grant funding? Nothing. But the accompanying House Budget Committee report on the budget resolution offers a series of "illustrative options" to achieve its savings, saying, "The committees of jurisdiction will make final policy determinations." The suggestions include requiring that students attend school at least half-time and changing the maximum income limit to be eligible. (It doesn’t actually specify what that new limit might be. Jason Delisle, an education budget expert at the New America Foundation, has made some guesses.) Among those suggestions: "To get program costs back to a sustainable level, the budget recommends a maximum award of $5,550." It says the award would be fully funded through discretionary, rather than mandatory, spending. (That means an even bigger funding crunch in a shrinking pool of discretionary dollars.) Moira Mack, spokeswoman for the OMB, points out that recommendation isn’t included in the actual budget resolution passed by the House — which does include policy statements on big issues such as Medicare and Social Security. Meanwhile, she says, the report isn’t clear about whether the maximum applies just to the coming year or to the entire 10-year-window covered by the budget. (The language just before the "illustrative options" is specific to fiscal year 2013.) So the OMB calculates that the Ryan budget keeps the maximum grant at $5,550 in 2013 only. In 2014, the budget’s 14.3 percent cut in nondefense discretionary spending from the year before — applied evenly to the Pell program — would push the maximum award amount down to to $4,595 and leave some students with nothing at all, with an average cut of more than $1,000 per student. (The president’s budget doesn’t clarify how it cuts spending in order to increase the maximum award — but compared with Ryan’s plan, there’s more funding available for nondefense discretionary spending, such as Pell grants.) Budget experts at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities made a calculation similar to Obama's. "The $1,000 was in the range of what we estimate would happen if you eliminated the mandatory funding and made a few other policy changes but did not significantly reduce the number of people who are eligible," said James Horney, vice president for federal fiscal policy. It’s just as possible that lawmakers could reduce eligibility, rather than cut the maximum award — leading to a different sort of statistic. Say, "Millions of students would lose access to the Pell Grant program." Or lawmakers could choose to protect both eligibility and the $5,550, leading to bigger cuts in other programs. So is Obama’s math fair? Ellis, of Taxpayers for Common Sense, says it’s tricky to say. "Averaging cuts isn't an accurate way to describe what a budget does," he said. "That said, the budget is not that prescriptive, so saying it wouldn't lead to something being cut is hard to argue as well." But that’s precisely what the House Budget Office argues. "Our budget ensures that we maintain the current maximum Pell award," said Gerrit Lansing, press secretary for the House Budget Committee, sustaining the 2012 award amount in the Ryan plan for 10 years. "... Yet again, the president has made assumptions about our budget that can't be sourced to our budget. The president is arguing: 'While Ryan doesn't assume X, let's just say he does so that I can get my talking point to work.'" William McBride, an economist at the business-backed Tax Foundation, echoes that idea, saying, "As far as I know, there is no clear basis for the president’s claim. There is nothing in the Ryan budget that would suggest that. The burden of proof is with the president." Roberton Williams, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, says there simply isn’t enough detail in the Ryan plan to say how it might affect people when it’s all in place. And in that case, estimating cuts across the board is reasonable. Delisle, the education funding expert at the New America Foundation, developed his own set of assumptions to evaluate the Ryan plan’s effect on Pell funding. "The Ryan budget doesn't truly reveal what it's doing … which gives the Obama administration a lot of latitude to assume something radical," he said. Our ruling Obama declared in his speech to news media that in the absence of information about cuts in the Ryan plan, he would extrapolate what might happen if those cuts were applied evenly across programs. He included such a detail about Pell Grants, saying "the year after next, nearly 10 million college students would see their financial aid cut by an average of more than $1,000 each." To his credit, Obama clarified that Republicans didn’t specify those cuts themselves and that they might apply cuts in ways other than the president assumed. But he hurts himself when he engages in a detailed analysis based on his own assumptions and then declares, "This is not conjecture." Budget experts tell us that applying cuts evenly in the absence of other information is fair, assuming he’s clear about what he’s doing. But Obama's figure was based on the assumption that savings would be achieved by, among other things, reducing the maximum grant level in 2013 and beyond. The problem is, House Republicans say that their report expresses a preference to maintain a maximum award of $5,550. But that preference isn’t in the budget resolution passed by the House. The president's statement is accurate using his set of assumptions, but his assumptions ignore a preference that House Republicans say was reflected in the report accompanying the Ryan budget — that Pell grant maximums not be reduced beyond 2013. And, if other means were used to reduce spending on Pell Grants, such as lowering income eligibility, the impact could be different. Those are important details to leave out, which leads us to a rating of Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-04-06T16:34:55	2012-04-03	['None']
pomt-07835	Since Sept. 11, 2001, "270,000 Americans were killed by gunfire at home."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/14/doonesbury/doonesbury-strip-says-270000-americans-have-been-k/	In the Sunday, Feb. 13, 2011, installment of the comic strip Doonesbury, Mark Slackmeyer -- a longtime character in the strip who is a liberal radio host -- makes a point about gun violence. "What are we like as a people?" Slackmeyer muses to himself in his studio. "Nine years, ago we were attacked -- 3,000 people died. In response, we started two long, bloody wars and built a vast homeland-security apparatus -- all at a cost of trillions! Now consider this. During those same nine years, 270,000 Americans were killed by gunfire at home. Our response? We weakened our gun laws." At that point, a whirring sound comes from off-panel. In the final panel, we see that his guest is a space alien, who says, "Fail. Cannot Comprehend." To which Slackmeyer cracks, "Well, you may be a little jet-lagged." A reader asked us to fact-check it. So we’ll look at whether since Sept. 11, 2001, "270,000 Americans were killed by gunfire at home." We began by contacting Garry Trudeau, the cartoonist who has drawn Doonesbury for more than four decades. He got back immediately with a summary of his methodology. "The final figure lacks precision, because it's extrapolated," Trudeau wrote us, noting, correctly, that the most recent data for gun deaths from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is from 2007. "What I had were six years -- 2002-2007 -- of a remarkably stable number, around 30,000" gun deaths per year, Trudeau wrote. "So in my judgment, multiplying 30,000 times nine yielded a figure reasonable and accurate enough for rhetorical purposes without using hyperbole. If anything, it may be slightly on the low side." We found that Trudeau was basically right. We went to the same CDC database he used -- the Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (or WISQARS for short) -- and got virtually identical numbers. Our number came out slightly higher -- 281,757 -- because we not only extrapolated out through the end of 2010 in our calculations but also included the final three months of 2001. We should note the details of Trudeau’s definition of gun deaths, which is also the definition we would have used if we’d been starting from scratch. It includes the following categories: • Suicides: 102,002 between 2002 and 2007 • Homicides: 73,148 between 2002 and 2007 • Accidental: 4,185 between 2002 and 2007 • Legal shootings: 1,999 between 2002 and 2007 • Undetermined: 1,427 between 2002 and 2007 -- Total: 182,761 between 2002 and 2007 So on the numbers, Trudeau’s methodology was accurate. The only thing that threw us was how the strip had described where the deaths occurred -- "270,000 Americans were killed by gunfire at home" (our emphasis). Initially, we took that to mean that 270,000 Americans were literally killed in or near their homes. And we knew that couldn’t be right, because the number both we and Trudeau calculated included all gunfire deaths, wherever they had occurred. When we asked criminologists for guidance on what percentage of gun deaths occur at home, they said the statistics on that question are scattershot. James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University, provided data on Chicago homicides from an amicus brief he wrote for a Supreme Court case. Since 1965, the ratio of outside-the-home handgun homicides in Chicago to those occurring at home has tended to bounce around from about two-to-one in the 1970s to about five-to-one in the 1990s. So if one interprets "at home" to mean in or near someone’s home, the numbers Trudeau calculated wouldn’t be correct. When we raised this point with Trudeau, he said that wasn’t what he meant: "I didn't say ‘in the home,’ I said ‘at home’ as opposed to abroad, where the wars are. Failure to communicate clearly, I guess. Rats." Reading through it again, we think Trudeau’s explanation sounds reasonable. But we decided to mark Trudeau down slightly because we think it’s also reasonable for people to make the same initial assumption we did, that "at home" means in or near one’s home. So we’ll rate the comment Mostly True.	None	Doonesbury	None	None	None	2011-02-14T15:41:08	2011-02-13	['United_States']
pomt-06633	"Two-thirds of Granite Staters oppose the Tea Party" and its agenda on labor unions.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/16/new-hampshire-democratic-party/democrats-say-majority-new-hampshire-residents-do-/	The New Hampshire primary has many fine traditions: house parties in cramped farmhouse parlors; town hall meetings with substantive questions from well-informed voters; and icy storms that punish Washington-based reporters who thought duck boots were a crime against fashion. Yet another tradition is sniping from state party officials who try to inflict a little collateral damage on the other team’s candidates, especially the front-runners. Such is the case with New Hampshire Democratic Party chairman Ray Buckley, whose team of operatives has been especially focused on Republican Mitt Romney, who proved in his 2002 gubernatorial victory in Massachusetts that he can appeal to suburban, independent voters. When Romney earlier this month decided to attend a Tea Party Express event in Concord, Buckley issued a news release deriding "Mitt Romney’s Official Tea Party Debut." "The Tea Party does not represent the majority of Granite Staters," Buckley asserted. "This is evidenced by the Tea Party-backed State House Republicans here, who in only nine months have amounted to one of the most unpopular legislatures in New Hampshire's history. "Two-thirds of Granite Staters oppose the Tea Party and Romney’s Right to Work for Less agenda, and even more oppose the GOP plan to end Medicare as we know it." For this fact-check, we're examining Buckley's claim that two-thirds oppose the tea party and its support for a controversial "right-to-work" bill in Concord. Considering that tea party voters helped fuel a huge Republican victory in New Hampshire legislative races in 2010, Buckley’s statement, if true, would indicate a rather abrupt change of heart. Asked for backup for Buckley’s claim, New Hampshire Democratic Party spokeswoman Holly Shulman cited a New Hampshire Tea Party website that strongly endorses legislation that would weaken unions’ clout by preventing them from collecting dues or fees from nonmembers covered by union contracts. She also cited polls by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center that show strong support for the right to collectively bargain. There is no doubt that the New Hampshire Tea Party Coalition news release for a May 25, 2011, rally identifies the "right to work" bill as "the most important piece of legislation for the future health of the New Hampshire economy that will be considered in this session or any other session." And Romney, does, indeed, support "right-to-work" laws, and has specifically spoken in favor of the GOP bill in Concord, which would end a practice allowing union contracts to include a clause requiring non-union workers to pay a share of collective bargaining costs. New Hampshire Gov. John Lynch, a Democrat, vetoed the bill, and supporters have been unable to muster an override. But there are two major issues with Buckley’s claim: First, it suggests that two-thirds of New Hampshire voters oppose the tea party, not just its agenda on labor issues. And secondly, it distorts what is known about public opinion on the union issue. Polls show Buckley is correct in saying the tea party doesn’t represent "the majority" of Granite Staters, but to suggest that two-thirds oppose the group is a big stretch. UNH Survey Center director Andrew Smith said his group’s most recent poll, in July 2011, showed that 27 percent of New Hampshire adults supported the tea party, 35 percent were opposed, and 38 percent were neutral or said they didn’t know. "This has been pretty consistent for the past year," he said by e-mail. Shulman also referred PolitiFact to a New York Times/CBS News poll on Aug. 5, 2011, and wrote, "Recent national polls show the tea party is very unpopular." That national poll, incidentally, found 20 percent of Americans with a favorable view of the tea party, 40 percent unfavorable, and 39 percent saying they were either undecided or hadn’t heard enough about the group. But Smith told us that opinion on the tea party in New Hampshire tracks closely along political affiliation -- support among Republicans, opposition among Democrats, and mixed opinion among independents, with more than 50 percent of them neutral about the group. "I can see what (the Democrats) are trying to do, but I don’t think that saying that two-thirds of people in New Hampshire oppose the tea party accurately reflects public opinion," Smith said. He also takes some exception with how Buckley’s team is characterizing the polling data on unions. The UNH Survey Center poll in May, which Democrats cited, asked respondents whether public- and private-sector workers should have the right to form unions and negotiate pay and benefits. And, indeed, there is support for unionization on that front in both sectors. Sixty-six percent of respondents said workers should have the right to unionize, with only 20 percent opposed, and the numbers for government workers, specifically, weren’t much different. But Smith said his polling specifically avoided using "right to work," which refers to laws outlawing compulsory dues paying. Using the phrase "right to work," Smith said, "doesn’t accurately reflect" what his poll question asked. Our ruling Buckley said "Two-thirds of Granite Staters oppose the Tea Party" and its agenda on labor unions. But UNH polls show the opposition to the tea party is about 35 percent, about half as much as Buckley says. And while New Hampshire voters support the right to form unions and negotiate, the polls Democrats cite don’t ask about the also contentious issue of compulsory union dues. We rate Buckley's claim Mostly False.	None	New Hampshire Democratic Party	None	None	None	2011-09-16T13:51:10	2011-09-04	['None']

We’re facing an existential threat," he said. "ISIS is running through the border made porous by Barack Obama’s policies." ISIS has seized vast territory in Iraq and Syria wielding heavy weapons of war. It terrorizes civilians and broadcasts footage of sadistic executions. Does it also operate over the 1,254-mile Texas-Mexico border? Rumor says they do, though we’ve found previous claims short of factual footing. In October 2014, we rated False then-Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst’s claim that prayer rugs had been found at the border, suggesting an ISIS presence. The same month, we rated False a claim by U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter that 10 ISIS fighters had been caught at the border. In April 2015, we rated False a report by conservative watchdog Judicial Watch stating that ISIS was running a camp in Mexico just over the border from El Paso. Most recently, in December 2015 we rated Mostly False Abbott’s claim that Texas had seen three ISIS-related incidents, finding his definition of "ISIS-related" extremely loose. So, here we go again. Abbott’s data Abbott, who in 2015 touted and signed into law the state’s $800 million border security package, offered his declaration as proof of the urgency of his border security agenda and as a jab at the immigration policies of the Democratic president’s administration, over which then-Attorney General Abbott filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of Texas and more than 20 other mostly Republican-led states in 2014. It alleged the president exceeded his constitutional authority when he used executive action to shield certain young adults and parents from deportation. In April 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court heard the Texas-led challenge to the Obama administration’s policy; a ruling could come this year. We emailed Abbott spokesman John Wittman to ask when ISIS ran through the border, and also which Obama policies had made the border more porous, as Abbott said. Regarding the porous border, Wittman sent a link to the 2014 lawsuit filed by Attorney General Abbott. "A specific policy which has made the border more porous," Wittman wrote. Regarding ISIS, Wittman provided a web link, tweeted by Abbott on April 23, 2016, to a Fox News Latino article published the day before. The news story, citing prosecutorial documents, said a 21-year-old Minnesota man charged with conspiracy to join ISIS "told the ISIS members about the route (‘to the U.S. through Mexico’) so that it could be used to send members to America to carry out terrorist attacks." ISIS at the gates For our part, we looked first for signs of ISIS border crossings, then considered Abbott’s charge about Obama fostering a porous border. Abbott’s backup did not say, as the governor did, that ISIS was operating at the border, but we still made inquiries. At the Department of Homeland Security, the parent agency for border security, including the U.S. Border Patrol, spokeswoman Marsha Catron emailed in reply: "The suggestion that (ISIS) operatives have been apprehended at the Southwest border is not supported by facts on the ground. DHS does not have any credible intelligence that terrorist organizations are planning to attempt to cross the southwest border to carry out attacks in the United States." We also emailed the Texas Department of Public Safety, which patrols the border, to ask for any reports of ISIS activity thereabouts.DPS spokesman Tom Vinger emailed: "The department does not have any information to provide." In the past, groups or individuals bandying similar claims alleged that law enforcement agencies suppress news of ISIS at the border to avoid public panics. That in mind, we also queried experts outside of government. By phone, we asked Victor M. Manjarrez, director of the National Center for Border Security & Immigration at the University of Texas at El Paso, if ISIS was operating at the border. Manjarrez, a former Border Patrol sector chief, said, "no," adding that every report of ISIS at the border has been debunked. We thought perhaps there are reports Manjarrez hadn’t seen, so we looked elsewhere. At the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington D.C.-based think tank which focuses partly on border security and international terrorism, we were referred to Rick Nelson, former director of the center’s Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Program, who said in a phone interview he knew of no reports of ISIS at the border. Nelson said: "There’s no doubt that if ISIS had the opportunity, they would conduct an attack in the U.S., but to state that they’re going to do so by going through Mexico and going through the southern border is a little bit disconnected." He said the group was more focused on radicalizing Americans already in the country. We also emailed the RAND Corporation, a California-based think tank focused partly on national security, to ask about reports of ISIS at the border. By phone, Colin Clarke, a political scientist and national security research at RAND, said: "I haven’t seen any evidence that there are ISIS people coming across the border. My standard response is I haven’t seen the evidence, but that doesn’t mean that at some point they won’t try that." Clarke said ISIS would need a domestic network of safe houses and weapons stashes to wage a significant attack, even if members were to come across the border. So, no confirmed ISIS sightings. We looked next at if the border has become "porous" on Obama’s watch, as Abbott said. Border Patrol spending up, apprehensions down There are no signs of a more porous border that we divined. When we asked Nelson at the CSIS to what extent border security had decreased under Obama, he said, "I would say it hasn’t." He said, "The amount of resources Obama has put forward to secure the border has been significant." On Obama’s watch, federal figures suggest, border security spending and staffing escalated and, in the latest full fiscal year, 2015, apprehensions of individuals crossing the border without legal authority declined in comparison to the three previous years. Some perspective: --The congressionally approved $3.8 billion fiscal 2015 budget for the Border Patrol, the on-the-ground border enforcement unit of Customs and Border Protection,was up an inflation-adjusted 29 percent from fiscal 2009, the year Obama succeeded George W. Bush. --The 17,522 Border Patrol agents in 2015 were up a sliver, less than 1 percent, from 2009, though down 6 percent from the all-time high of 18,611 agents in 2013. --Apprehensions along the southwest border escalated in 2013 and 2014, according to Border Patrol data, but the 331,333 apprehensions near the border in fiscal 2015 were the fewest since 2011--and down 39 percent compared to 2009. Also worth noting: Deportations from the U.S. hit a record high under Obama in 2013, the year before the surge, according to Pew Research. Obama policies? Abbott’s lawsuit, which Wittman cited as backup, identified two Obama policies: Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), announced in 2012, and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA), unveiled in 2014. DACA blocked deportation for qualified unauthorized immigrants who arrived as children and DAPA did the same for parents of qualified citizens and permanent residents. The lawsuit predicted that both moves would "substantially increase the number of undocumented immigrants in the plaintiff states" because "the removal of the deportation threat, combined with the incentives to stay, will make remaining in the United States far more attractive." We asked Manjarrez if DACA and DAPA made the border more porous. "I wouldn’t say porous, I’d say it’s increased the clutter," he said. "Some people translate that to more porous, I say the border is now at a higher risk to be exploited by some interest." For instance, he said that many children who arrived amid a surge in 2014-2015 cited rumors that they would not be deported as a motivation for their trips to the border. The increased "clutter" at the border, he said, made it harder for Border Patrol agents to pinpoint security threats. We’ve looked before into claims that Obama policies fueled the migrant surge. At the time, experts and news reports gave more credit to rising violence in Central American countries and to a 2008 law passed under Bush shielding non-Mexican children from immediate deportation when apprehended at the border. Abbott again We shared our findings--no confirmation of ISIS on the border and statistics suggesting a greater security presence--with the governor’s office. Wittman said Abbott had nothing to add. Our ruling Abbott said "ISIS is running through the border made porous by Barack Obama’s policies." We found no factual basis — Abbott offered none — to support the claim that ISIS is "running through" the border. Other claims of ISIS forces marshaling on the U.S.-Mexico border have been debunked, and this one deserves the same fate. Border security itself has been stepped up, by the federal government and Texas, with apprehensions lately on the decline. Abbott’s claim isn’t just wrong, it’s ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-00279	"Since NAFTA’s adoption, the United States racked up trade deficits totaling more than $2 trillion."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/01/donald-trump/has-us-racked-2-trillion-trade-deficits-nafta-bega/	During a press event to announce a successor trade pact to the North American Free Trade Agreement, President Donald Trump sought to portray NATFA as a disaster for American trade. "Since NAFTA’s adoption, the United States racked up trade deficits totaling more than $2 trillion," Trump said at the Oct. 1, 2018, event at the White House. (Watch it at about the 20:00 mark.) Is that true? We turned to data for trade in goods with Canada and Mexico published by the U.S. Census Bureau. We totaled up the trade surpluses or deficits with each country between 1994 — the year the agreement was signed — and 2017, the last full year for which data is available. (Reminder: A trade surplus means that exports exceed imports; a trade deficit means that imports exceed exports. It doesn’t literally mean the United States lost $2 trillion.) Here’s the year-by-year summary of the balance of trade of goods with both countries. With one exception, they were all annual deficits. (Mexico is marked in red, while Canada is marked in blue.) See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com If you add it all up, the accumulated U.S. trade deficit with both countries in goods between 1994 and 2017 was $1.97 trillion. Rounded up, that’s $2 trillion. But it’s not a fully comprehensive description. These figures are for goods only — not for goods and services. When Trump has talked as president about trade statistics, he has often referred to the deficit for goods only. That paints the United States’ trade position in a worse light than If the calculation had included services (such as legal or accounting services). We couldn’t find data on services all the way back to 1994, but we’ll use data for 2015, 2016 and 2017 for a sense of how the numbers differ. In each of those years, the United States erased its modest trade deficit in goods with Canada by running a trade surplus in services. The impact of services on the trade balance with Mexico was smaller, but the trade deficit with Mexico typically shrank when services were included. Second, Trump uses this statistic to emphasize the negative impact of NAFTA while minimizing the positive impact. NAFTA certainly had negative aspects for the United States. We recently rated a Trump statement that "we lost thousands of plants" due to NAFTA Mostly True. Still, the agreement has had positive impacts as well. For instance, NAFTA increased the amount of U.S. exports to both countries, which in turn produced jobs that didn’t exist before. Here’s a chart showing the level of U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico in 1994 and 2017. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com "There are volume benefits to trade under NAFTA," said Ross Burkhart, a political scientist specializing in U.S.-Canada relations at Boise State University. "Exports across NAFTA are one of them. Across the vast majority of U.S. states, Canada remains the No. 1 trading partner both in exports and imports." It’s also worth noting that the concept of "exports" and "imports" between NAFTA-member countries has blurred, since partially assembled goods often cross the Canada-U.S. border several times before the final product is assembled, especially in the automobile sector. "If Ford used to ship engines from a parts plant in Dearborn, Mich., to one in Ypsilanti, Mich., but it now ships those parts to Monterey, Mexico, for assembly into a car or truck that is shipped back to the United States (and if the Ypsilanti assembly plant has closed), then the increase in exports to Mexico has not supported any new jobs," said Robert E. Scott, senior economist and director of trade and manufacturing policy research at the Economic Policy Institute, which is skeptical of trade agreements. Various independent estimates have found that the net job losses from NAFTA were modest, with the gains roughly offsetting losses. In general, experts who are favorable to free trade say that arguing over deficits and surpluses misses the point. Specifically, trade deficits stem from demand among U.S. consumers for products that U.S. producers cannot meet, whether that’s because no American company makes the product in question, because American companies aren’t making the product cheaply enough, or because U.S.-produced wares simply aren’t appealing enough to consumers. "We should be running deficits with some countries and surpluses with others, since comparative advantage will vary, country by country," I.M. (Mac) Destler, who teaches at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy, has told us previously. Our ruling Trump said, "Since NAFTA’s adoption, the United States racked up trade deficits totaling more than $2 trillion." The trade deficit is different from the national debt in that it is not money owed to another country in the future. But if you compile the trade deficit for goods alone, Trump is on target. The amount might be smaller once services are factored in. It’s worth noting that this statistic emphasizes the negative impacts of the trade deal but ignores positive impacts, such as significant increases in U.S. exports to both countries.

pomt-08612	"Our tax rates are lower now than they were under Ronald Reagan. They're much lower than they were under Dwight Eisenhower."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/22/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-taxes-are-lower-today-under-reag/	CORRECTION: The original version of this story misstated some of the income thresholds that qualified a taxpayer for the top rate. For individuals today, the top rate kicks in at $373,650, rather than $186,825. In 1981, the top rate of 70 percent kicked in at $108,300 rather than $107,100. In 1988, the top rate of 28 percent kicked in at $17,850 for individuals (rather than $113,300) and at $29,750 for married couples (rather than $149,250). Today, those incomes would be equivalent to $33,229 and $55,382 respectively. We had already argued in our assessment that 1988 was the one year where Obama’s comparison was inaccurate, which is why we rated his comment Mostly True rather than True. The corrected numbers do not invalidate that conclusion, so we are keeping our rating. A blog post at Media Matters for America, a liberal group, argued that the premise of our comparison was misleading, since we only compared the the top tax rates. We agree that a comparison of all tax brackets would have an advantage over a look at just the top brackets. But as we indicated in the story, comparing a dozen or more income ranges -- each of which need to be adjusted for inflation -- over a series of nearly 20 separate tax years is a complicated process, and we were not convinced that Obama had actually intended to make the more detailed comparison. So we compared just the top rate. Others are free to make the alternative calculations, but we believe we’ve used a valid methodology. (March 1, 2011) *** During a Sept. 20, 2010, town hall televised on CNBC, President Barack Obama made a pointed comparison involving taxation under his presidency. "Our tax rates are lower now than they were under Ronald Reagan," Obama said. "They're much lower than they were under Dwight Eisenhower." We thought that claim was worth a run through the Truth-O-Meter. The most obvious way to make the comparison is to use income tax rates paid by people in various tax brackets. Due to the complexity of comparing a dozen or more income ranges that each need to be adjusted for inflation, economists most frequently compare just the top rate. First, we'll look at the tax rates, using a convenient historical guide published by the Tax Foundation, an independent tax research group. The tables go as far back as the dawn of the income tax in 1913. Today, the top income tax rate is 35 percent, starting at $373,650 for individuals and couples. By contrast, during the eight years of the Eisenhower presidency, the top rate averaged roughly 90 percent, typically hitting individuals making $200,000 a year or couples making $400,000 a year. In 2010 dollars, that's equivalent to $1.6 million for an individual and $3.2 million for a couple. Someone making the 1954 equivalent of $373,650 in today's money would have paid a tax rate of 72 percent back then. So by this measure, Obama's comparison with Eisenhower earns a True. Now for Ronald Reagan. In 1981, Reagan's first year, the top tax rate was 70 percent, hitting individuals earning $108,300 and couples earning $215,400. The top rate dropped immediately to 50 percent in 1982 and stayed there through 1986. In 1987, the top rate fell again to 38.5 percent, and in 1988, it fell to 28 percent, kicking in at $17,850 for married individuals and $29,750 for married couples. (The 1988 incomes would be equivalent to $33,229 and $55,382 today.) So, for one year of the Reagan presidency, the top rate was lower than it is now under Obama. For the other seven years, it was higher. For the Reagan comparison, we rate Obama's statement Mostly True. But we'll add a few caveats. The first is that looking at the top income tax rate offers an incomplete look at overall tax policy because it only looks at income taxes, not at other levies such as payroll, sales and property taxes. This is not a trivial difference: According to the Tax Foundation, more than two-thirds of all taxes paid by Americans in 2010 will be something other than income taxes. There is another way -- calculating all taxes paid by Americans and dividing the sum by the nation's total income. To make this calculation, we turned to the Tax Foundation's annual "Tax Freedom Day" report, which offers calculations of total tax burden going back to 1900. (There was no federal income tax then, but there were state and other taxes.) The foundation's expected tax burden for 2010 is 26.9 percent, up slightly from the 2009 tax burden of 26.6 percent. (This is not unusual: The tax burden typically falls during recessions, as taxpayers move to lower tax brackets.) Under Eisenhower, that figure ranged from 24.8 percent to 27.7 percent, with the figure lower than 26.9 percent for seven out of eight years. So by this measurement, the tax burden was lower most of the time under Eisenhower. Under Reagan, it ranged from 29.2 percent to 31.1 percent, meaning that in all eight years it was higher than the current tax burden under Obama. Still, Obama did speak of "tax rates," not "taxes" or "tax burdens," so we'll stick to the tax bracket comparison in making our ruling. The second caveat we'll mention is that conservatives say it's inappropriate for Obama to claim credit for lower taxes. They note that today's tax rates were established by his Republican predecessor, George W. Bush. In fact, they say, it is Obama's stated intention to increase taxes on individuals earning $200,000 and couples earning $250,000, which would push the top tax bracket to 39.6 percent. They also note (as we have, in giving him a Promise Broken on the Obameter) that the president has already signed into law several tax increases. He hiked the levy on cigarettes; imposed tax penalties on people without insurance; taxed tanning services, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and raised Medicare tax rates for upper-income individuals. (Not all of these taxes kick in immediately.) We think it's fair to note that Obama has raised taxes and promises to do so again. But we don't think that undermines the factual accuracy of his statement from the town hall. If you make the comparison using tax brackets -- which we think was Obama's clear intent -- then the president is right when comparing today's rates to Eisenhower's, and he's close to right when he makes the comparison to Reagan. On balance, we rate Obama's statement Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2010-09-22T10:03:29	2010-09-20	['Dwight_D._Eisenhower', 'Ronald_Reagan']
pomt-03843	The transportation package passed by the General Assembly would impose the "largest tax increase in Virginia’s history."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2013/mar/15/jamie-radtke/jamie-radtke-says-transportation-bill-would-impose/	Gov. Bob McDonnell stands accused of sanctioning the biggest tax hike in Virginia history. The charge has been lodged by Jamie Radtke, a Virginia Tea Party organizer, in protest of the General Assembly’s approval last month of a transportation plan that could raise annual taxes by $1.25 billion a year. McDonnell backed the legislation and hailed its passage as "an historic day in Virginia." The bill is sitting on McDonnell’s desk and Radtke is trying to pressure the governor not to sign it. She has started a Facebook page and a petition called "Stop Largest Tax Increase in Virginia History." She also narrated a TV ad claiming that McDonnell, who many believe has national ambition, "pushed the largest tax increase in Virginia history." The commercial was sponsored by the conservative Patriot Super PAC and aired in Iowa, site of the first presidential caucuses every four years. All of this leads to an obvious question: Does the transportation bill call for the largest tax increase in Virginia history? We checked. The package would generate $880 million a year in new state revenues in 2018 when it is fully phased in, according to a report by the House Appropriations Committee. About $680 million of that sum would come from tax increases. The legislation would replace the current 17.5-cent per-gallon gas tax with a 3.5 percent tax on gasoline and 6 percent diesel tax at the wholesale level. It would raise the 5 percent sales tax to 5.3 percent and increase the 3 percent motor vehicle tax sales tax to 4.3 percent. It also counts on Congress passing legislation that would give states authority to compel online retailers to collect sales tax. In addition, Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads would be empowered to impose a 0.7 percent local sales tax and other regional levies that could raise a total of $568 million a year for transportation by 2018. When you combine the new tax revenues for the state with the potential new levies flowing into Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads, the tax package comes to about $1.25 billion a year We asked Radtke to back up her claim that it all adds up to Virginia’s largest tax increase. "I’m slammed and don’t have time to pull all that for you right now," she replied in a March 5 email. Radtke added that former Gov. Mark Warner "had the biggest tax increase in 2004, which was $1.4 billion over two years. This one is $1 billion every year. I will see if I can get you more data later." Radtke never got back to us. It’s true that Warner’s 2004 tax increase, often described as record-breaking when it passed, originally generated about $700 million a year. So in terms of raw dollars, Radtke has a point: This year’s take hike, with a potential of producing $1.25 billion annually for state and local coffers, would set a high-water mark. But Radtke may not have chosen the most meaningful way to compare financial data from different points in time. Several analysts urged us to account for inflation. We followed their advice and found that Warner’s tax hike, in today’s dollars, comes to about $860 million a year. That still falls below the $1.25 billion potential of the bill that awaits McDonnell’s signature. Warner, however, is not the only governor in Virginia history who pushed through a tax increase that can be compared to the current plan. In 1986, Gerald Baliles signed a package of tax hikes that raised $422 million for transportation. Adjusted for inflation, it comes out to $893 million in 2013 dollars. That doesn’t beat this year’s bill, either. But we got a different result when we went back to 1966 and examined landmark legislation signed by Gov. Mills Godwin that created the state’s sales tax. The legislation phased in a 3 percent state sales tax over about three years to aid public education, help create Virginia’s community college system and pay for some transportation and administrative expenses. In addition, the law allowed counties and cities to enact a 1 percent sales tax, and all localities did that, according to a 1970 publication by the University of Virginia. The new levies brought in $282 million during the fiscal year that ended June 30, 1970, according to a report that year by the Department of Taxation. Adjusted for inflation, that comes to $1.68 billion today and easily outpaces the tax increase that McDonnell has endorsed. Our ruling Radtke said that the transportation package approved by the General Assembly this year amounts to the largest tax increase in Virginia history. Using raw dollars, she’s correct. But that’s not the whole story. The value of a dollar changes over time. When inflation is factored, the value of legislation approved in 1966 that created the state’s sales tax would be $1.67 billion annually today. That exceeds the $1.25 billion-a-year potential of this year’s bill. Radtke’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important information. That makes it Half True.

pomt-12081	"Our conservative Georgia values are under attack" ... (People) are "calling for the removal of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson statues."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2017/aug/30/brian-kemp/calls-take-down-washington-and-jefferson-statues/	With the debate over Confederate statues roiling the country, Georgia Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp suggested a similar controversy is brewing over the founding fathers. "You've seen it in the news — the radical left in our country, stinging from their 2016 election losses, has become increasingly desperate and unhinged," he wrote in an Aug. 23 fundraising email. "They want nothing more than to push their snowflake agenda on the entire nation, and our conservative Georgia values are under attack like never before. Now they're even calling for the removal of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson statues in the name of political correctness! Friend, I know you agree we can't allow the radical left to win in Georgia and force their liberal agenda down our throats." For us fact-checkers, the key question is whether there is a cry to get rid of statues of Washington and Jefferson. We found that a few people have said that, but whether there’s much of a drive is less certain. Between emailing the Kemp campaign and our own searches, we came up with some key instances. The clearest example came from Angela Rye, a CNN commentator and former Congressional Black Caucus director. "George Washington was a slave owner," Rye said on CNN on Aug. 17. "We need to call slave owners out for what they are. Whether we think they were protecting American freedom or not. He wasn’t protecting my freedom. I wasn’t someone — my ancestors weren’t deemed human beings to him. To me, I don’t care if it’s a George Washington statue or a Thomas Jefferson statue or a Robert E. Lee statue, they all need to come down." An equally clear call for taking down a statue of Washington came from James Dukes, pastor of Liberation Christian Center in Chicago. After President Donald Trump asked rhetorically if statues of Washington and Jefferson were next on the list for removal after Confederate leaders, Dukes took up the idea. He asked Mayor Rahm Emanuel to take down an equestrian statue of George Washington in the city’s South Side and rename the park where it stands. "It represents on one hand, a hero to some, a forefather, a revolutionary," Dukes said Aug. 16. "But then for us of African-American descent, it represents a person who owned 317 slaves." The prominent civil rights activist Al Sharpton also entered the fray, but the circumstances left it unclear whether this is something he might pursue further. Sharpton appeared on PBS’ Charlie Rose to talk about the violence in Charlottesville, Va. Rose asked Sharpton if the Jefferson Memorial should be taken down. "My great-grandfather was a slave owned by the family that Strom Thurmond was one of them," Sharpton said Aug. 14. "So this is personal. This is not some kind of removed discussion for us. Our families were victims of this. Certainly, it ought to be removed." But Sharpton then continued, saying he didn’t want his tax dollars going to maintain a building that honors a man with "that kind of background." He said there are private museums for that. That left open the option to keep the memorial in place and fund it privately. As far as we can tell, Sharpton has not brought up the issue again. Ambiguous examples There are instances where people expressed dismay at the slave-owning pasts of Washington and Jefferson, but they didn’t call for removing statues. We mention them because some have put them in the same bucket as the previous examples. Wilbert Cooper, a senior editor at the news service Vice, wrote Aug. 17 that if there were ever a serious push to to blow up Mount Rushmore, "I suspect I'd be onboard." "As long as we allow those men to be cults of personality who exist beyond reproach, we're never going to be able to see them for all of their good and all of their evil," Cooper wrote. A number of University of Virginia student organizations issued a list of demands to keep the history of slavery front and center on campus. The list included that "the statue of Jefferson serves as an emblem of white supremacy and should be re-contextualized with a plaque to include that history." At some point over the weekend of Aug. 19, the Jefferson statue on the University of Virginia campus was splashed with red paint. Measuring a movement We have two clear cases of African-Americans saying statues of Washington should come down, and one case involving the Jefferson Memorial. For context, we compared this to the interest in removing Confederate statues. As an approximate measure, we turned to the Nexis database of articles in major newspapers. Between Aug. 11 and Aug. 22 (the day before Kemp’s email), there were 2,113 articles that mentioned removing Confederate statues, but made no mention of George Washington or Thomas Jefferson. In the same period, 183 articles mentioned removing Washington or Jefferson statues. This included Trump’s own reference to people seeking to take down those statues. Roughly speaking, the removal of Confederate statues is at least 11 times more commonly mentioned than taking down statues of Washington or Jefferson. Our ruling Kemp said there are calls for the removal of statues of Washington and Jefferson. We found two instances where two people unambiguously called for those statues to come down, plus another instance where an interviewer’s question elicited a mixed reply that included the words "certainly it ought to be removed." Beyond those examples, there is scant evidence of a broader movement to take down statues of Washington and Jefferson, especially not along the lines of the push against Confederate monuments. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate this claim Half True.

"He came back from Afghanistan and came home to a job as an electrician," the ad says. "But every year, his paycheck doesn’t go as far. He just wants some economic security. Richard Burr voted to protect tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas but voted against a tax break to help working people like Zach. Folks, that’s just wrong. Those aren’t our values." We wanted to find out whether Ross was right that "Richard Burr voted to protect tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas but voted against a tax break to help working people." It’s a frequent refrain of Ross’ campaign, and outside this ad she has repeated the claim in June, in September and at other times on the campaign trail. It’s also a line of attack other Democratic politicians across the country have used before – ranging from Barack Obama, in his 2014 State of the Union address, to a failed Senate candidate in Kentucky. But there’s a major caveat: Variations on this claim have received rulings like Mostly False or Half True on our Truth-O-Meter, depending on the way it was phrased. Given that the Ross-Burr race is one of the closest in the country, and North Carolina has been particularly hard-hit by the outsourcing of factory jobs, we decided to take a look at how much truth there was to Ross’ claim. Ross' ad is talking about a bill called the "Bring Jobs Home Act," which Senate Democrats tried to pass in 2012 and 2014. It failed both years due to opposition from Republicans, and both years Burr did vote against it. Burr also joined his fellow Republicans in voting against a 2010 bill that had similar provisions, called the "Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act." The goal of the bills There is no tax break for companies that move overseas, so the claim is slightly misleading on that account. There are tax breaks, however, for any U.S. company that relocates – whether it’s to the other side of town or the other side of the world. The bills that Burr voted against would have created a new tax incentive for companies that moved jobs back to the United States from overseas. They also would have exempted overseas moves from the types of relocation that can receive tax breaks. So the claim itself has the facts of the bill basically right, although it leaves room for people to get the wrong impression. The money angle Tax experts have repeatedly told PolitiFact that the bills were almost entirely symbolic. That’s because the punishments or rewards companies might have received would’ve been insignificant – not nearly large enough to change their behavior and either bring jobs back or stop jobs from leaving. An analysis by Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation showed the U.S. government would have lost $214 million between 2015 and 2024 if the 2014 version of the bill had passed. But for the sake of not trying to look into the future, let’s just take a look at the 2015 estimates. Companies that outsourced in 2015 would have lost $9 million that year if the bill had passed, the committee found. Meanwhile, companies that insourced would’ve received $19 million in tax breaks. Those numbers are minuscule. Corporations were expected to pay $341.7 billion in income taxes in 2015, according to the Tax Policy Center, a branch of the left-of-center Urban Institute and Brookings Institution. The $9 million in extra payments represents 0.0026 percent of the total corporate income taxes. That’s a quarter of a hundredth of 1 percent. The $19 million in savings isn’t much more significant, representing 0.0056 percent of the total. Wouldn't have changed corporate strategies Tax experts have previously opined, looking at similar numbers, that the bill simply would not have done enough to persuade any major company to change its business plan. "It adds up to a trivial amount of money," James Hines, a professor of law and economics at the University of Michigan, told PolitiFact for a 2014 fact check. "Given how many big multinational firms we have, it’s impossible that it has any effect on their behavior." Howard Gleckman, a researcher at the Tax Policy Center, agreed. "For many multinationals, the credit would be largely meaningless," he wrote. "Those firms already pay close to a zero U.S. tax rate thanks to their ability to shift income to low-tax countries. With their U.S. tax liability already low, the credit would do almost nothing to encourage them to shift operations to the U.S." Our ruling Ross said that Burr "voted to protect tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas but voted against a tax break to help working people." PolitiFact has docked points on several versions of this same claim in the past, in large part because it oversimplifies the bills in question and doesn’t account for the fact that experts don’t think the bills would have done anything to keep jobs in the United States, or bring them back, had the changes become law. Burr did vote against the bills in question – inconsequential though they might have been – so there is a sliver of truth here. But the reality of the situation isn’t nearly so cut-and-dried as Ross describes it.

pomt-02076	In 2007, Ed Gillespie "was paid $300,000 to be the frontman for a coalition that made the individual mandate the centerpiece of its health reform plan."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2014/may/23/democratic-party-virginia/virginia-democrats-say-gillespie-was-paid-300000-l/	When money was offered, Democrats say Republican U.S. Senate candidate Ed Gillespie was pleased to support an individual mandate that all Americans have health insurance. "In 2007, he (Gillespie) was paid $300,000 to be the frontman for a coalition that made the individual mandate the centerpiece of its health reform plan," the Democratic Party of Virginia said earlier this spring in a news release. "However, just last week, Gillespie’s campaign reversed course and claimed that he ‘consistently opposed the mandates.’" Gillespie, a former lobbyist, is the overwhelming favorite to win the Virginia GOP’s nomination for the U.S. Senate at a state convention next month and oppose Democrat incumbent Mark Warner this fall. Despite some unclear statements and writings in the past, Gillespie repeatedly has said this year that he’s always been opposed to an individual mandate -- the central provision of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. So we decided to examine the Democrats’ claim that Gillespie was paid $300,000 to seek just such a law. Ashley Bauman, spokeswoman for state Democrats, pointed us to news releases, op-eds and media coverage detailing Gillespie’s involvement with the Coalition to Advance Health Care Reform -- a group of large businesses that formed in early 2007 to find ways of curbing health costs and get more people insured. The coalition’s website listed guiding principles to overhaul the nation’s health care laws. It called for a "market-based health care system" that provided financial incentives for people to adopt healthy behaviors and assistance so low-income people would get routine care outside of emergency rooms. But the tenet Democrats’ zero in on is the group’s call for "universal coverage with individual responsibility." "Public policy has long mandated that care be provided when needed. We believe this policy should be balanced with a requirement that individuals carry health insurance regardless of their employment status," the group wrote. "All Americans should have access to affordable quality healthcare services, with no exclusions for pre-existing conditions. The market should drive these policies with the government, businesses and individuals sharing responsibility to ensure affordable health coverage is achieved." Leading the coalition was Steve Burd, then CEO of the Safeway grocery chain. He announced the formation in a May 6, 2007 op-ed in The Washington Times, writing "every American should be required to carry health insurance." The next day, the group announced it had brought in "nationally-recognized professionals," to "manage the organization." The two mentioned by name were Gillespie and his lobbying partner, Jack Quinn, a Democrat who had been chief of staff in the mid 1990s to then Vice President Al Gore. Reports filed in the U.S. Senate show Gillespie registered as a lobbyist for the coalition during the first half of 2007. Bauman pointed us to data on the Center for Responsive Politics’ website showing that the coalition in 2007 paid $300,000 to Quinn Gillespie & Associates, a firm that was founded in 2000. Gillespie’s activities Gillespie’s ties to the coalition trace back several months before the its formation was announced. Federal lobbying records show that Quinn Gillespie & Associates registered to represent the coalition on March 1, 2007. The firm listed 16 employees, including Gillespie, as lobbyists for the health care group. Paul Logan, spokesman for Gillespie’s campaign, said his boss never advocated for the mandate and was listed as lobbyist out of an abundance of caution. "It was the practice at QGA to register even if you were not lobbying lawmakers on behalf of a client," he emailed. "There is a penalty for not registering to lobby and doing lobbying work, but no penalty for registering and not lobbying." Logan gave us a letter Burd wrote to the Gillespie on March 24, 2014 to rebut attacks that the Republican lobbied for the requirement. "Your counsel with CAHR was very clear. To establish a set of core principles at a high level to attract a broad coalition and to stay away from any support for an individual mandate," Burd wrote. "As I recall, you were personally opposed to the idea of an individual mandate and encouraged the coalition to stay with market-based principles to guide its work. At no time did you advocate or lobby for an individual mandate on behalf of CAHR." Burd added, "in fact you never attended any meetings the coalition had with elected leaders and you left Quinn Gillespie and Associates within a month of the coalition being formed, well before CAHR began to actively engage in the policy debate." Gillespie did leave his lobbying firm -- about six weeks after his affiliation with coalition was announced -- to start work as an adviser to President George W. Bush on June 26, 2007. Before leaving, Gillespie promoted the coalition’s broad health care agenda during a May 8 radio interview on WBUR in Boston. He was never specifically asked about an individual mandate. But he did say, "it’s important to emphasize what this coalition is advocating, which is getting people in through individual responsibility and not a mandate -- a government-imposed dictate -- on small businesses." The payments Logan said Gillespie did not receive the $300,000 from the coalition but would not provide other compensation figures. Lobbying records show the coalition paid that amount to Gillespie’s firm -- not Gillespie personally -- in 2007. Burd, in an interview, told us he recalls meeting once with Gillespie while forming the coalition, on March 15, 2007. During that session, Burd said Gillespie gave advice on how to organize and rally support for the group. "There’s not a chance in the world that we would have paid him $300,000 for one meeting," he said. Biannual lobbying records show the coalition paid the Quinn Gillespie $120,000 during the first half of 2007, when Gillespie was still with the firm. Most of the money the coalition paid to the firm in 2007 -- about $180,000 -- was remitted in the second half of the year. A year-end lobbying report covering that span did not list Gillespie as a lobbyist. Logan said Gillespie severed all ties with his firm when he became a presidential adviser. So about 60 percent of the coalition’s $300,000 payment was made during the six months after Gillespie left the firm. With this information, we contacted Bauman again and asked for proof of the Democrat’s claim that Gillespie received all of the money. "We have frequently referred to Gillespie’s firm making more than $300,000, through its work on behalf of CAHR, " she emailed. "In this instance, we should have been clearer, but we stand by the fact that the firm he founded, QGA (Quinn Gillespie & Associates), was paid $300,000 to lobby on behalf of a group that supported the individual mandate." We should note that Democrats have said at least two other times this year that Gillespie -- not his company -- was paid $300,000 by the coalition. Prior to leaving the firm, Gillespie received a $4.8 million payout based on a 2004 sale of his lobbying company, according to a disclosure form he filed upon entering the White House detailing his finances during the previous 18 months. Logan said that amount was "scheduled and paid long before Ed agreed to go to the White House." "Ed severed all ties to QGA when he went to work at the White House and did not receive any compensation or distributive share from them after he left," Logan said. Our ruling The state Democratic Party said Gillespie was paid $300,000 "to be the frontman for a coalition that made the individual mandate the centerpiece of its health reform plan." This, Democrats said, belies Gillespie’s assertion that he’s always opposed mandatory health coverage. There’s no doubt Gillespie was a key adviser to the coalition, as was his business partner. His role was prominently noted in a news release announcing formation of the group, and he spoke on behalf of the group in a radio interview. The group supported an individual mandate, although there’s a bit of hyperbole in the Democrats’ contention it was the ‘centerpiece’ of their agenda. The top item listed on the coalition’s "core principles" was bringing market-based efficiency and price transparency to health care. The founder of the coalition says Gillespie privately voiced opposition to a mandate, urged the pursuit of other reforms and never attended the coalition's meetings with politicians. Records show Gillespie’s lobbying firm -- not Gillespie, himself -- was paid $300,000 by the health care coalition in 2007. Gillespie left the firm that June. During the first half of 2007, Gillespie was among 16 people at his firm registered as lobbyists for the coalition. The bulk of the payments came in the second half of 2007, after Gillespie departed. When we pointed this out to the Democratic Party, a spokeswoman backed away from its improbable claim the Gillespie received all the fees paid to his firm. Gillespie’s campaign denies he was paid $300,000, but would not say how much he did pocket. So bits of truth in the Democrats’ statement are tarnished with exaggeration and create an unsupportable story that Gillespie, when the money was right, led a lobbying effort for an individual mandate. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Democratic Party of Virginia	None	None	None	2014-05-23T06:00:00	2014-03-26	['Ed_Gillespie']
pomt-09097	Bill McCollum "served as a lobbyist whose clients enabled mortgages for illegal immigrants."	false	/florida/statements/2010/jun/23/rick-scott/scott-says-mccollum-lobbied-clients-who-paved-way-/	Republican rivals for governor, Attorney General Bill McCollum and Rick Scott, have accused each other of being too helpful toward illegal immigrants -- a hot topic in the wake of the Arizona immigration law. Their campaigns sent dueling press releases June 15 and 16, 2010, trying to portray their opponent's business practices as being too friendly to illegal immigrants. The Republicans' positions on illegal immigration will be key for primary voters. If elected, Scott has promised to bring an Arizona-style law to Florida -- a law that requires police officers who have made lawful stops to check an individual's immigration status. PolitiFact gave McCollum a full-flop for sending mixed signals on the law -- first opposing the original version, then stating he supported it after Arizona amended it to prohibit racial profiling, but then stating Florida doesn't need such a law. They are now arguing about whose past business practices benefitted illegal immigrants. McCollum sent these fighting words in a press release June 15, 2010: “In just the latest case of hypocrisy, it was revealed today that Rick Scott has heavily invested in a company that is geared to helping illegal aliens transfer money to family and friends out of the country. ... Rick Scott says he wants to crack down on illegal immigration, but now we find out he has been profiting from illegal immigrants." We rated that statement True. The following day, June 16, 2010, Scott's campaign issued a press release about McCollum which stated: "Bill McCollum jumped his sinking ship of a campaign today and fled to Washington, D.C., where he served as a lobbyist whose clients enabled mortgages for illegal immigrants.'' ("Fled to Washington, D.C." refers to a day of meetings McCollum had June 16 with a tax reform group and national conservative leaders, said his spokeswoman Kristy Campbell.) In this Truth-O-Meter item, we explore whether McCollum "served as a lobbyist whose clients enabled mortgages for illegal immigrants." The Scott campaign's press release focuses on three groups that it says McCollum lobbied for: the financial company Citigroup, a non-profit called AmeriDream Charity, and the Mortgage Bankers Association, the organization that represents the industry. Scott's campaign sent us McCollum's lobbyist registrations showing he registered to lobby federal offices for AmeriDream in 2002 and 2003, CitiGroup in 2002 and Mortgage Bankers Association of America in 2001. McCollum lobbied after he left Congress in 2001. Even though no federal laws prohibit making mortgages to illegal immigrants, we doubt any financial firm or organization, in today’s political climate, will acknowledge they offer or have offered loans to illegal immigrants. But many newspaper reports across the country in the past decade have described illegal immigrants who hold home mortgages. Some likely obtained mortgages from institutions that didn’t ask about immigration status, or winked. And certainly, lenders are occasionally duped by mortgage fraud committed by U.S. citizens and immigrants alike. The question here, though, is whether McCollum’s clients enabled those loans while he lobbied for them? We took "enable" to mean that the companies allowed illegal immigrants to obtain mortgages. We started with the sources Scott's campaign cited in its press release but first did some background on Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers, or ITINs, which have been used by legal and illegal immigrants as a form of ID. The IRS started issuing ITINs in 1996 to provide a method to process tax returns and payments for those not eligible for Social Security numbers, including non-resident aliens. The IRS says ITINs are not intended for other uses. But by 2002, several major banking chains in the U.S. -- including Citibank – were accepting ITINs to allow customers to open bank accounts because they wanted to tap into the growing Hispanic immigrant market. That paved the way for some banks to offer mortgages through ITINs. Mark Rodgers, a Citigroup vice president who wrote an article in the online newsletter of the Comptroller of the Currency in the fall of 2004, touted the firm’s efforts in 2003 to offer bank accounts and money transfers, or remittances to Hispanics. We asked him whether his company provided mortgages to illegal immigrants in 2002. He explained in an e-mail that Citigroup accepted ITINs from mortgage applicants, and approved loans for "applicants with proper identification, who meet our loan requirements and who have filed appropriate tax documents with the U.S. tax authorities, which we have verified.” He emphasized every applicant had to meet the requirements, but did not respond to a follow-up question on when Citigroup began the ITIN program. However, newspaper articles in The Palm Beach Post and Houston Chronicle in 2005 showed illegal immigrants held Citibank mortgages at least by 2004. McCollum lobbied for Citigroup only in 2002. According to a March 18, 2002, article in Business Wire, Citibank also said it would begin accepting Mexican Consular IDs as identification for Mexican immigrants living in the U.S. to open bank accounts. The card, known as a Matricula Consular, identifies the holder as a Mexican national. But that article does not specifically mention mortgages. Next we looked at Scott's claim about AmeriDream. AmeriDream distributed a press release Feb. 7, 2005, announcing it would accept ITINs to help immigrants buy homes, citing “an increasing number of private lenders throughout the country that have begun ITIN loan and mortgage insurance programs.” But by 2005, McCollum was no longer lobbying for AmeriDream. Federal lobbyist registration records show he lobbied for the company in 2002 and 2003. The Scott campaign also cited a Sept. 18, 2007, Boston Globe article about illegal immigrants buying homes, which quoted a representative from the Mortgage Bankers Association. "It's not our bank members' job to determine immigration policy," said Corey Carlisle, senior director of government affairs at the Mortgage Bankers Association, a national organization representing more than 3,000 companies. "But ... they don't want to make a loan to somebody that's not going to be able to repay it." McCollum was registered to lobby this organization in 2001. So we asked an association spokesman what its policy was in 2001 regarding illegal immigrants obtaining mortgages. John Mechem replied in an e-mail that MBA complies with all applicable state and federal laws. He added that McCollum lobbied on efforts related to the Federal Housing Administration’s multifamily (rental housing) programs, not on mortgages for immigrants. Scott spokeswoman Jennifer Baker, however, insists that since the MBA represents lenders who give mortgages to illegal aliens, McCollum in effect "enabled" the mortgages through his MBA lobbying. We asked the McCollum campaign for a response to Scott's claim. Campbell, McCollum’s spokeswoman, said in an e-mail "Bill McCollum never advocated to give mortgages to illegal immigrants." She said he lobbied on tax issues -- not housing issues -- for CitiGroup, and MBA told us that he lobbied on issues related to a rental housing program. But the Scott campaign didn't claim that McCollum lobbied to give mortgages to illegal immigrants -- only that his clients "enabled" those mortgages. So where does that leave us? To recap, McCollum lobbied for the Mortgage Bankers Association in 2001, but that is a trade association that represents lenders and doesn't issue mortgages directly. Representing bankers doesn't "enable" mortgages. McCollum lobbied for Citigroup in 2002. That company started accepting the Mexican consular ID in 2002, but news articles didn't start mentioning Citi providing mortgages to customers with the ITIN identification until 2004. He lobbied for AmeriDream in 2002 and 2003, and AmeriDream didn't announce it would start accepting ITINs until 2005. There are numerous reports in the past decade that illegal immigrants have been able to obtain mortgages through the consular cards or ITINs, but there are no specific examples we could find or Scott could provide that McCollum's three clients did so when he was their lobbyist. We rate this claim False.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2010-06-23T11:46:59	2010-06-16	['None']
