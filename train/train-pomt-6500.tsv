pomt-04767	Says the top 20 percent of income earners pay nearly 70 percent of all federal taxes.	true	/texas/statements/2012/aug/27/lamar-smith/lamar-smith-says-top-20-percent-income-earners-pay/	Speaking in Austin recently, U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith said he believes Congress will reach a compromise to extend the so-called "Bush tax cuts" before they expire at the end of this year. We were already working on a related fact-check of the San Antonio Republican: In an Aug. 1, 2012, press release, Smith touted his vote for the extension that day and said, "The top 20 percent of income earners (over $74,000) pay nearly 70 percent of all federal taxes." Smith, whose district takes in part of Travis County, gave similar figures in his Aug. 23, 2012, speech to the Austin-Oak Hill Rotary Club. We’ll describe those but stick to checking his earlier 20-percent claim. The Bush tax cuts are a mix of changes to tax rates, exemptions, deductions and credits enacted in 2001 and 2003 under President George W. Bush and extended in 2010. Smith’s press release credits its numbers to a July 22, 2012, Wall Street Journal chart, which in turn cites a July 10, 2012, study of 2008-09 data by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The Journal’s bar chart shows the top 20 percent of U.S. wage-earners made $74,000 or more and paid nearly 70 percent of federal taxes. Though there wasn’t a precise percentage on the bar chart, there was in the CBO’s report on its study: 67.9 percent. Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, told us by email that allowing for rounding, Smith’s full statement was correct except for some clarification needed on the $74,000 salary figure (which was also on the Journal’s chart). That’s how much a single person living alone would have had to earn to rank in the top 20 percent in 2009, Williams said, but the CBO adjusts its figures for household size. "A two-person household had to make $104,700 and a four-person household had to make $148,100 to hit the top quintile," Williams said. Whether to extend the Bush tax cuts for all taxpayers or for everyone except "rich" taxpayers is a major part of the battle in Congress, where Democratic plans have proposed extending the cuts for households with income below a cutoff point (which has ranged from $200,000 for individuals to $1 million). The Republican-majority House approved a plan extending the cuts for all taxpayers in the August vote Smith cited in his press release. During the debate, politicians have made a range of claims about how much of the nation’s revenue comes from the wealthiest households. Smith’s 20-percent statistic avoids a pitfall PolitiFact has found in some of those statements. In 2010 and 2011, Republicans fell foul of the Truth-O-Meter by claiming the top 1 percent of wage earners paid more than 40 percent of "the entire revenue" and "all taxes." That group paid more than 40 percent of all income taxes, but income taxes are only about half of the total federal revenue pie. Smith also cites "all federal taxes" -- the whole pie, including payroll, corporate income and excise taxes -- but includes a lot more taxpayers. According to supplemental data for the July CBO report, there were 23.6 million households in the top 20 percent of wage-earners and 1.1 million households in the top 1 percent. The top 1 percent, the report says, earned $282,900 or more per single-person household and paid 22.3 percent of all federal taxes. That’s closer to the stats Smith gave in his Austin speech, which included measures for the top 1 percent but referred only to share of federal income tax revenue. He told us he usually gives rounded versions of the percentages, and produced his reference material -- a chart he keeps in his wallet, based partly on Oct. 24, 2011, data from the business-backed Tax Foundation -- showing the top 1 percent earned 16.9 percent of 2009 income in the U.S. but paid 36.7 percent of federal income taxes. Our ruling Smith said the top 20 percent of taxpayers shoulder nearly 70 percent of all federal taxes. According to the CBO’s latest math, it’s 67.9 percent. We rate his statement True.

pomt-13259	"New York State has been horribly, horribly hurt by NAFTA"	mostly false	/new-york/statements/2016/oct/16/donald-trump/no-huge-impact-new-york-nafta/	New York State has less than half of the manufacturing jobs it did in 1990, state data shows. But experts disagree about why. Speaking to Fred Dicker on Talk 1300 in September, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump blamed the decline on free trade. He specifically cited the North American Free Trade Agreement, a three-country accord negotiated by Canada, Mexico and the United States. He took a shot at his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton by placing the blame on her husband. "Right now our jobs are being taken away from us like babies. They’re going to Mexico and other countries. We just can’t let it happen," Trump said. "New York State has been horribly, horribly hurt by NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton." New York State’s unemployment rate is almost half of what it was six years ago, and the state has more private sector jobs than ever. But the largest private sector employers in the state are retailers like Walmart and colleges like Columbia University according to the state Department of Labor. But is Trump right that the trade agreement "horribly, horribly hurt" the state? A decline in manufacturing Manufacturing jobs were already on the decline in New York State before NAFTA’s implementation in 1994. In 1990, New York State had slightly more than 1 million manufacturing jobs, according to the Department of Labor. By 1994, about 193,000 of those jobs were gone. The decline continued until 1996, when manufacturing jobs held steady for two years. Between 1998 and 2010, New York lost another 340,000 manufacturing jobs. That loss happened at the same, or slower, rate than the years immediately preceding NAFTA. Since then, the job losses have leveled off. The state has lost more than 6,000 manufacturing jobs since the beginning of 2010, but the rate of decline is much slower than it has been in the past two decades. Why the decline? Experts offer diverse answers on why New York State lost more than 360,000 manufacturing jobs since 1994. But none we talked to considers NAFTA the main cause. In 2011, the Economic Policy Institute released a report that found 34,300 of the state's jobs were displaced because of NAFTA. Teresa Fort, an expert in international trade from Dartmouth College, called automation the mostly likely cause. U.S. trade with other nations has affected some industries, she said. "International trade is unlikely to be the main cause of the aggregate decline in U.S. manufacturing employment," Fort said. "But it has negatively affected workers in certain industries and areas that were displaced by foreign production." The Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan research arm of the federal government, also said in a report last year that NAFTA did not have a significant impact on the United States economy because trade with Canada and Mexico only accounts for a small part of gross domestic product. The same report points to the benefits of the trade agreement. Exports to Canada have more than doubled since 1993, while exports to Mexico have more than quadrupled. The U.S. auto industry has seen a significant increase in exports to Mexico under the deal, for example. The China factor Trump is right when he says increased trade most likely caused manufacturing jobs to leave New York State. Peter Schott of Yale University and Justin Pierce of the Federal Reserve wrote a report last year pinning a big part of the manufacturing decline on easier trade with China. As PolitiFact previously reported, lower tariffs set by the U.S. government for China have made trade with that country easier since the 1980s. Researchers say that’s led to the rapid decline in U.S. manufacturing. "The research evidence suggests that the impacts of NAFTA on manufacturing jobs was limited and were dwarfed by the impacts of imports from China," said Susan Houseman, a senior economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research. "In addition, manufacturing in the north has been harmed by the continued migration of manufacturing jobs to the south, where unionization rates are lower." Experts also point to the different economies of countries where we trade. Robert Lawrence of the Peterson Institute for International Economics wrote earlier this year that lower wages in countries like Mexico provide an incentive for businesses to manufacture there. Wage decline In a separate analysis, John McLaren of the University of Virginia and Shushanik Hakobyan of Fordham University found wages declined in New York State during the implementation of NAFTA. They compared wages by locality from 1990 to 2000. By the end of the decade, wages had declined in New York State as a result of NAFTA, but only by a small amount. "For me the punchline is that these are all really small numbers," McLaren said. "So what we’re talking about is a change in wage growth over a decade at most around a percentage point for most workers." Some workers were more affected than others, but on average the change was small. Our ruling During a radio interview, Trump said "New York State has been horribly, horribly hurt by NAFTA." Manufacturing jobs have declined in New York State and the United States since before NAFTA was established in 1994. Experts blame the decline on several factors, like increased trade with China, automation and economic incentives for businesses to move manufacturing to other countries. Trade has played a significant role in the decline of manufacturing in New York State, but NAFTA isn’t the main cause, experts say. We rate this claim as Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/12740d0c-d3a2-43c0-bd46-7a5504d85863	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-10-16T21:34:21	2016-09-15	['North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement']
pomt-01918	"I had the lowest net worth of any American president in the 20th century when I took office."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/29/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-i-had-lowest-net-worth-any-american-p/	Former President Bill Clinton defended his wife and potential presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for saying they left the White House "not only dead broke, but in debt." He doubled down on it, in a way, while insisting just because they found success does not mean they are out of touch. "I think I had the lowest net worth of any American president in the 20th century when I took office," he told host David Gregory in an interview airing June 29, 2014, on NBC’s Meet the Press. "But I still could have been tone deaf. And, you know, now I don't, and we've got a good life, and I'm grateful for it." Intrigued by his comment, we wanted to know if it was accurate. Nowadays, the Clintons are not known for living on modest means. A Washington Post report says Bill Clinton earned more than $100 million from speeches given in the U.S. and abroad between January 2001, when he left office, and January 2013, when Hillary Clinton left her role as Secretary of State. She reportedly draws $200,000 for each public appearance, a new talking point among pundits who oppose her potential 2016 presidential candidacy. Clinton is considered the wealthiest living president and among the top-10 all-time wealthiest, with the Clintons’ combined net worth at about $55 million, according to the website 24/7 Wall Street, which started evaluating the net worth of presidents in 2010. But to Clinton’s point, it was not always this way. Clinton’s pre-presidential wealth The Clintons did not move into the White House with old money akin to the political dynasties of the Roosevelts, Kennedys and Bushes. And unlike nearly every other president, Clinton’s wife was the breadwinner ahead of his run for the Oval Office. Clinton sought a political career not long after graduating from Yale Law School in 1973 and marrying Hillary Rodham two years later, first winning a term as Arkansas’ attorney general in 1976 and following it up with five terms as governor. He earned $35,000 a year as governor, consistent with the lower pay of other Southern governors, as well as some speaking fees, honorariums and in-kind income, such as living in the governor’s residence. Hillary Clinton, then a lawyer and senior partner in the Rose Law Firm of Little Rock, earned $92,000 salary and listed her share of her law firm’s profit-sharing and retirement plan between $100,001 and $250,000, according to a New York Times examination of the couple’s finances in 1992. The Clintons listed their net worth as nearly $700,000 in a statement released a few months later, a substantial hike from the $418,692 net worth reported at the end of the 1989, according to the Washington Post. Assets included big gains in their investment portfolio (reaching $387,077) and retirement plans of $180,200, and liabilities included $65,000 mortgage for a half-interest in a condo co-owned with Hillary Clinton’s parents and a $100,000 bank loan from his last governor’s race. Was Clinton counting himself separately from his wife? We don’t know for sure, because our email wasn’t returned. But that would not be consistent with how married couples are usually treated under the tax code, an expert told us. "Most net worths of individuals, presidents or otherwise, are viewed as joint net worths," said Barbara Perry, senior fellow and associate professor in the University of Virginia Miller Center’s Presidential Oral History Program. "Most of these (presidents) did not have spouses with their own high income." Comparing against other presidents While we have a good picture of Clinton’s net worth, it is more difficult to gauge the net worths of many other presidents who served in the 20th century. The 24/7 Wall St. research is helpful but does not detail presidents’ net worth before taking office -- the crux of what we’re checking. We heard from several experts on presidents who said the data we need is just not available. Problems include a lack of uniform candidate financial disclosure requirements, inflation and changing national circumstances. "It’s one of those Clintonesque statements that can be true but who knows?" said Lewis Gould, a visiting distinguished professor at Monmouth College and scholar of William McKinley. We know some presidents are not really in the conversation. Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy all came from wealthy families, while Lyndon B. Johnson, Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush all either were successful in real estate or investments, or both. Others came from a career in public service and did not have significant family wealth, including Calvin Coolidge, Dwight Eisenhower and Woodrow Wilson. Often, people discussing the least monied presidents -- especially in the 20th century -- turn to Harry S. Truman. Truman’s money problems and bankruptcy-dodging as a result of his failed haberdashery business in the 1920s are no secret. With debts over his head, he continued to climb political ladders, first as a county judge and ultimately as U.S. senator, vice president and president upon Franklin D. Roosevelt’s death in 1945. Truman continued to live modestly as a senator and vice president, residing in a two-bedroom apartment in Washington, D.C., shared with his wife Bess, daughter Margaret and ailing mother-in-law. Truman’s mother-in-law, not Truman, owned the well-known Truman Home in Independence, Mo., said Alonzo Hamby, a Truman biographer and distinguished professor of history emeritus at Ohio University. Even as a U.S. senator in 1935 earning $10,000, Truman was not in a solid enough financial position to save the family farm owned by his mother, Hamby said. So even though it’s not clear what his net worth was before he became president, Hamby said, "I find it very hard to believe that Bill Clinton was in a tighter financial situation." Another contender, though his term straddles the 19th and 20th centuries, is William McKinley, who was assassinated six months into his second term on September 1901. Based in Canton, Ohio, McKinley practiced law before becoming Ohio governor. The economic collapse of 1893 dealt him a personal financial setback during his time as governor, as he had co-signed loans from a friend who ended up going bankrupt (his friends helped him raise the money). He took office in 1897 and left an estate of $250,000 when he died, Gould said. We also found a document through the Gerald R. Ford presidential library suggesting that the 38th president took office with a relatively small net worth. The document, with a date of Oct. 29, 1973 (which would have been a year before Ford became president), showed a net worth of $256,378. That would have the same buying power as about $810,000 in 1992, when adjusted for inflation. Russell Riley, co-chair of the Miller Center’s Presidential Oral History Program and director of the Clinton Presidential History Project, said Clinton’s claim did not strike him as much of an exaggeration, "if an exaggeration at all." "He may have taken it one step too far by asserting he was No. 1 on the list, but if he’s not No. 1 he’s somewhere near the top," Riley said. Our ruling Clinton said, "I had the lowest net worth of any American president in the 20th century when I took office." Without a doubt, Clinton’s net worth was one of the lowest of 20th century presidents, experts told us. Whether it was the lowest is hard to say, and we could not find information to support it. There’s a good case to be made that Truman entered the White House with a (albeit unknown) smaller net worth. There’s not enough evidence to prove Clinton correct, but he is at least right in his larger point: He did not enter the White House with the wealth of many of his contemporaries. On balance, we rate his claim Half True.	None	Bill Clinton	None	None	None	2014-06-29T19:52:05	2014-06-29	['United_States']
pomt-09699	The House health care bill pays for "about six years of program with a decade of revenue, with the heaviest costs concentrated in the second five years."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/06/wall-street-journal-editorial-page/house-health-care-bill-pays-itself-over-long-run/	Do you think the conservative editorial board of the Wall Street Journal likes the health care bill written by Democrats in the House of Representatives? Well, the headline on a recent editorial about it was "The Worst Bill Ever." The editorial disliked new regulations for the health care system and additional taxes to pay for health insurance expansions. The bill also "disguises hundreds of billions of dollars in additional costs with budget gimmicks," the editorial said. "It 'pays for' about six years of program with a decade of revenue, with the heaviest costs concentrated in the second five years. The House also pretends Medicare payments to doctors will be cut by 21.5% next year and deeper after that, 'saving' about $250 billion." We've looked into the problem of Medicare payments previously and whether that should be considered part of health care reform. We found evidence to support both sides. So we rated Sen. John Cornyn's statement about it -- "The first installment of health care reform ... will raise the deficit by $250 billion " -- as Half True. Here, we wanted to look at the claim that the bill pays for "about six years of program with a decade of revenue, with the heaviest costs concentrated in the second five years." To check on the bill's financial condition, we turned to the Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, the nonpartisan budget agency that creates calculations for how much bills in Congress will cost the government. Political leaders and others regularly turn to the CBO as the definitive source for budget projections. The CBO looked at the bill's new spending, new savings and new taxes. CBO analysts added those numbers together to get the bill's impact on the deficit for a given year, and over 10 years. Generally speaking, the CBO does not provide numbers after the first 10 years, because it believes those numbers are subject to too much uncertainty. Looking at the House health care bill, it takes awhile for all the pieces of it to take effect, with different measures going into effect in different years. The requirement for individuals to buy insurance, for example, doesn't begin until 2013. People are subject to a tax penalty for not having insurance, and they'll see that penalty on the return they file in 2014. The new taxes on high-income individuals, however, go into effect earlier, in 2011. The CBO projects that these tax revenues will rise gradually over the first nine years. Meanwhile, cost savings don't start kicking in until 2012. The cost savings grow slowly but then get bigger in the last three years of the plan. (You can follow along with these numbers by looking at Page 3 of this CBO report .) The Journal editorial is right that the CBO shows the biggest costs come in the second five years of the program, from 2015 to 2019. But the cost savings are the biggest in the final years as well. Overall, the plan is in the black through 2014, dips briefly into the red in 2015 and 2016, and then pays for itself again in 2017, 2018 and 2019. Over 10 years, the bill reduces the deficit by $104 billion. The CBO did not create numerical projections for the years 2020 to 2029, but the report notes that for those years, the bill would probably result in "slight reductions in federal budget deficits. Those estimates are all subject to substantial uncertainty." To be clear, those who oppose the Democratic bill think the CBO's estimates will likely be undermined by future events. "The tax hikes will bring in less revenues than is estimated, and the spending provisions will likely be expanded over time," said Brian Riedl of the conservative Heritage Institution. "Even if the CBO assumes it's revenue neutral, the smart money would bet on lower tax revenues, fewer spending cuts and higher program costs." (Riedl added that he wasn't questioning the work of the CBO, he just thought it would be overtaken by political realities.) On the other hand, Edwin Park of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said that it's significant that the CBO found the bill lowered the deficit over the first 10 years and also in the subsequent 10 years after that. That shows that the bill pays for itself over the long term and is fiscally sound. "The CBO has been crystal clear that it reduces the deficit in the out years," he said. The Journal editorial says the House bill "'pays for' about six years of program with a decade of revenue, with the heaviest costs concentrated in the second five years." It's true that the taxes kick in first, before many of the bill's biggest expenses get started. But the editorial doesn't mention that the CBO projects the largest cost savings for the bill's final four years, and that the bill appears to be self-sustaining starting around 2017. So we rate the statement Half True.	None	Wall Street Journal editorial page	None	None	None	2009-11-06T16:58:52	2009-11-02	['None']
pomt-03201	Says U.N. arms treaty will mandate a "new international gun registry."	false	/texas/statements/2013/aug/28/steve-stockman/un-treaty-about-weapons-systems-moving-between-cou/	CLARIFICATION, 4:06 p.m., Aug. 28, 2013: We amended this story to clarify that an explanation naming Sudan and Chad is hypothetical. "Ever since its founding 65 years ago, the U.N. has been hell-bent on bringing the U.S. to its knees," U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman, R-Friendswood, said in a recent fundraising letter. The letter, forwarded to PolitiFact by a reader Aug. 19, 2013, sought donations to the National Association for Gun Rights to battle "the U.N.’s ‘Small Arms Treaty’ " and said that the treaty’s provisions include "mandating a new international gun registry." Stockman also wrote that the treaty "sets the stage for confiscation on a global scale." A "gun registry" might facilitate that by telling the United Nations where everybody’s guns are. We wondered whether the treaty really creates a registry. We did not hear back from Stockman or the association about this claim, so we were unable to determine when the letter was sent out or to verify it had not been altered. But the same claim appears on a web page at the association’s site with a shorter version of the letter also attributed to Stockman. PolitiFact has looked at similar claims about the United Nations before, most recently finding that a letter supposedly outlining a U.N. plan to "disarm civilians" was fake. In December 2012, PolitiFact Texas rated as Pants on Fire a chain email saying the Obama administration planned to use international treaties to ban all U.S. weapons. And in August 2012, PolitiFact Georgia tackled a claim very similar to Stockman’s. Georgia Republican U.S. Rep. Paul Broun said in a video from the same gun-rights group Stockman was supporting, "If passed by the U.N. and ratified by the U.S. Senate, the U.N. Small Arms Treaty would almost certainly force the United States to … create an international gun registry, setting the stage for full-scale gun confiscation." PolitiFact Georgia rated that claim, including its implication of confiscating guns, as False. Among its findings: A July 27, 2012, draft of an Arms Trade Treaty that failed to gain U.N. members’ approval would have required the U.S. to report information on international arms sales. Some background from that story: The U.N. has been working on a treaty to regulate the global arms trade -- not just small arms -- for years. Backers say it would curtail mass killings and terrorism and keep dictators from killing their own people. On April 2, 2013, according to the U.N.’s website, the organization’s General Assembly "adopted the landmark Arms Trade Treaty, regulating the international trade in conventional arms." The U.S. said "Yes" in that vote, and White House spokesman Jay Carney said Jun. 3, 2013, that President Barack Obama planned to sign the treaty "before the end of August," saying it was "in the interest of the United States." For the treaty to take force in the U.S., it would need to be ratified by the U.S. Senate, which on March 23, 2013, voted 53-46 to insert its formal opposition to the treaty into Senate spending legislation. The text of the treaty says its purpose is to regulate the international arms trade and prevent illicit sales and transfers. It applies to arms, ammunition and parts moving across a national border, specifically conventional arms in categories such as "warships," "combat aircraft" and "small arms and light weapons." The treaty requires nations to deny authorization to exports of such armaments if they will be used for terrorism, to commit genocide, to attack civilians or in other war crimes, and to take "appropriate measures" if they detect that a shipment has been diverted. Nations are required to maintain a "national control system, including a national control list," report exports and imports to the U.N. each year and regulate brokering with measures that "may include requiring brokers to register," but the treaty doesn’t specify how countries must carry out these directions. Daniel Prins, chief of the Conventional Arms branch of the U.N. Office for Disarmament Affairs, told us by phone that the national control list will be "an enumeration of the types of weapons you will report," starting with the categories in the treaty (warships, combat aircraft, etc.). Then, each year, nations will report imports and exports in the categories on their lists, Prins said: "35 tanks to Germany," for example. Countries can be more specific, but it’s up to them, he said. The treaty emphasizes that the U.N. is leaving regulation of the arms trade within a country entirely up to that country. The preamble says the parties to the treaty reaffirm "the sovereign right of any state" to regulate arms in its own territory "pursuant to its own legal or constitutional system." It also says the parties are "mindful of legitimate trade and lawful ownership." Article 12 of the treaty requires member nations to keep records of exports and says each country "is encouraged" to keep records on arms transferred into or authorized to ship through "territory under its jurisdiction." Countries are "encouraged to include in those records" the "quantity, value, model/type," the exporting and importing countries and "end users, as appropriate." Stockman’s letter includes some of the language in Article 12. Stockman wrote, "The registry must include the ‘quantity, value, model/type, authorized international transfers of conventional arms’ and the identity of the ‘end user.’ " But in the treaty, recording those details is "encouraged," not required. Though Article 12 deals primarily with exports, its language also encourages keeping records -- possibly including "end users" -- on arms transferred into a country. Prins said the importers, exporters and "end users" referred to in the treaty will most often be nations, not individuals. "This is a treaty on conventional arms, so it’s about battle tanks and attack helicopters and all that stuff," as well as small arms, Prins said. "For each individual weapons system that you export, you want to see where that ends up and where it’s being used." Giving a hypothetical example, he said, "If you send that to Sudan and the next moment you see it actually popping up in Chad, then we have an ‘end use’ issue. Because if all went well, (Sudan has) signed an end-user certificate on that transaction," meaning "they are supposed to be the last owner and user." If the weapons system were used by another country, that would be a breach of contract. He said there should be no effect on, for example, a U.S. citizen buying a gun from a foreign broker because "whatever broker you engage will need to be registered already with the U.S. government to be able to function as an arms broker." That’s because the U.S. has some of the strongest arms import and export legislation in the world, he said. With this treaty, Prins said, "we’re trying to get the world to adopt a transfer system that comes closer to what the U.S. already has." Our ruling Stockman said a U.N. treaty is "mandating a new international gun registry." His claim takes a treaty intended to curtail illicit weapons trade between countries and describes it as a step toward confiscating gun owners’ property. Nations that ratify the Arms Trade Treaty must track conventional arms that move across their borders, share some information about the transfers with the U.N. and other countries, then report the imports and exports in broad categories such as "battle tanks" to the U.N. each year. They must also regulate brokers, but requiring them to "register" is optional. Recording details such as the quantity and model of weapons in a shipment is also optional. We rate Stockman’s claim as False. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-03346	"Since I was elected, crime rates have been at their lowest in over a decade."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/jul/19/bill-foster/bill-foster-says-st-petersburg-crime-rates-have-be/	St. Petersburg Mayor Bill Foster is arming himself for re-election with a line about less crime in the city. "Since I was elected, crime rates have been at their lowest in over a decade," he said in a campaign brochure. PolitiFact Florida is keeping an ear out for claims by St. Petersburg mayoral candidates ahead of this year’s election. In this case, we already know the state’s crime rate is at a 42-year low from news reports and a previous fact-check of Gov. Rick Scott. We wanted to look at Foster’s claim about falling St. Petersburg crime and his actions to influence it. We turned to crime reports filed by the St. Petersburg Police Department to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. We searched offenses, which include both arrests and crimes in which no arrest was made, going back to 2002. Using that data, St. Petersburg’s crime rate yo-yoed from 2002-04 before decreasing steadily until 2008. The crime rate spiked in 2009, largely due to an increase in aggravated assault, larceny, burglary and stolen cars. What happened in 2010, Foster’s first full year in office? The crime rate plunged to at least a 10-year low. The rate fell again in 2011 and again in 2012. The biggest drop-offs occurred in the number of motor vehicle thefts, aggravated assaults, larcenies, burglaries and robberies, data show. Here’s a chart that shows the decline: Crime rate per 100,000 residents 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 8354 8121 8429 7980 7931 7506 7465 8255 6727 6226 5931 What’s happening in St. Petersburg is happening across the country, so it’s tough to figure out how much of an effect local law enforcement plays. The national crime rate has been declining over the past 20 years and is at its lowest points in some kinds of crime since the early 1960s, said William Ruefle, a University of South Florida St. Petersburg criminology professor who analyzes local crime. Ruefle credits modern, smarter policing. There’s also the all-time high rates of imprisonment around the country. A small number of people commit most crimes, so if they’re locked up, there will likely be fewer infractions, he said. When we asked Foster about his initiatives to reduce crime, he directed us to responses to two questions in his Tampa Bay Times editorial board questionnaire about the city’s homelessness issue. Foster pointed to several anti-crime initiatives that happened during his tenure, including a ban on panhandling; a joint police department-sheriff’s office task force focused on violent crime; new security cameras (thanks to Republican National Convention dollars); the creation of a gun bounty program targeting weapons owned illegally; adding a late-night downtown patrol unit to accommodate later bar hours; and establishing a squad that aims to address crime where it’s trending. Should Foster take the credit for declining crime? To a degree, experts said. Most of the ideas came from experts at the police department, said St. Petersburg police Chief Chuck Harmon, who has led the department since 2001. He credited Foster as being a good listener with a keen interest in crime around the city. (According to Harmon, Foster is the first mayor to get his own radio call sign. It’s X-0.) "He knew what the problem was, but it was my staff’s job to come up with the solution," Harmon said. "I will say he’s been involved with all of those things he talked about in one way or another. He could nix it if he didn’t like it." Police officials have "been scratching our heads" trying to figure out what’s driving the drop, Harmon said. Even though he can’t give a definitive reason for the big drop-off, he said the department has tried new tactics in recent years. For example, police are better monitoring offenders on probation and parole, which played a role in significantly reducing car thefts, he said. And a new unit created in the spring responded to an uptick in auto thefts during the first few months of 2013 -- most of which involved the driver leaving keys in the ignition while running into a convenience store -- by posting reminders at gas stations and on social media. "Crime prevention isn’t rocket science, but sometimes you just have to remind people: Don’t leave your keys in your car," said police spokesman Bill Proffitt. Foster wants to expand the department, which has applied for a four-year federal grant that would allow the city to add five more police officers. That would bring the force to 550 officers. Ruefle said honing in on crime spots are most likely to have an effect on addressing crime. Foster’s actions on the homeless population have also had some effect on crime, he said, as homeless residents were responsible for 15 percent of the city’s arrests and "it is much lower now." Still, it’s hard to say precisely what effect any of these policies have on the falling crime rate, he said. The big question: How long will the drop last? Both Harmon and Ruefle said it can’t keep going down at this pace. Harmon expects an increase in cybercrime will present the department with new challenges. In fact, police officials reported on July 10, 2013, that crime is up 6.2 percent for the first six months of 2013 compared to the first six months of 2012. The city, however, is still on pace to have a lower crime rate in 2013 than it did in the years before Foster took office. Our ruling Foster said, "Since I was elected, crime rates have been at their lowest in over a decade." On the numbers, Foster is accurate. The crime rate is at its lowest since at least 2000. But in judging claims like these, we also must consider whether Foster is right to take credit for the drop. On that front, it’s a bit of a mixed bag. Yes, the mayor helped institute a number of new crime-fighting measures. But crime rates are down across the country, and it’s unclear how much the new crime-fighting tools helped St. Petersburg’s decline. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-11980	While Mayor Rick Kriseman said he would dip into reserves this year because of Hurricane Irma, he "went into the emergency reserves before Irma ever hit."	true	/florida/statements/2017/sep/29/rick-baker/rick-baker-says-kriseman-tapped-reserves-irma-hes-/	St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman and former Mayor Rick Baker offered conflicting stories about the city’s budget at their first mayoral forum since the August primary election. According to Baker, Kriseman tapped into emergency reserves this year in order to balance the city’s budget, despite record revenues. Kriseman defended himself by implying that the reach for reserves had not yet happened: "We’ve been investing in reserves every year. If we go and have to dip into reserves for this year it will be because of Hurricane Irma and the losses that have been sustained by the city in overtime." Baker didn’t let Kriseman have the last word. "Mr. Kriseman must be able to read the future, because he went into the emergency reserves before Irma ever hit," Baker said. "I don’t know how he did that." Many in the audience erupted into laughter and clapped for Baker. But was Baker’s retort right? Show us the money Basically, we found that the city has tapped into reserves. The city has plans to repay the loans. In May, the city council approved the transfer of $7.6 million to the Water Resources Capital Projects Fund to expedite infrastructure upgrades, which included projects to increase capacity at the water reclamation facilities. Half of the $7.6 million ($3.8 million) was taken out of the city’s economic stability fund — one of several types of reserve funds, and one specifically meant to cushion city coffers against economic downturns and natural disasters. The other half came from a different pot of money: the Water Resources department’s operating fund. The fund had an unappropriated balance, which, by definition, is not technically a reserve. (The Water Resources Department manages the city’s sewage and almost like an independent business.) Even though the city does not define this pool of money as reserves, some leaders consider it one and the same. In a Tampa Bay Times article, city council member Ed Montanari described the whole $7.6 million as reserves. There are many rules that govern whether reserves from the economic stability fund can be used, and one of the more relevant ones for this fact-check is the requirement for the city to repay the $3.8 million loan. That rules applies to reserves in the economic stability fund, but the city still hopes and has plans to replenish the whole $7.6 million loan after Water Resources department issues bonds. City officials said that would be in next couple months. So in this case, the city would issue bonds and sell them to investors. The city will pay back the the investors who bought one of those bonds in chunks. So the city is replenishing the money with more borrowed money. Kriseman’s team considers this "paying back" the loan, but that’s not how everyone in the city sees it. Montanari told the Tampa Bay Times he didn't agree with the city's decision to take $7.6 million to pay for sewer projects. "I don't like the fact that we're taking money from reserves and replacing it with borrowed money," Montanari told the Times. "I just want to state that on the record." So, if the city already tapped into reserves, why did Kriseman make it seem like it hadn’t? Kriseman’s campaign clarified that his comments about reserves were "strictly about the city response to Hurricane Irma." "While the city has not yet utilized the emergency reserves for Hurricane Irma, it is very likely that we will," said Kriseman spokesperson Ben Kirby. Kirby said the city will probably have to allocate reserves to pay city workers for the overtime they worked during the storm. He added that the majority of eligible expenses can be reimbursed by Federal Emergency Management Agency. Since Irma hit, the city requested FEMA assistance. Our ruling Baker claimed that Kriseman tapped into reserves before Hurricane Irma ever hit. That is accurate. Under Kriseman, the city tapped into reserves early this year to cover the costs of infrastructure upgrades, which included projects to increase capacity at the water reclamation facilities. The the city plans to issue bonds to repay the loan, but there’s no saying when that will happen. Furthermore, bonds are just borrowed money. We rate this claim True.

pomt-00444	"California is proposing to legislate what drinks restaurants can serve your kids, only giving two options: milk or water."	mostly false	/california/statements/2018/aug/21/fox-news-channel/misleading-claim-fox-friends-california-kids-meal-/	Would a California bill really limit restaurant drink options for children to "only milk and water"? That’s the impression left by a recent segment on "Fox & Friends", an influential show that’s sometimes live-tweeted by President Trump. "This is a state that can run amok with the regulations and the nanny state. Now they want to legislate what drinks kids can get at restaurants," claimed host Ed Henry early in the segment. "There’s a bill that’s been proposed in the state of California (that would) only give children two options at restaurants: either milk or water," he continued. A second host then adds: "Of course, obviously, I’m the parent, I want to be able to make that decision. Where does it go? Some people in California think dairy is bad… . Or maybe it’s wheat. So how far will this go? That’s the question." We wanted to know: Does the bill really restrict kids drinks to only milk or water? Or is there more to the legislation? We set out on a fact check. Our research The legislation in question is Senate Bill 1192 introduced by Democratic State Sen. Bill Monning. He has championed it as a way to encourage healthy beverage options for children. The bill has gained attention from many news outlets in addition to Fox and many have offered misleading or incomplete ways to describe the legislation. The bill received final approval from the California Legislature on Aug. 21 and was sent to Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown's desk for consideration. Here’s part of what the bill says: "This bill would require a restaurant, as defined, that sells a children’s meal that includes a beverage, to make the default beverage water, sparkling water, or flavored water, as specified, or unflavored milk or a nondairy milk alternative, as specified." The Fox hosts generally get that portion of the bill correct. But they leave out, until the end of the segment, any reference to a key provision of the bill: "The bill would not prohibit a restaurant’s ability to sell, or a customer’s ability to purchase, an alternative beverage if the purchaser requests one." The hosts also fail to mention that the bill applies only to restaurants with kids menus, though a chyron on the screen does reference kids’ meals. A third host near the end of the segment added: "The parents have to actively ask to have soda for their children." Based on the bill, and if their child is having a kids meal, that appears to be correct. Some restaurants have already removed soda from their kids meal menus. McDonald’s, for example, removed it in 2013, though the restaurant doesn’t turn down parents who ask for sodas with their child’s Happy Meal. A Fox News spokeswoman declined to speak on the record about the show’s presentation of the bill. Fox wasn't the only news outlet to leave the wrong impression. TheHill.com, a political news site, tweeted "California bill blocks restaurants from serving kids anything to drink but water, milk." Meanwhile, a patch.com news headline read "Kids Menus Can Only Have Water, Milk Under California Bill." In an interview, Monning described the Fox segment as "misleading." He added that "Fox & Friends" appeared to have shaped the story "to fit preconceived notions" about the proposal. Numerous health organizations support the bill and there’s no known opposition from other interest groups, according to reports by state Senate and Assembly committee staff. Our ruling During a recent "Fox & Friends" segment and on the show’s Twitter page, the claim was made: "California is proposing to legislate what drinks restaurants can serve your kids, only giving two options: milk or water." The claim ignores the critical fact that the bill allows restaurants, upon request, to serve children other drinks such as juice or soda. It also disregards the fact that the bill would only apply to restaurants with a kids menu. Two of the show’s hosts, along with a tweet following the segment, offered deceptive portrayals of the bill, leaving the average person with the impression it could be milk, water or nothing for kids at California restaurants. A third host then noted parents could still request soda for their children. That clarification, buried near the end of the segment, doesn’t balance out an otherwise misleading presentation. We rate the show's claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-12206	Preliminary murder rates in Philadelphia "will put the murder rate at the highest of this decade in the city."	mostly false	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/jul/24/jeff-sessions/will-phillys-murder-rate-be-highest-decade-ag-jeff/	On Friday, another member of the Trump administration discussed crime in Philly. In town for a speech to law enforcement officials, US Attorney General Jeff Sessions started talking about violent crime, similar to the way his boss did in January at the GOP Retreat. Back then, Trump made a statement we at PolitiFact PA quickly decided was false, saying, "Here in Philadelphia the murder has been steady — I mean — just terribly increasing." Sessions said, "Preliminary data show murders are up 20 percent from last year. It will put the murder rate at the highest this decade in the city." First off, the murder rate is up 20 percent so far this year. The morning he was speaking, it was actually up 21 percent over the same day as last year and has hovered near 20 every day for at least the last several weeks. But here we are fact-checking the latter part of the statement: whether the homicide rate this year will be the highest of this decade so far and whether it’s reasonable to make such a projection. When Sessions spoke Friday morning, the homicide count for Philadelphia was 174, according to the Philadelphia Police Department. Given 201 days had so far lapsed this year at that point, Philadelphia had experienced about .87 homicides per day. That rate would lead to 315 or 316 homicides by the end of the year. The total would not be enough to be considered the highest of the 2010s decade, or for the 10-year period of 2008 to 2017. In 2011, 326 homicides occurred here. In 2012, the number was 331. The projected total of 316 would be about 5 percent lower than either of those years, but higher than in any other year of this decade so far. But the other question is whether the number says anything meaningful at this point in the year. "There is so much variability in a low-volume crime such as homicide," said Jerry Ratcliffe, a criminal justice professor at Temple, "that predicting months ahead isn’t wise." Indeed, last year’s homicide total appeared to be rising compared to 2015 about midway through the year. As of September 2016, the rate was 9 percent higher than at the same time period the previous year. But by 2016’s end, Philly had 278 homicides, two fewer than in 2015. Ratcliffe has written extensively on this subject and found making early comparisons irrelevant because of fluctuations that are difficult to gauge. In January and February 2014, for instance, Philly saw about 37 percent more homicides than it did in January and February of 2013. But by the end of the year the city’s homicide rate ended up 0.4 percent higher than in 2013. Had Sessions even made his comment just two days later, the homicide total of 174 would have been the same, per Philly Police statistics. But because it was two days later in the year, the year-over-year increase had changed to 17 percent and the projected year-end count to 312 or 313 because of a drop to about .85 homicides per day. Our Ruling Sessions said of Philly, "Preliminary data show that murders are up at a rate of 20 percent from last year, which will put the murder rate at the highest of this decade in the city." Homicides are up about 20 percent — and consistently have been for some time — but the latter half of his statement is wrong. With 174 murders as of 11:59 p.m. Thursday, Philly was on pace to see about 316 by year’s end. The total would be lower than in 2011 (326) and 2012 (331). That’s not a sizable gap but still wouldn’t put the homicide count at the highest of this decade. On top of that, the merits of making such projections are questionable, given the high variability of homicide. We rule the claim Mostly False.

pomt-06540	"Republicans enacted the most drastic cuts to K-12 public schools of any state in the nation."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/oct/05/mark-miller/mark-miller-says-wisconsin-republicans-enacted-mos/	When Wisconsin’s monthly unemployment numbers for August took another bad turn, both major political parties scrambled to affix blame. Republican Governor Scott Walker pointed at "problems in the national economy" in his weekly radio address on Sept. 22, 2011. Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Mark Miller, D-Monona, fingered the Republican agenda of budget cuts and tax breaks for businesses for failing to create family supporting jobs. Miller tucked another element -- the impact on education -- into the Democrats’ weekly radio address the same day: "While voting for over $2.3 billion in tax giveaways, Republicans enacted the most drastic cuts to K-12 public schools of any state in the nation." We’ve already checked a variation of the tax-break claim -- the liberal group One Wisconsin Now said that Walker’s budget "includes tax breaks for corporations and the rich that will cost the state of Wisconsin taxpayers $2.3 billion over the next decade." The $2.3 billion figure is indeed the projected revenue loss, but the loss is from separate GOP-sponsored legislation as well as the budget. We rated that statement Half True. Miller, though, doesn't mention the 10-year period, so that takes the first part of his statement even more off the mark. But what about the education-related cuts? Were they the "most drastic cuts to K-12 public schools of any state in the nation"? And by what measure? Miller pointed us to a September 2011 study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities that compared state-by-state budget cuts. He specifically noted media coverage of the study in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Madison’s Capital Times and the Wisconsin Radio Network -- all of which emphasized the #1 ranking in either a headline or first paragraph. Let’s take a deeper look. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, obtained budget data from 24 states -- not all 50 -- in conducting what experts told us was the only study that has attempted to quantify the recession-era cutbacks by state governments in aid to local schools. The group analyzed state general education funding that is sent to local schools using formulas and ranked states by two measures. It did not attempt to catalog how much individual school districts might have saved in costs due to limits on collective bargaining included in Walker’s budget-repair bill. But, that is potentially important. The state money to local schools was cut, but many districts were able to use the new freedom from union contracts to cut their own budgets to recover some or even all of the lost state aid. That limited the overall negative impact on the classroom. The study is ongoing, as the group is trying to gather information from the remaining 26 states. For those states, the information was not yet available or there were other obstacles to crunching the numbers, said Phil Oliff, a policy analyst who co-authored the study. The study found that Wisconsin had plenty of company in cutting aid for 2011-12 over the previous year -- 21 of the 24 states have cut per-student funding to some degree. The study noted: "Some of the deepest reductions to K-12 formula funding since the onset of the recession have occurred in the past year, as federal aid intended to sustain state education spending has expired, rainy day funds have been exhausted, and states have resisted raising additional taxes to offset the need for cuts." It ranked Wisconsin’s cuts as third deepest in percent change in spending per student (10.0%). The study highlighted this finding: "Of the states surveyed, the three states that reduced per student funding the most since last year are Illinois, Texas, and Wisconsin." So, it’s a poor ranking, to be sure. But that’s not Number 1. By another measure, Wisconsin was Number 1 -- the dollar change per student (-$635). This was covered in a chart in the study and that is what drew the headlines -- and Miller’s attention. Oliff told us that both measures were useful, just from different perspectives. A prominent Wisconsin education funding researcher who reviewed the group’s numbers, University of Wisconsin-Madison professor Andrew Reschovsky, agreed both measures are important. "The bottom line is Wisconsin has made very deep cuts, either year over year or compared to pre-recession (levels)," Oliff told us. "Some of the deepest cuts in the nation." We asked Reschovsky how he would characterize Wisconsin’s rankings based on the study. "I'd be comfortable saying that among the 24 states they studied, and focusing only on aid, Wisconsin has cut state aid more dramatically than most of those other states," Reschovsky said. That's some of the deepest cuts, and deeper than most other states, but not the deepest. The Journal Sentinel’s story on Sept. 6, 2011 led with "Wisconsin leads the country so far this year in cuts to state aid for schools" -- but immediately noted the study was limited to 24 states. The story also noted the #3 ranking on the other measure. The headline was less specific: "Wisconsin ranks high in school aid cuts." The Capital Times piece the same day led with the dollar change (#1) under this headline: "Wisconsin’s cuts to school aid steepest of 24 states studied." The next day, the Wisconsin Radio Network’s website said: "Wisconsin K-12 funding cuts lead the nation." The WRN story led off: "Wisconsin’s cuts to school aid are the deepest among 24 states where budget information is available, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities." Like the others, it also prominently noted the limits of the study -- 26 states are not included. We asked Miller’s office how he could say the cuts were the most drastic "of any state" when the study looked at only 24 states. Miller spokesman Michael Browne told us that by saying "Republicans enacted" the deepest cuts, Miller had provided listeners with the appropriate context. "Enacted" signals that Miller was talking about the deepest cuts just among those states that had acted, Browne argued. But that doesn’t square with why the study was limited to 24 states. Some others have acted, but the data is just not available or has not been analyzed. And it’s reasonable to think some or many have cut education funding, said Oliff. Our conclusion Miller took to the airwaves to say that "Republicans enacted the most drastic cuts to K-12 public schools of any state in the nation." He cited media reports concerning a study by a liberal think tank. Researchers we consulted poked no holes in the study, but it only covered about half the states. And while Wisconsin did indeed lead in cuts by one measure, it was third according to a second measure that is highlighted in the group’s report. There’s an element of truth in Miller’s claim, but he pushed past the limits of the study. We rate the statement Mostly False.	None	Mark Miller	None	None	None	2011-10-05T09:00:00	2011-09-22	['None']
pomt-08081	TSA "started off with 16,500 screeners and the agency has mushroomed to 67,000 employees with 3,590 administrative people ... making over $105,000 per year on average."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/dec/17/john-mica/us-rep-john-mica-says-tsa-growing-and-growing-and-/	A northeast Florida congressman is taking aim at the Transportation Security Administration, saying the government agency has grown too big. U.S. Rep. John Mica, the incoming House Transportation Committee chairman, launched a series of criticisms about TSA surrounding its new screening procedures -- including potentially invasive pat-down searches. Classic government run amok, he says. TSA "started off with 16,500 screeners and the agency has mushroomed to 67,000 employees with 3,590 administrative people ... making over $105,000 per year on average," Mica said during a Nov. 25, 2010, appearance on Fox News. Mica has suggested the federal government might be better off training private airport security screeners and then slowly backing out of the process, saying a public-private partnership would be more efficient and less costly. "It would be far better for a streamlined TSA to focus on setting and checking security standards and auditing performance, rather than spending much of its time, resources and energy on managing a huge ballooning bureaucracy," Mica wrote in a Nov. 23, 2010, guest column in USA Today. We'll leave the policy debate for the policy debaters, but we wanted to see if Mica's TSA stats are correct. Has the aviation security screening force grown from about 16,500 to a bureaucracy of 67,000? And do TSA's administrative personnel in Washington, D.C., make $105,000 a year on average? First, some quick background on the TSA. Prior to Sept. 11, 2001, airport security was performed by air carriers with oversight from the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA essentially provided the guidelines for passenger and luggage screening, and it was up to the air carriers to perform the screening itself. In most cases, carriers contracted that work out to third-party security companies. Results were mixed. In 1978, the FAA found that screeners missed identifying prohibited items during checks 13 percent of the time -- a rate considered "significant and alarming" by both the FAA and the airline industry. In two 1987 reports, the U.S. General Accounting Office pointed out that about 20 percent of test objects were still not being identified during the screening process. After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the federal government created the Transportation Security Administration to directly handle security screening. Which segues perfectly to Mica's statements. Justin Harclerode, Mica's spokesman on the Transportation Committee, said Mica got his figures from TSA itself -- with one caveat. "When Mr. Mica cites 67,000, he usually indicates that we are growing TSA to that level, because in its FY 2011 budget, the administration requested funding and justifications (more screening equipment operators, more canine unit staff, more behavior detection officers) for a TSA staff of over 67,000. The current staff is about 62,000 (a massive bureaucracy already) and the administration has requested funding to grow it to over 67,000," Harclerode said. We showed Mica's statement to the TSA and asked for clarification on his figures. TSA spokeswoman Sari Koshetz told PolitiFact Florida that the TSA total workforce is about 62,000. But Harclerode is right that TSA wants to grow. In its FY 2011 budget submittal, TSA asks for funding to grow the agency by about 4,500 employees (page 72 of this request). As for the headquarters staff, Mica is pretty much right on, TSA admits. The TSA headquarters workforce is approximately 3,650 (Mica said 3,590) and the average salary for employees there is $105,000 (exactly what Mica said). That's one part of Mica's statement. The other examines how the TSA has grown since 2001. How do things measure up there? Mica is right that in August 2002, nine months after TSA was created, the agency was operating with 16,500 screeners. But it's a misleading claim. The agency was known to be expanding. Let us explain. TSA was created in November 2001 as part of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act. That legislation required that all airport security screeners be federal employees by Nov. 19, 2002. In the year between the congressional act and the deadline, the TSA slowly built its ranks, mixing federal employees with private security workers. At one point in August 2002, that mix included 16,500 federal workers. But it always was going to be more. By the end of 2002, TSA reported employing 56,000 security screeners. The agency shrunk some in 2003 as part of "rightsizing" but has slowly grown since then. In 2003, Congress placed a 45,000-employee cap on the agency, but TSA found ways around the cap, which was removed in 2007. What does that mean for Mica? Well, he said, TSA "started off with 16,500 screeners and the agency has mushroomed to 67,000 employees with 3,590 administrative people ... making over $105,000 per year on average." Little variances on the numbers aside, we take issue with the suggestion that TSA grew from 16,500 to a bulging 67,000-employee bureaucracy. TSA may have had 16,500 screeners in its infancy, but it was created with the idea that it would have many more. Mica is cherry-picking some numbers in his statement. So we rate it Half True.

pomt-01675	On offshore drilling for energy	no flip	/virginia/statements/2014/aug/18/mark-warner/warner-has-remained-steady-support-offshore-drilli/	Republican challenger Ed Gillespie says there’s a gap between U.S. Sen. Mark Warner’s professed support of offshore drilling for energy resources and his voting record. Here are Gillespie’s words from a July 26 debate with Warner, a Democrat: "When it comes to offshore drilling, Sen. Warner just said that he supports it, and I know that he has said that, but in fact in 2012, there was a vote for drilling for more oil and gas throughout the Outer Continental Shelf. Five Democrats voted for it, including Jim Webb (of Virginia). Sen. Warner voted against it." Warner replied that his stance has been steady. "On offshore oil, I’ve had legislation for that for years," he said. "But I do believe that Virginia should get a share of the royalties. The bill that Ed mentioned didn’t include that." So we wheeled out the Flip-O-Meter to measure Warner’s consistency on the issue. Gillespie, according to his campaign spokesman, was referring to a March 2012 vote on an amendment to a transportation funding bill. The amendment -- offered by Sen. David Vitter, R-La. -- would have re-opened the Outer Continental Shelf around the U.S. for drilling according to a five-year period originally designed to start in 2010. Virginia was included in that plan, but President Barack Obama put it on hold after the catastrophic Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Gillespie got Warner’s vote right -- he opposed the amendment, which did not pass. Three Democrats, including Webb, supported it. But the vote does not show waffling on Warner’s part. We read Vitter’s two-paragraph amendment; it did not seek revenue-sharing for coastal states. Warner, at the time of the vote, cited the omission as his reason for opposing the amendment. It’s been estimated that Virginia could receive as much as $250 million a year if the federal government gave it the same royalty rights it has granted to Gulf Coast states for oil and natural gas extracted off their coasts. Warner’s campaign sent us a list of the senator’s actions in supporting offshore drilling with the proviso that royalties are shared with affected coastal states: *Warner introduced legislation that would expand offshore drilling in 2013 and co-sponsored bills to that effect in 2012 and 2011. *He joined other senators in signing letters to the Secretary of Interior in signed 2012 and 2014 supporting drilling and urging that Virginia be included in the nation’s offshore plan. We spoke to Glen Besa, director of the Sierra Club’s Virginia chapter, which strongly opposes offshore drilling. "I’ve been disappointed in Mark Warner’s support for offshore drilling," Besa said. "He’s been painfully consistent as far as we’re concerned, and on the wrong side of the issue." It should be noted that Gillespie, prior to becoming a Senate candidate, characterized Warner as an offshore drilling advocate. This occurred on Sept. 17, 2012, when Gillespie held a telephone conference with national reporters to outline positions being taken by Mitt Romney, the GOP’s presidential nominee. It was six months after Warner had voted against Vitter’s amendment. "We’ll allow for drilling off the coast off the coast of Virginia, which both Democratic senators and the Republican governor are asking for," Gillespie said, according to a transcript of the event. At the time, Virginia’s Democratic senators were Warner and Webb. The Republican governor was Bob McDonnell. Our ruling Warner’s record is consistent: He supports offshore drilling but insists that states, including Virginia, receive royalties for oil and natural gas extracted off their coasts.

pomt-12269	Australia is microchipping its public.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/06/blog-posting/no-australian-government-not-installing-microchips/	A fake item circulating online gives the false impression the Australian government is implanting microchips in its citizens. "Australia becomes first country to begin microchipping its public," blares one such false headline appearing on the site Native American Stuff. We decided to take a closer look after Facebook users flagged it as suspicious. Microchips implanted in human bodies can transform how people tackle everyday tasks. They emit frequencies that do everything from unlocking doors to logging onto computers, removing the need to turn a key or flip a switch. While it’s true some people have voluntarily been implanted, there’s not a shred of evidence to support the absurd notion that the procedure is mandatory in Australia, as this story claims. The fake item appears to be a gross distortion of a puff piece from an actual Australian media outlet about an entrepreneur from Sydney who runs a business implanting microchips in customers’ skin. But there’s no evidence that the tech entrepreneur or her chip-implanting business are acting on behalf of the government of Australia, or that customers sought her service because a government policy requires them to do so. This bogus item follows a familiar fake news formula, wending its way from a shocking, clickbait-y headline, through muddled reasoning that attempts to support an ultimately untenable central premise.

pomt-04172	Says Massachusetts has three state-mandated student tests and Finland just one.	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/dec/17/thomas-ratliff/thomas-ratliff-says-massachusetts-imposes-three-ma/	Saying Texas students face too many state-mandated exams, an East Texas member of the State Board of Education suggested two faraway places enjoy stellar results with minimal government-imposed testing. In an opinion column published in the Dec. 10, 2012, Austin American-Statesman, Thomas Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant, said: "Massachusetts, the envy of all public school systems in the United States, has three state-mandated tests. Finland, which is the envy of all public school systems in the world, has one. That’s right, one." We're not going to judge the merits of educational systems. But we have experience counting tests. In August 2012, we rated False a claim that Texas students spend 45 days a year on state-ordered exams after earlier rating Mostly False a claim about the number of testing days in the Austin schools. Yet, as we tucked into this Massachusetts-Finland shout, we noticed Ratliff’s article does not say if he’s critical of every exam given under the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness system. That testing starts in the third grade. By phone, Ratliff told us that he was thinking only of the state's 11 to 15 newly-installed end-of-course exams that high-school students must hurdle to qualify for graduation. So, what of Massachusetts and Finland? Ratliff said he drew his Massachusetts test count from Austin lawyer Dineen Majcher, who helped launch Texans Advocating for Meaningful Student Assessment amid concerns the 2009 Legislature's overhaul of student testing and accountability went overboard. Majcher pointed us to a Massachusetts government web page, for the Bay State’s Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, indicating that high-school students should attain "proficient" scores on tests in English language arts and math and a test in any of several science-oriented subjects: biology, chemistry, introductory physics or technology/engineering. Students who do not meet the state’s "proficient" score on either test can still graduate, according to the agency, by fulfilling an educational proficiency plan entailing more classwork and testing. By email, department spokesman J.C. Considine told us that outside of the state’s high-school tests, students in grades three through eight must take standardized state exams. According to an agency web page, results are used to hold schools accountable for progress toward the federal goal that all U.S. students be proficient in reading and math by 2014. Now let’s flip to Finland. Ratliff pointed us to an article in the September 2011 issue of Smithsonian, the magazine produced by the Smithsonian Institution, saying that students there have outperformed counterparts in other countries thanks to in a focus on well-prepared teachers who decide how best to school their individual pupils. The story also says there "are no mandated standardized tests in Finland, apart from one exam at the end of students’ senior year in high school." The test is the Finnish Matriculation Exam, according to a Finnish government web page, which says the exam’s purpose is to "discover whether pupils have assimilated the knowledge and skills required by the curriculum for the upper secondary school and whether they have reached an adequate level of maturity in line with that school`s goals. Passing the Matriculation Examination entitles the candidate to continue his or her studies at university." According to the web page, the exam is given each spring and fall. However, the exam is not a one-and-done. It’s composed of "at least four tests," one that each student must take in his or her "mother tongue"—Finnish, Swedish or Saami—and three others at their choice either on the "second national language" or a foreign language; math; or a test in the sciences and humanities, according to the web page, including tests in Evangelical Lutheran religion, Orthodox religion, ethics, philosophy, psychology, history, social studies, physics, chemistry, biology, geography and health education. "As part of his or her examination, the candidate may additionally include one or more optional tests," the web page says. Whoa. Could each student really take more than 10 tests? Pasi Sahlberg, a Finnish expert in education and director general of the Helsinki-based Centre for International Mobility and Cooperation, confirmed by email that the overall standardized exam consists of a minimum of four tests, but students "if they wish can take more exams." Typically, he said, students take five or six tests. These may be spread over a 12-month period, he said, though most students take most of their tests in the spring of their last school year. Notably, too, Sahlberg emailed, Finnish students who focus on vocational training after completing the country’s nine mandatory years of basic education do not have to take a state-mandated exam of any kind. In 2010, 45 percent of the students who continued their schooling after the nine years chose the vocational track, Satu Mäki-Lassila of Finland’s Ministry of Education and Culture told us by email. Our ruling Ratliff wrote that Massachusetts has three mandated student tests and Finland one. Both claims reflect the exams that students in Massachusetts and Finland have to take to qualify for high school graduation. But students on the academic track in Finland must take at least four separate tests. Also, given that Ratliff’s article does not say he’s speaking only to tests administered in high school, it’s worth noting that Massachusetts, like Texas, requires students starting in third grade to take state tests. This claim grades out as Half True. CLARIFICATION, 10:00 a.m., Dec. 19, 2012: We amended this article to point out that Finnish students who focus on vocational courses at the secondary level do not have to take a government-mandated exam to graduate. This wrinkle, brought to our attention by a reader, did not change our Truth-O-Meter rating.	None	Thomas Ratliff	None	None	None	2012-12-17T10:00:00	2012-12-10	['Finland']
pomt-07435	"Right now we are spending at an all-time high, close to 25 percent of our GDP [is] being spent on the federal government. But our revenues are at an almost all-time low of about 15 percent [of GDP]."	true	/virginia/statements/2011/apr/22/mark-warner/mark-warner-says-federal-spending-near-all-time-hi/	In the coming weeks, U.S. Sen. Mark Warner and a bipartisan group of five colleagues are expected to introduce a tough-love plan for lowering debt that they promise will make everyone angry. Warner says his "Gang of Six" will propose an array of tax increases and spending reforms to entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security that would slice the national debt by $4 trillion over the next 10 years. He has been laying out the case for more taxes and less spending for months, calling the debt "a ticking time bomb." Warner appeared on "Face the Nation" on April 17 and told CBS newsman Bob Schieffer: "Right now we are spending at an all-time high; close to 25 percent of our GDP [is] being spent on the federal government. But our revenues are at an almost all-time low of about 15 percent [of GDP]." We wondered if he was right. GDP, or gross domestic product, is the measure of the total size of the U.S. economy during a given year. The Department of the Commerce has been tracking GDP since 1929. The Department of Treasury has been computing the size of government spending and revenues relative to GDP since 1940. It’s data backs up Warner’s contention. Rarely has government revenue been such a small portion of GDP, and rarely has spending been such a large chunk of the total economy. Let’s start with revenue. Ninety-three percent of federal receipts come from taxes on personal income, corporate income and payrolls. Uncle Sam took in $2.16 trillion during fiscal 2010, which ended Sept. 30. Revenues equaled 14.9 percent of GDP. In 2009 revenue was $2.11 trillion, again 14.9 percent of GDP. So both of those figures are close to the 15 percent mentioned by Warner. How do they compare to the past 70 years? The average since 1940 is 17.4 percent, and the average during the past 30 years is 18 percent. We found that revenue has not been below 15 percent of GDP since 1949 and 1950, when it checked in at 14.5 percent and 14.4 percent. During those post-World War II years, taxes were cut and the nation enjoyed rapid economic expansion. Medicare and Medicaid did not exist. There were 16 workers for each Social Security recipient, as compared to 2.9 workers per recipient today. The only other time where revenue was below the 15 percent level was 1940 through 1943, when the U.S. ran massive budget deficits to fund World War II. So Warner’s right when he says federal revenues "are at an almost all-time low." The revenue totals for 2009 and 2010 were the lowest percentage of GDP in 60 years. Now let’s look at spending. The federal government spent $3.46 trillion in fiscal 2010 fiscal year, down slightly from $3.52 trillion in the 2009 budget year. The 2010 figure was 23.8 percent of GDP, and the 2009 figure was 25 percent of GDP. Those numbers are above historical averages. Since 1940, federal spending has averaged 20.5 percent of GDP, and since 1981 the average is 21 percent. Spending under George W. Bush ranged from 18.2 percent in 2001 to a high of 20.7 percent in 2008. From 1980 through 2000, spending mostly ranged between 20 percent and 22 percent of GDP. Only during World War II did expenditures climb above Warner’s 25 percent threshold. It peaked at 43.6 percent in 1943 and 1944 as the U.S. financed much of its global war efforts with debt. By 1946 the figure was down to 24.8 percent, and in 1948, spending fell to 11.6 percent of GDP. Let’s wrap up. Mark Warner said government revenue is close to an all-time low at 15 percent of gross domestic product, while spending is at 25 percent of GDP, which Warner says is an all-time high. Revenue levels -- 93 percent of which come from taxes -- haven’t been this low in 60 years. So Warner is right. He also aces the spending side. The U.S. has only seen government outlays chew up this much of GDP once in history, at the height of World War II. We rate this statement True.

pomt-08541	"Social Security is a Ponzi scheme."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/oct/03/john-loughlin/loughlin-compares-social-security-ponzi-scheme/	As Democrats fight to hold on to Congressional seats across the country, they have repeatedly accused Republicans of trying to privatize or even do away with Social Security. We checked one such claim by Rhode Island candidate David Cicilline on Saturday. GOP candidates have struck back with their own charge: Social Security, they say, is like a Ponzi scheme. Cicilline's District 1 opponent, Republican John Loughlin, has drawn the parallel at least three times during his campaign. Last week, in an interview with PolitiFact Rhode Island, he went so far as to compare the U.S. government's administration of Social Security with the scheme committed by convicted fraudster Bernard Madoff whom he said "went to jail for doing the exact same thing this country is doing with Social Security." In perhaps the most extensive example, Loughlin had this to say while speaking in February at a Rhode Island Voter Coalition forum: "For those of you who haven't retired yet, Social Security is a Ponzi scheme. The people who are working are paying for the people who are retired. There is no Social Security trust fund per se. Your money doesn't go into a big bank and come out when you retire. You're hoping there will be enough young people working to be able to pay your Social Security when you retire. That, ladies and gentlemen, is a classic Ponzi scheme. It's a textbook definition." If he's right and Social Security is indeed a Ponzi scheme it would make Madoff's $65 billion fraud look like child's play. So PolitiFact Rhode Island decided to take a look. We had a little help on this one from our partners at PolitiFact Wisconsin, who conducted a thorough examination of the Ponzi scheme issue after a Senate candidate there made a similar claim. We'll borrow from them. Let's start with some history. The scheme is named for Charles Ponzi, a Boston swindler who conned investors out of millions by promising them returns of up to 100 percent in just a few short weeks, then instead of investing their money, he used it to fund his personal habits. Ponzi kept the scam going by bringing in new investors, whose money he used to pay off existing ones. The current definition on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission website identifies it this way: "A Ponzi scheme is an investment fraud that involves the payment of purported returns to existing investors from funds contributed by new investors." Sound familiar? Loughlin thinks so. He insists that's the same process used to finance the federal Social Security program. And he believes that when benefits owed exceed the money coming in, the system will fall apart. There are similarities. As PolitiFact Wisconsin notes, Social Security uses taxes on current wage earners to finance the retirement checks of millions of Americans. But what about Loughlin's assertion that there is no Social Security trust fund with which to pay back wage earners? In an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, a spokeswoman for the Social Security Administration said "The Social Security Trust Funds currently holds over $2.5 trillion in interest-bearing Treasury securities backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government." As Wisconsin notes, that essentially makes it an I.O.U. for current wage earners. But there is a second, critical component that defines a Ponzi scheme: fraud. To reach the level of this kind of scam, an investment setup must intentionally con investors, while making efforts to convince them that the finances are legitimate. Loughlin might say that's the case. And he's right to say the Social Security system is struggling financially as more Baby boomers reach retirement age. But that's very different than intentional deceit. In fact, Social Security was set up in the midst of the Depression to serve as an insurance plan of sorts for the elderly. Since then, participants and those who pay into the system have been well aware of how the program is run. For that reason, University of Rhode Island economics Prof. Rick McIntyre, called the comparison "unfair and inappropriate." A Ponzi scheme is guaranteed to run aground when the pool of investors is tapped out, whereas the Social Security administration's troubles could be remedied by raising taxes or other restructuring, should the federal government choose to do so, he said. "It is not a Ponzi scheme because there is no intent to deceive," McIntyre added. Mitchell Zuckoff, author of "Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend," and a URI graduate, addressed the persistent comparison in a recent interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin. "The important difference and the fundamental difference is that there is no secret to how Social Security is run," he said. "No one is being misled; no one is taking the money and running..." Without that key element of deceit, we find it hard to find Loughlin's analogy -- or that of anyone who uses it -- credible. But there's one more thing. Loughlin doesn't just compare Social Security to the Ponzi scheme concept, he takes it a step further and draws a parallel with the specific case of Madoff, who is believed to have run the largest fraud of this kind in history. Publicly measuring a 75-year-old U.S. government program against such a massive crime is not only overstating the issue, it's bordering on irresponsible. False.

pomt-00702	Tyler Perry’s plan to turn a majority of the former Fort McPherson into a film and television studio is expected "to add over 8,000 new jobs to Atlanta."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2015/may/01/city-atlanta/Studio-plan-jobs-claim-misleading/	Atlanta officials say they are likely only weeks away from closing the deal on the largest business investment to take place on Atlanta’s southside in decades. By mid-May, they hope to make official the sale of 330 acres at the Army’s former Fort McPherson to actor and filmmaker Tyler Perry. Perry, a multimillionaire and long-term Atlanta resident, is ready to pay $30 million for the property, which he plans to redevelop into a television and film studio. According to the city, he has already invested about $200 million in various entertainment ventures in Georgia, most notably Tyler Perry Studios in southwest Atlanta. The new studio, which is forecast to take about two years to construct, is expected to attract additional investment in the area and expand Atlanta's footprint in television and film, Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed has said. The project could mean "over 8,000 new jobs, including the relocation of 350 jobs," according a city press on Aug. 8, 2014, announcing tentative agreement between Perry and a government agency overseeing the post’s redevelopment. That 8.000 jobs forecast has been repeated frequently and across all media platforms and has sometimes been attributed to Reed. The mayor, however, has parsed his words more carefully, saying the project will create "hundreds" of jobs and has the potential to enhance the area culturally and economically. PolitiFact decided the projections warranted a closer look. We contacted Brian Hooker, executive director of the McPherson Implementing Local Redevelopment Authority. He told us the often-touted employment figure was formulated based on data from Perry’s organization. The Army, he said, wanted to assess how the proposed studio would affect vehicle traffic around the post, which closed in 2011. The job numbers, developed in July 2014, assume that between 10 and 20 productions will be in the works at the studio all times. Each production involves 200 to 300 skilled union and nonunion workers, as well as the talent (the on-screen folks and those you and I would consider the stars). Jobs at the studio could range from a low of 3,900 to a high of 8,300, according to the calculations. The vast majority -- 2,000 to 6,000 -- involve contract work related to the productions. A production usually takes an average of four to five months, Hooker said. The second biggest pool of workers -- between 500 to 1,500 -- will be temporary jobs building the studio. The actual number of full-time jobs is estimated at between 400 and 800, with the bulk of those -- 300 to 500 -- being members of the professional and executive staff overseeing daily operations at the studio, Hooker said. It’s not clear exactly how many of those executive staff employees will be true new hires. That’s because the permanent employees of the current Tyler Perry Studios, about 350, are expected to move to McPherson. (Tyler Perry Studios executives have not shared their plans for the existing studio facilities, Hooker said.) Between 100 to 300 workers, categorized as "operations labor," also will be full time. They will be responsible for assisting set designers and others who come to the studio as part of the various productions, Hooker said. Our conclusion: Tyler Perry plans to develop a major television and film studio at the former site of Fort McPherson, providing a major boost to the community and to Georgia’s growing film industry. The project has been forecast to create about 8,000 jobs, including some in construction. That’s based on a report, which we examined that shows a potential range of jobs from 3,900 to 8,300. At best only about 800 of those are expected to be permanent jobs. Most of them are in contract work. That’s important and missing context that doesn’t diminish the project but shortchanges the reader. The overall statement from the city is partially accurate, but misleading. We rate the statement Half True.	None	City of Atlanta	None	None	None	2015-05-01T00:00:00	2014-08-08	['None']
pomt-15343	"More businesses are closing than are opening for the first time in our nation's history."	half-true	/florida/statements/2015/jul/10/todd-wilcox/senate-candidate-wilcox-says-more-businesses-closi/	An Orlando businessman vying for Marco Rubio’s soon-to-be-vacated Senate seat announced his candidacy by saying fresh blood is needed to change the worst economic climate the country’s ever faced. "It's time to restore America's prominence both here at home and abroad," Todd Wilcox, a former Green Beret and CIA veteran, said in a statement announcing his candidacy on July 8, 2015. "The economy is growing at a dismal rate. More businesses are closing than are opening for the first time in our nation's history." The recent recession obviously has been an economic low point, but are the number of new businesses being eclipsed by the number of businesses closing for the first time ever? Well, it’s certainly true for as long as the government has been tracking that statistic. Beyond that is anyone’s guess. Wilcox, a Republican, told PolitiFact he was citing a May 2014 story from the Washington Post’s Wonkblog that said as much. The story was about a Brookings Institution study released that month called "Declining Business Dynamism in the United States: A Look at States and Metros," which examined business creation and destruction in the U.S. since 1978. The report said that business failures had held steady over most of that period, while business entries had steadily declined. Starting in 2008, the two points intersected for the first time in their 35-year history of the U.S. Census Bureau’s Business Dynamics Statistics data. The trend continued through 2011, the last year of available data in the study.The study’s authors said they couldn’t speak to the causes for this trend, which they called "noteworthy and disturbing." But they noted that "it is clear that these trends fit into a larger narrative of business consolidation occurring in the U.S. economy -- whatever the reason, older and larger businesses are doing better relative to younger and smaller ones." Where Wilcox’s claim falters is that the data isn’t for the entire 239-year history of the United States, but just the 35 years examined in the study. The Business Dynamics Statistics database only has figures from 1976 to 2012. What truly happened prior to that is largely anyone’s guess, economists told PolitiFact. "I am not aware of any standard measures before then. I suspect that other measures do exist, but I doubt that they are systematically measured, year in and year out," UCLA economics professor Lee Ohanian said. While it’s possible there have been other periods of history where a similar trend has occurred, such as during the Great Depression, there is no dependable source of data measuring it, they said. "It’s somewhere between plausible and impossible to prove," said Robert Litman, one of the authors of the Brookings study. He suggested it would be "more accurate to say that for the first time since the government began tracking these things, fails have exceeded starts." Our ruling Wilcox said, "More businesses are closing than are opening for the first time in our nation's history." He’s right that more firms are now closing up shop than starting up, a trend that started in 2008. But the stat he’s citing is from a study of a 35-year period from 1978 to 2011, not all of American history. The Census Bureau database used for that study has only been measuring entries and exits since the 1970s. Economists, including the study’s author, told us Wilcox overreached a bit, because this trend may have happened before. There are no dependable sources of information to prove this is the first time this has occurred. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-01443	Under sequestration, the military was cut "down to the smallest Army since 1940, the smallest Navy since 1915."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/05/lindsey-graham/lindsey-graham-army-smallest-1940-navy-smallest-19/	The United States has upped its operations in Iraq and Syria, but Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., says the military is shrinking. On CNN’s State of the Union Sunday morning, Graham criticized President Barack Obama for what he said are "half-measures" in thwarting terrorist group the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. While Obama has focused on avoiding sending in combat troops to the Middle East, Graham said up to 4,000 troops may be necessary. The issue of military size resurfaced when host Candy Crowley asked Graham what his plans are if Republicans take control of the Senate in November. He said replacing sequestration-style budgets is priority No. 1. "You just heard a segment about the spread of Ebola throughout Africa," he said. "We're cutting the CDC's budget, the NIH budget. We're taking the military budget under sequestration cuts down to the smallest Army since 1940, the smallest Navy since 1915. We're destroying the Intelligence Committee." There’s a lot in there, but the idea that the U.S. military -- by far the largest in the world in terms of spending -- is as small as it was nearly a century ago caught our attention. We found that Graham has accurate numbers regarding the Army and Navy. However, comparing today’s military to that of decades ago is comparing apples to oranges because of massive growth in technology and overall capabilities. The numbers Graham was referring to the number of ground forces and the number of ships, which is the traditional way of measuring the size of the Army and Navy, respectively, said Alex Roland, a professor of military history at Duke University. Graham’s staff pointed us to a letter written by former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta in 2011. Graham and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. -- both supporters of robust funding for the Defense Department -- requested the letter amid Congress’ budget talks in fall 2011 that led to sequestration legislation. In the letter, Panetta said, "Facing such large reductions, we would have to reduce the size of the military sharply. Rough estimates suggest after 10 years of these cuts, we would have the smallest ground force since 1940, the smallest number of ships since 1915, and the smallest Air Force in its history." As far as we can tell, Panetta’s assessment is accurate. The Army already is reducing the number of soldiers to 440,000-450,000 -- down from its recent war-time high of 570,000, according to the Defense Department’s 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review. (Those reductions are the result of the ending of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, not mandated budget cuts as part of the sequestration.) Going forward, if sequestration-style cuts go into effect for fiscal year 2016, the number of soldiers will likely have to drop to 420,000. This is the lowest number of soldiers since 1940. Before the draft went into effect later that year, there were about 264,000 troops in the Army. Turning to the Navy, there are currently 289 deployable battle force ships. According to the quadrennial review, there will be an estimated fleet of 234 ships in Fiscal Year 2019. That is the lowest number of ships since 1915 -- two years before the United States got involved in World War I. That year, the Navy had 231 deployable ships. In 2016, it jumped up to 245 ships. To summarize: Army 1940 2019 (est.) Number of troops 264,000 440,000 Navy 1915 2019 (est.) Number of ships 231 234 Still, Graham was trying to make the point that the budget cuts have weakened the military to points not seen in decades. However, we learned from experts that comparing the number of troops and ships doesn’t say much about military might. The context We took Graham’s claim to several experts, who told us that comparing the American military of 2014 to that of the early 20th century is irrelevant. Because of technological advances, the ships and troops of today’s military have greater capabilities than they did in the world wars. "One of the reasons for the decrease in size -- both Army and Navy -- is that we now rely far more on technology than on sheer numbers," said Roland, the military history expert from Duke. "The question is not how we compare to our Army in 1940 or our Navy in 1915, but how we compare with our potential enemies in 2014. We are head and shoulders above them." For example, the Navy did not have any aircraft carriers in 1915, but now it has an active fleet of 10. David E. Johnson, a political scientist at the Rand Corporation, estimated that just four modern aircraft carriers would have capabilities equal to that of the entire Navy before World War I. At that time, the military also did not have radar, satellites, computers, virtually undetectable ballistic missile submarines, drones and other advanced technology that allow the military to do more with fewer soldiers. Also, in terms of military spending relative to other countries, the United States accounts for 37 percent of the world’s total military spending. China follows, at 11 percent of the world’s spending, as of 2013, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. (Put another way, the United States spends as much on its military as the next 8-12 biggest defense-spending countries combined.) Warfare also has changed, Johnson said. It’s been decades since the United States has been involved in a war, like the world wars, where the country lost numerous ships and hundreds of thousands of soldiers. While the military should continue have a robust number of ships and soldiers, it does not necessarily need as many as it did in previous conflicts. That being said, Johnson said sequestration has hindered military capabilities -- particularly in light of recent developments in Iraq and Syria. The Pentagon has had to make cuts to its day-to-day operations, while carrying out missions in the Middle East that were not budgeted for. Our ruling Graham said that under sequestration, the military was cut "down to the smallest Army since 1940, the smallest Navy since 1915." Graham was counting the number of ground troops in the Army and the number of ships in the Navy. He’s got the numbers right, but it’s not a fair comparison because technology and capabilities have grown so much in the past century. The Army and Navy of today are much more capable than they were decades ago, even with fewer soldiers and ships. A better comparison is to look at how the U.S. military stands up relative to other nations. Graham’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details and takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-02300	"Since December 2010 Florida has created 540,000 new jobs."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/apr/02/rick-scott/rick-scott-touts-private-sector-job-growth/	Ask Gov. Rick Scott about practically any topic and he is bound to steer the conversation back to jobs. The former CEO of a health care company loves to cite statistics that relate to job growth, such as this one in a March 31 online ad: "Florida’s economy is on a better path. Since December 2010 Florida has created 540,000 new jobs. Let’s keep working." Scott, who has governed during the national recovery, is expected to face former Gov. Charlie Crist, who governed during the recession, in November. The jobs picture under both governors is a key topic of debate in the race. Did Scott correctly cite the number of new jobs in Florida? Private vs. public-sector jobs Scott started the clock ticking in December 2010, one month before the Republican took office. His campaign used data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to arrive at the figure. BLS data shows that the number of total nonfarm jobs grew by 517,500 between December 2010 and preliminary data for February 2014, the most recent month available. That’s a little short of the number Scott used. Scott gets to his number by ignoring reductions in government jobs. During the same time frame, Florida lost 23,200 government jobs. So if it hadn’t been for the lost government jobs, the number would be 540,000. At PolitiFact Florida we are very familiar with Scott’s statements about jobs and have been tracking his 2010 campaign promise to create over 700,000 jobs in seven years. That promise is currently rated In the Works. When Scott debuted his jobs promise in July 2010, state economists had released estimates showing that Florida would add 1.05 million jobs between July 1, 2010, and June 30, 2018 -- no matter who served as governor. In response, Scott clarified his promise and said that his 700,000 jobs would come in addition to the ones state economists forecasted. Put simpler: his 7-7-7 plan became 7-7-1.7 million. Scott’s press office has consistently disagreed with our analysis, saying Scott’s campaign materials never qualified that 700,000 jobs would be on top of normal growth projections. To achieve the goal of 700,000 jobs on top of normal growth requires the state to produce more than 20,000 jobs on average per month, every month, for seven years. He has fallen short of that average the majority of the months, though the jobs picture improved in 2013. In this particular online ad, Scott doesn’t use words to take credit for the job growth, but he is touting job growth during his watch. We have interviewed economists in the past who caution that a governor can’t take much credit for job growth during a national recovery -- or too much blame for job losses during a national recession. Kwame Donaldson, an economist at Moody’s who analyzes Florida, said that the creation of 540,000 private-sector jobs in the 38 months since December 2010 is not a particularly exceptional rate of job creation. "The most private-sector jobs created during any 38-month interval is 753,100 (during the 38-month interval that ended in August 2006)," Donaldson said in an email to PolitiFact Florida. "The current record is even less remarkable considering Florida’s larger current population." Our ruling Scott said in an online ad, "Since December 2010 Florida has created 540,000 new jobs." Looking only at the numbers -- and not whether Scott’s policies should get credit for the growth -- Florida added 517,500 total nonfarm jobs and lost 23,000 government-sector jobs between December 2010 and February 2014. It would have been more accurate for Scott to cite private-sector job growth. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2014-04-02T14:35:38	2014-03-31	['None']
pomt-10344	"McCain used to buck his party on immigration by fighting for comprehensive reform. . . . But when he was running for his party's nomination, he . . . said that he wouldn't even support his own legislation if it came up for a vote."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/16/barack-obama/backtracking-on-the-path-to-citizenship/	Seeking to portray his Republican rival as a flip-flopper on a critical issue for Latino voters, Sen. Barack Obama used a July 8, 2008, appearance before the League of United Latin American Citizens to note remarks Sen. John McCain made that appeared to disavow an immigration plan McCain had championed in Congress. "Now, I know Sen. McCain used to buck his party on immigration by fighting for comprehensive reform — and I admired him for it," Obama said. "But when he was running for his party's nomination, he abandoned his courageous stance, and said that he wouldn't even support his own legislation if it came up for a vote." Obama is referring to comments McCain made during a Jan. 30, 2008, Republican candidates' debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California. At issue was the immigration plan that McCain helped shepherd through the Senate in 2006 that combined border security and work-site enforcement to root out undocumented employees, with a guest worker program for most of the illegal immigrants in the country. House Republicans, who favored tough enforcement measures, branded the Senate measure as "amnesty" for illegal immigrants and the work of Democrats. They refused to participate in discussions to negotiate a compromise plan and instead passed a series of narrow bills aimed at thwarting illegal immigration. Most were never enacted into law, though Congress cleared a separate border fence bill. Asked during the debate whether he would vote for his original proposal if it came to the Senate floor again, McCain first demurred, saying it would not return in that form. But when pressed, he said he would not, because public opinion favored enforcement over citizenship measures. "I would not, because we know what the situation is today," McCain said. "The people want the border secured first. And so to say that that would come to the floor of the Senate — it won't. We went through various amendments which prevented that ever — that proposal." Asked again to confirm he would not vote for his bill as originally drafted, McCain replied, "My bill will not be voted on; it will not be voted on. I will sit and work with Democrats and Republicans and with all people. And we will have the principals securing the borders first." McCain's comments acknowledge many Republican primary voters' preference for tough enforcement measures. But in 2007, he supported another plan to rewrite immigration laws that resembled the previous year's effort and included a so-called "path to citizenship" for the estimated 12-million undocumented immigrants in the country. From these actions, one can infer McCain has toggled between endorsing enforcement measures and broader immigration plans that also address citizenship, depending on the circumstances. All of which backs up Obama's assertion. However, Obama is laying it on thick in stating McCain bucked his party in crafting the original plan. The immigration plans McCain championed were a priority of the Bush administration and Republican leaders in the Senate. To be sure, they infuriated grass-roots conservatives, who constitute a core GOP constituency and have long been critical of McCain's position on a host of issues. But in this case, Obama may be giving McCain too much credit for being a maverick in order to make the about-face more dramatic. Still, because McCain essentially disavowed his original comprehensive immigration proposal and said repeatedly he would focus on border security as president, we judge Obama's statement Mostly True.

pomt-08202	"Because of (U.S. Sen.-elect Ron) Johnson’s leadership, Senate Republicans adopted a caucus ban on earmarks."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/nov/22/republican-party-wisconsin/state-gop-says-earmarks-ban-passed-due-leadership-/	In the week following his decisive victory over three-term Democratic U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, political newcomer Ron Johnson laid low, declining interviews with state media. Turns out the Republican from Oshkosh was not inactive, though. National media reports on Nov. 9, 2010, placed Johnson among a group of incoming senators publicly backing a ban on earmarks -- those tasty pieces of pork sprinkled by the thousands into the federal budget by individual lawmakers. Reporters set up the issue as the first test of whether newly elected conservatives would take on a time-honored Washington tradition -- bringing home the bacon. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) and others opposed the ban, which is non-binding but symbolically significant. On Nov. 16, McConnell dropped his opposition, the caucus endorsed the ban and it passed. In a news release the next day, the Republican Party of Wisconsin lauded Johnson. "Because of Johnson’s leadership, Senate Republicans adopted a caucus ban on earmarks, showing the American people they’re serious about cutting government waste and corruption. Senator-elect Johnson isn’t wasting any time in his push for reforms, and the Republican Party of Wisconsin applauds his efforts." Wow. Did Johnson, not even in office yet, really lead the way on the earmarks ban? Let’s peek behind the headlines. The Senate Republican caucus includes 46 members. Johnson is one of 13 newly elected Republicans. He was one of six incoming freshman to publicly agree to sign on to the earmark ban at the request of U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina). Other newly elected senators hung back, and just four current senators initially joined DeMint’s group. The DeMint crew of 10, dubbed an "insurgent group" by The Washington Post, sent a letter to their colleagues urging support for a ban. McConnell and another defender of earmarks, Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Oklahoma), loudly pushed back against the ban in the days before the caucus vote. They said earmarks were a tiny slice of federal spending and important for district projects. Inhofe told the Post that banning earmarks "gives cover for big-spending members of Congress to look conservative. They start demagoguing the earmark thing and everybody goes, ‘Oh, they must be conservative.’" McConnell and Inhofe reportedly lobbied new members to vote against the earmark ban, although Johnson says he was not contacted. But the two backed off before the matter came to a vote, and on Nov. 16 in a closed-door meeting the caucus united behind a two-year moratorium. Again, media accounts portrayed sitting senators as bowing to pressure from voters and the Tea Party movement, to which Johnson is loosely tied. Johnson, by his own account, did not lobby other senators face-to-face on the issue. And he said he was not deeply involved with DeMint’s concerted effort, which dates back months. "That all occurred before we got here," said Johnson. "Quite honestly, we kind of stepped into this, having been asked to co-sponsor it (referring to the freshmen who signed on). And Sen. McConnell made his decision." DeMint, though, directly credits Johnson and the small group of early supporters for the victory. Wesley Denton, DeMint’s spokesman, told us: "Senator-elect Johnson was an early public supporter of the earmark ban. His leadership helped give us the momentum we needed to win." So, where does that leave us? In the wake of the earmarks vote, the state Republican Party credited Johnson’s leadership for its passage. The ban was opposed publicly by the Senate minority leader, putting the outcome of the vote in question. Johnson, new to Washington, joined a small group who took a public stand, while some other incoming freshmen stayed on the sidelines. Johnson didn’t take a role in arm-twisting on the issue. And he was not solely responsible, as the GOP’s claim suggests. But he and just a few others made a real difference in the outcome. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-03002	"Thirteen hundred" applicants in Rhode Island signed up for insurance through Obamacare.	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/oct/17/sheldon-whitehouse/sheldon-whitehouse-ted-cruz-spar-over-how-many-rho/	While Republicans and Democrats were still at loggerheads over the federal budget, the shutdown of the federal government and Obamacare, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, went on the Oct. 10 edition of CNN's "Crossfire" to debate all three. When the issue turned to Obamacare -- formally known as the Affordable Care Act -- , Whitehouse talked about how Rhode Islanders were receptive to the program, especially HealthSource RI, the state’s Obamacare health insurance exchange. He cited the case of one family that was so pleased, they returned to the HealthSource RI headquarters with coffee and doughnuts to thank the staff. At the time, many people were finding it impossible to sign up through exchanges run by other states and the federal government. That prompted this exchange: Cruz: "It's interesting that you apparently found a family in Rhode Island that went on the exchanges and got insurance." Whitehouse: "Thirteen hundred." Cruz: "It was publicly reported there were 580 in Rhode Island." We wondered who was correct, Cruz or Whitehouse. Whitehouse spokesman Seth Larson said the senator's 1,300 number came via a phone conversation with HealthSource RI. We emailed HealthSource RI and asked Dara Chadwick, chief of strategic communications and media relations, how many people had signed up by the end of the day on Oct. 10, when the two senators were giving their numbers. She responded that 786 applications had been processed as of Oct 5. That's well above Cruz's number but well below Whitehouse's. And it was for the wrong date. So we asked again. When we declined to identify the politician we were fact-checking, Chadwick gave us another non-responsive answer. At that point, we sought help getting the number from the offices of both Whitehouse and Gov. Lincoln Chafee Meanwhile, we took out our calculator. On Oct. 11, the day after Whitehouse's appearance, the director of HealthSource RI, Christine Ferguson, told The Providence Journal's medical writer, Felice Freyer, that 1,698 applicants had completed their paperwork and selected a health insurance plan. The two numbers we did have suggested that about 163 applicants were completing the process each day. That means, at the time of the "Crossfire" appearance, roughly 1,467 applicants should have been processed. A few hours later we heard back from Chadwick. She said that at the end of the day on Oct. 10, 1,479 applications had been completed and processed. When we told her we were checking the Whitehouse appearance, she said the number supplied by HealthSource RI had been the total through Oct. 9, which was 1,313, essentially the number the senator cited. Our ruling In a televised debate on the evening of Oct. 10, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said 1,300 applicants in Rhode Island had signed up for insurance through Obamacare; his debate opponent, Sen. Ted Cruz, cited a lower number for Rhode Island: 580. Cruz's statement was clearly False. Five days earlier, the number of processed applications had already hit 786, according to HealthSource RI. The number at the time "Crossfire" aired was 1,479. If Whitehouse had said his 1,300 number was a day old, we would give him True. But he was off by a day, so he gets a Mostly True.

pomt-13419	"In Harrisburg, I passed more bills than all the Democrats combined, in terms of legislation affecting the city."	true	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/sep/21/john-taylor/surprising-truth-about-philly-republicans-harrisbu/	State representative John Taylor is the rarest of Philadelphia’s elected officials: He’s a Republican. More than that, he’s a Republican liked by the unions, a Republican liked by Mayor Jim Kenney. Taylor told City & State PA last week he’s done something that makes him stand out even more among Philadelphia’s politicians: "In Harrisburg, I passed more bills than all the Democrats combined, in terms of legislation affecting the city." We’re talking about one representative versus 23 Democratic representatives. Could he really have passed more bills than all of them combined? First, we asked Taylor what time frame he was referring to. He said he meant this two-year term, from 2015 to present, given the article in which he was quoted focused on his bid for re-election against Democrat Joe Hohenstein. To test Taylor’s statement, we turned to the Legislature’s website, which tracks every bill sponsored by members of the state House and Senate. And it turns out Taylor is dead on. This term he’s been the primary sponsor of five bills that have passed into law, four of which have at least some relevance to Philadelphia. All 23 Philly Democrat representatives have been the primary sponsor of a combined two bills that have passed into law. The only two Democrats to sponsor bills that passed are Kevin Boyle and Bill Keller. Keller’s bill was about renaming portions of highways and streets in the area. Boyle’s had to do with emergency vehicles. Democrats Ed Neilson, Dwight Evans and Lynwood Savage haven’t even been a prime sponsor for a bill, period. "I don’t how far back that statistic would hold up," Taylor said of his passing more bills than the Democrats, "but it is certainly true for this term. And frankly it would be true for the next term." With that reference to the future, Taylor refers to the likelihood that Republicans will continue to hold power in the Senate and House. He said Republican leadership, which dominates the various committees, tends to emphasize their members ahead of the other party, meaning Republican-sponsored bills have a better chance of passing than Democrat-sponsored bills. "I was in the minority for 10 years," Taylor said. "You could come up with the cure for cancer and it would get put aside or it would come out with the Democratic name on it." Taylor said he attends most Philadelphia Delegation meetings and describes he and the Democrats from here as "kind of one big, happy family." And as one of three Republicans representing Philadelphia (Martina White is the other; Thomas Murt has a slice of Philly in addition to Montgomery County), he said he’s in the best position to act as a voice for the city. "For us to make things happen in a Republican-dominated body," Taylor said, "we need that." Our ruling In an article about Republican state Rep. John Taylor’s bid for re-election against Democrat Joe Hohenstein, Taylor emphasized the need for Philadelphia to have a prominent Republican by saying, "In Harrisburg, I passed more bills than all the Democrats combined, in terms of legislation affecting the city." According to the Legislature’s website, Taylor has been the prime sponsor of five bills that have passed this term. The 23 Philly Democrats have been prime sponsors of two bills that have passed.

pomt-13927	The ammunition used in the Orlando shooting "is banned by Geneva Convention. It enters the body, spins & explodes."	false	/punditfact/statements/2016/jun/23/michael-moore/liberal-filmmaker-michael-moore-says-ar-15-bullets/	Filmmaker and liberal commentator Michael Moore made a provocative claim about the ammunition used in the June 12 Orlando shooting — that it is prohibited by the Geneva Conventions. "Ammo used in AR-15/M-16 is banned by Geneva Convention," Moore tweeted June 14. "It enters the body, spins & explodes. Show the crime scene photos and the NRA is over." The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives reported June 12 that Omar Mateen had been in possession of a 9 millimeter semiautomatic pistol and a .223 caliber AR-type rifle. The latter was later identified as a Sig Sauer MCX rifle by the gun shop owner who sold Mateen the gun. Law enforcement has not released the exact type of .223-caliber ammunition used as of this fact-check’s publication. Still, many people responded on Twitter to Moore trying to debunk his tweet, so we took a closer look. We contacted Moore's office but didn't hear back. What is the Geneva Convention? The 1949 Geneva Conventions are a set of treaties and protocols dictating the humane treatment of people during war. For example, they prohibit torture, hostage-taking, deportation and execution without "judicial guarantees." In particular, the Conventions prescribe protections for various classes — the ill, medical workers, prisoners of war and civilians during wartime. The main text of the Geneva Convention treaties does not include any specific mention of prohibited ammunition, and neither do the supplementary protocols. The closest thing to Moore’s claim is Article 35 of the first protocol. It prohibits "weapons, projectiles and materials … causing superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering" but does not offer further clarification. In any case, the Geneva Convention does not apply to domestic weapon use, said Dan Joyner, a professor of law at the University of Alabama. Only wartime. "No source of international law prohibits the sale or use within a country of any particular kind of ammunition," Joyner said. Mateen’s declaration of allegiance to ISIS does give the incident an international character, but the Conventions primarily apply to issues between nation-factions. Different conventions We looked at other international conventions to see if they banned certain ammunition. Some do, but experts suggested Mateen’s ammunition might not qualify, again because these agreements are binding for traditional warfare, not domestic purchases. The first appearance of an ammunition ban in international treaties comes in the 1868 Declaration of St. Petersburg, which bans explosive or flammable projectiles weighing less than 400 grams. Declaration III of the 1899 Hague Convention bans bullets that "expand or flatten" upon entering the body — commonly known as "hollow-point bullets." The same language is included in the 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The catch? Hague only applies "in the case of war" between two or more signatories. Rome only creates jurisdiction over genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Case in point, the International Committee of the Red Cross notes that many parties to the Hague Convention use "expanding bullets" in their domestic police forces. Gary Mauser, professor emeritus at Simon Fraser University, said Moore’s claim errs in relating the Orlando shooting to the Convention. "That ban does not apply to the attacker in Orlando since he was not part of a formal military force," Mauser said. In its newly set International Small Arms Control Standards, the United Nations has recently included a ban on a narrowly defined type of armor-piercing ammunition. However, these protocols are only guidance for how countries could choose to behave domestically, Mauser said. "ISACS recommendations are merely recommendations, and do not have the force of law, either internationally or within any nation," said Mauser, who is also an ISACS expert advisor. The bullets Experts are unsure whether Mateen’s ammunition matches what the treaties describe anyway, as law enforcement officials have not yet released the exact type of bullet Mateen used. George Mocsary, a professor of law at Southern Illinois University, said that the vast majority of AR-15 bullets (mentioned in Moore’s tweet) are .223 "full metal jackets." These, Mocsary said, would not violate any conventions because they are "not expanding," "not explosive," and "not armour-piercing by the ISACS definition." Mocsary did, however, note that many .223 rounds can penetrate some armour simply by nature of being shot from a rifle. However, investigators have not confirmed whether "full metal jackets" were in fact what Mateen used. Tim O’Rourke, an investigator for The Grafton Group forensic science firm, said it is impossible to definitively characterize Mateen’s rounds without further information. It is possible and legal to purchase hollow-point "controlled expansion" rounds in Florida, he said. Regarding what Moore tweeted about the bullets’ "spin," O’Rourke noted it is possible for bullets to "tumble" in the body depending on contingent factors such as barrel length and distance fired. O’Rourke noted, however, that the bullets would not be designed to explode or detonate in the body. Nonetheless, doctors treating the injuries noted the severe damage done to victim’s bodies, such as "big, giant cavities" in the victims. One mentioned that bullets struck with such force that ripple effects damaged even nearby tissue. "It actually puts kinetic energy into tissue that it didn't hit," said doctor John M. Porter in the Philadelphia Inquirer. "It can go next to the liver and still destroy the liver." Our ruling Moore tweeted that the Geneva Convention prohibits the type of ammunition used in the Orlando shooting. However, the Geneva Convention does not deal with ammunition. Other international conventions do prohibit certain ammunition, but only during wartime, not domestically. Even if they were binding domestically, experts are not sure whether Mateen’s bullets qualify, given the limited information released from law enforcement. That being said, Moore’s tweet does emphasize the amount of damage these bullets inflicted. Even if his specifics might be off, doctors’ reports support Moore on the general point about damages. We rate Moore’s claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c7d1cc63-b740-4c9e-ae93-d00188ad5e6a	None	Michael Moore	None	None	None	2016-06-23T11:00:00	2016-06-14	['Orlando,_Florida']
pomt-08600	"We've created more than 850,000 jobs, more than all the other states combined."	true	/texas/statements/2010/sep/23/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-texas-has-created-more-850000-/	In a recent TV ad, Gov. Rick Perry boasts that Texas is "open for business." "We've created more than 850,000 jobs, more than all the other states combined," Perry says in the Sept. 12 spot. An Aug. 24 Houston Chronicle headline appears on the screen: "By any measure, Texas tops nation in job creation." The Perry campaign pointed us to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which tracks jobs in each state. In January 2001, shortly after Perry became governor, Texas had 9,542,400 nonfarm jobs. As of June: 10,395,800. That's a net gain of 853,400 jobs, a surge of 8.9 percent. From July 2000 to July 2009, the state grew by about 3.8 million people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Texas, the second-largest state, has created more jobs than any other state in Perry's time as governor. Arizona created the second-most jobs, 132,700, followed by Utah with 113,200. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have enjoyed a net job gain during Perry's tenure, while California, the most populous state, has lost the most jobs: 827,800. Michigan lost the second most, 755,900, followed by Ohio, at 557,300. Excluding Texas and including the District of Columbia, which had a net gain of 59,100 jobs, all the states combined had a net job loss of 3,185,000 from January 2001 to June 2010. Cheryl Abbot, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics in Dallas, confirmed that Perry is correct in saying that Texas added more jobs than all the other states combined. "Texas was one of the very few who even added jobs over that time," she said. That's not to say that Texas hasn't lost jobs. At its peak, Texas had about 10.64 million jobs in August 2008. About a year later, when the recession was in full swing, only 10.21 million jobs were on the payroll — about 430,000 less. Since, Texas has added about 180,000 jobs. That's about 250,000 fewer than its best. Worth noting: the Houston Chronicle article that the ad highlights looks at Texas job gains during that recent upswing, from July 2009 to July 2010 — just the past year of Perry's tenure as governor. We also wondered how many jobs were created in the state government — Perry's domain. According to the Texas Workforce Commission, Texas had 334,100 state government jobs in 2001, the year Perry took office, and 369,800 in 2009 — an increase of 35,700 jobs, or 10.7 percent, on Perry's watch. Significantly, Perry doesn't overtly take personal credit for the state leading the nation in jobs gained over his years as governor. We rate his statement as True. This story has been updated to correct the month that Perry became governor. He succeeded George W. Bush on December 21, 2000, not in January 2001.

pomt-09001	"Attorney General McCollum, Speaker-Designate Cannon, Senate President-Designate Haridopolos and I stood up to Governor Crist and worked to remove Jim Greer as Chairman because of his mismanagement of the party."	true	/florida/statements/2010/jul/13/john-thrasher/john-thrasher-takes-credit-pushing-jim-greer-rpof/	October 18, 2010, is the day disgraced former Republican Party of Florida Chairman Jim Greer will stand trial on charges that he funneled funds from the RPOF into his own private ventures. As that trial nears, and the August statewide primary elections loom, there’s been plenty of political posturing around his case -- with party leaders trying to distance themselves from Greer or showcase themselves as the ones who pushed for his ouster. On July 1, 2010, after Greer’s trial date was set, Rick Scott, who is running against Attorney General Bill McCollum to be the Republican candidate for governor, called for an independent investigation into Greer’s mismanagement, arguing there was a conflict of interest with having the Attorney General’s office handle the investigation. "His back-room-deal mentality is out of step with voters who are demanding accountability and openness," Scott said about McCollum in a press statement. Scott’s statement prompted the current RPOF chairman John Thrasher, a state senator from St. Augustine, to fire back with this response: "Attorney General McCollum, Speaker-Designate Cannon, Senate President-Designate Haridopolos and I stood up to Governor Crist and worked to remove Jim Greer as Chairman because of his mismanagement of the party." We decided to look further into Thrasher’s claim. Is it true that these four men "worked to remove Jim Greer?" When we turned to the Republican Party of Florida, which distributed Thrasher’s statement in a press release, they referred us to various news articles detailing Gov. Charlie Crist’s support and close ties to Greer, his hand-picked choice for chairman after Crist’s own election in 2006. Greer was an Oviedo city council member and regional leader of Crist's campaign. Tying Greer to Crist, though, doesn’t address which party leaders had pushed for Greer’s ouster. So we decided to look back and see where and when there were reports that the four high-profile Republicans pushed for his ouster. But first a little background on what led to Greer’s removal. Greer was forced out early in 2010, after complaints arose of lavish spending on party-issued credit cards and Republican donors and the media started to call for the release of the credit card statements. Nearly $7.3 million is reported to have been spent for the three years that Greer served as party chairman from 2006 to 2009. When Thrasher took over as party chairman in February, he ordered an audit of RPOF finances. A subsequent investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement showed Greer and Delmar Johnson, an RPOF staffer, had formed a consulting company, Victory Strategies, that was paid a 10-percent commission on money raised for the party. According to FDLE’s arrest affidavit, Victory Strategies funneled $125,000 from the party. Johnson kept $65,000 with the rest going to Greer. Now back to the question at hand: Did Thrasher, McCollum, Cannon and Haridopolos work to remove Jim Greer? Under growing pressure from party leaders, and with a state investigation by the FDLE pending, Greer voluntarily stepped down from his post on Jan. 5, 2010. We looked at media reports before and after Greer left, to see if and when the four Republicans mentioned by Thrasher started to publicly complain about Greer’s practices. Aug. 23, 2009 -- Haridopolos voluntarily gives back his party-issued credit card after initial reports of high spending by some cardholders, according to an Orlando Sentinel report. Dec. 18, 2009 -- Fifty party leaders call for Greer’s resignation. The same day, Greer tells the St. Petersburg Times that Crist "has told me I'm not to consider resigning." Dec. 26, 2009 -- Hillsborough County Republican Chairwoman Deborah Cox-Roush, in a long letter to the state executive committee, notes that Cannon and Haridopolos "refused to comment publicly" about Greer’s future, a signal he had lost their support. Dec. 29, 2009 -- The St. Petersburg Times called it "the biggest shoe to drop yet" when a dozen major GOP fundraisers called on Greer to resign. Jan. 5, 2010 -- Greer steps down in a hastily organized teleconference. That same day Cannon transfers $550,000 from the party’s account into his political action committee, the Florida Liberty Fund. A political strategist hired by Cannon tells the Orlando Sentinel that Cannon had requested the transfer earlier, citing lost faith in how Greer was spending the money. Jan. 7, 2010 -- Just before the party meets to select a new chairman, Senate President Jeff Atwater, R-North Palm Beach, adds Thrasher as a member of party executive committee. Feb. 11, 2010 -- As reports detailing party finances come out, McCollum issues a campaign press release stating his "outrage over recent revelations of extravagant contracts and lavish spending." He adds: "If audit findings suggest potential criminal activity, I will assist the state Executive Committee in directing these findings to the appropriate law enforcement investigatory agency." The Orlando Sentinel describes McCollum as "a driving force" in ousting Greer. Feb. 20, 2010 -- With Thrasher now elected as RPOF chairman, he tells members gathered for a general meeting that his "first order of business" is to call for a internal audit of the state party’s finances, according to a St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald story. State Sen. Paula Dockey, R-Lakeland, a McCollum rival for governor at the time, criticizes McCollum for being slow in responding to the Greer issue. A St. Petersburg Times blog also says McCollum, "like other Republican legislative leaders, long brushed off criticism of Greer's management and pleas that he help oust Greer." April 1, 2010 -- Greer files a lawsuit against the state party and Thrasher as party chairman, claiming they reneged on a secret severance package that would have paid Greer about one-year’s salary, nearly $124,000. The lawsuit also claims that Cannon and Haridopolos allegedly offered to pay Greer $200,000 in "hush money," to remain quiet about the severance agreement. Thrasher, Cannon and Haridopolos’ signatures appear on the secret deal, although not all on the same page, indicating their active involvement in the negotiations. The party, in response, says the severance agreement is not an enforceable contract, according to the St. Petersburg Times. June 2, 2010 -- The Florida Department of Law Enforcement announces they have opened an investigation into Greer’s spending practices. And that’s the tale of Greer’s fall. Thrasher has put much of the blame on Crist, for putting Greer in power and not curtailing his spending. Crist, who initially stood by Greer saying he was doing a "good job," has since said he was "surprised and disappointed" by Greer’s actions. Still Thrasher continues to pounce on Crist and the close relationship he shared with Greer. "The governor's the guy that pretty much placed Chairman Greer in the position he did," Thrasher said in an April 22, 2010, interview with the Tallahassee press corps. Much of the pressure and negotiation to remove Greer took place internally, and the "four horsemen," as Greer called them in his lawsuit, are not laying out their individual machinations. But it’s apparent these four party leaders were the ones who had to act after fundraisers and county chairmen rebelled against Greer. Attorney General McCollum, Speaker-Designate Cannon and Senate President-Designate Haridopolos were top elected party leaders. Thrasher became a key player by virtue of his quick selection to replace Greer. Regardless of the behind-the-scenes nature of their attempts, the four politicians have been the most visible in their attempts to get Greer out of office. And they acted in the face of initial support for Greer from Gov. Crist, who at the time was still the nominal head of the party. We rate Thrasher’s statement True.

pomt-11013	Indiana expanded Medicaid when Mike Pence was governor	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2018/jul/09/mandy-cohen/nc-democrat-right-about-mike-pence-expanding-medic/	Democrats in North Carolina argue the state should expand Medicaid to help residents pay for health care. Such a move would help hundreds of thousands of uninsured residents, they say, adding that most of the cost would be paid by the federal government. The Affordable Care Act enabled states to cover more people under Medicaid. But the legislation, signed into law by Democratic President Barack Obama, remains deeply unpopular among Republicans, and some state governments — including North Carolina’s — are refusing to expand Medicaid coverage. In North Carolina, a bill to expand Medicaid through a program called "Carolina Cares" was authored by Republicans but doesn’t have enough support to pass in the GOP-controlled legislature. So on June 26, a member of Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper’s cabinet urged Republican legislators to follow in the footsteps of another prominent conservative: Vice President Mike Pence. Mandy Cohen, secretary of the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services, told the crowd at a "Close the Gap Advocacy Day" event that Pence approved Medicaid expansion while governor of Indiana. "When (the Vice President) was Governor of Indiana, he expanded Medicaid," Cohen said, according to this tweet by the executive director of NC AIDS Action. Cohen’s comments came in the waning days of the N.C. General Assembly session, when legislators could have taken up the Medicaid expansion bill but didn’t. When PolitiFact contacted Cohen’s office, spokesman Cobey Culton referenced the websitefor Indiana’s health care program to support her claim. A deal with Obama The ACA, also known as Obamacare, allowed states to expand Medicaid programs to adults earning 138 percent of the federal poverty level, which in 2015 was about $2,743 a month for a family of four. And it encouraged states to expand coverage by offering to pay for a large majority of the cost. Under standard Medicaid, the federal government offers states a cost-match ranging from 50 to 73 percent. Under the ACA, the federal government paid 100 percent of Medicaid expansion costs between 2014 and 2016. It then dropped its support to 95 percent in 2017 and plans to cut its support to 90 percent by 2020. In 2015, then-Indiana Gov. Pence reached an agreement with the Obama administration to expand Medicaid under a custom program known as the "new Healthy Indiana Plan." The words "Medicaid" and "expansion" rarely appear together on Indiana’s health care website. The state describes the program as a "homegrown consumer-driven health care coverage program for low-income adults." And, upon announcing the news, Pence avoided praising Medicaid as an effective coverage option. "I believe Medicaid is not a program we should expand. It's a program that we should reform — and that's exactly what we're accomplishing," Pence said during a speech at an Indiana hospital. "HIP 2.0 is not intended to be a long-term entitlement program. It's intended to be a safety net that aligns incentives with human aspirations." But expand Medicaid, Indiana did. And, by the time Trump and Pence were elected to the White House, Pence was one of 10 Republican governors to expand Medicaid. "Indiana and Arkansas have different names for their programs, but they are accessing federal funds through the ACA Medicaid expansion legislation," said Robin Rudowitz, associate director for the program on Medicaid for the Kaiser Family Foundation. KFF is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that focuses on health care issues. As a result, about 381,000 people were enrolled in Indiana’s program by 2016, according to the State Health Reform Assistance Network. Indiana’s program Some conservatives oppose the idea of expanding Medicaid mainly because they fear the government might shift more of the financial burden to state governments over time. (Despite expanding Medicaid in Indiana, Pence wants to repeal the ACA and has falselyclaimed that expansion made it harder for disabled Ohioans to obtain coverage.) Indiana’s expansion plan gained support from Republicans in part because the Hoosier state implemented controversial qualification requirements. For example, all participants in Indiana’s program must contribute money — from $1 to $27 per month — to a health savings account. Enrollees who miss payments face a reduction in benefits. "In Indiana’s case their waiver contained elements like some increased cost sharing and health savings accounts — other states that have expanded Medicaid have used some of these ideas too," said Adam Searing, an associate professor at Georgetown University’s school of public policy. At the time, Indiana was the 28th state to expand Medicaid and one of the first to require premium payments. Since then, that list of states has grown to 33, and Utah is putting the issue to a vote via a statewide referendum this November. "While Indiana’s expansion doesn’t look exactly like say California’s or New York’s where they just expanded coverage under their existing Medicaid program to the new group of adults, it does look a lot like Arkansas or Kentucky or Arizona or Montana which all used such waivers when they expanded Medicaid," Searing wrote in an email. Effect of conditions The latest Medicaid expansion proposal in North Carolina (Carolina Cares) is modeled after Indiana's program. It would charge premiums and impose work requirements. Critics worried that Indiana’s rules would hinder its ability to cover more people. A recent study found that insurance coverage increased in states that expanded Medicaid — including Indiana. Aaron E. Carroll, a professor of pediatrics at Indiana University’s School of Medicine and a critic of Indiana’s payment requirements, summarized the findings in a July 2 article for The New York Times. "The good news is that even with these extra requirements, Indiana saw significant gains in Medicaid coverage," Carroll wrote. "But we don’t know if gains would have been even larger without them," he continued. "It’s possible that the churn caused by cost-sharing requirements may be causing the state to underperform. Neighboring states did see larger gains than Indiana itself. But Indiana overperformed compared with other, more distant states, making this unclear." Our ruling Cohen said Indiana expanded Medicaid while Pence was governor. Though Indiana doesn’t refer to its program as Medicaid expansion, the state did expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act while implementing controversial conditions.

pomt-02177	Says Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald "Sterling is a Democrat."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/28/drudge-report/drudge-says-clippers-owner-democrat/	When Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling was outed for allegedly making racist comments, conservatives leapt to dig deeper and came up with a surprising find. Sterling is a Democrat. Or so they claimed. Matt Drudge tweeted to more than 264,000 followers: "NYT informed the unwashed how Bundy is a Republican. Leaves out NBA Sterling is a Democrat." A recording of Sterling telling his girlfriend not to bring African-American friends to basketball games came on the heels of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy suggesting blacks would do better as slaves. Hence, Drudge’s tweet comparing the two men. PunditFact adds its research to the work of several other news organizations to correct the record on Sterling. (Hat tips below.) He is a registered Republican, according to the Los Angeles County voter registry. As far as we can tell, the conservative website Daily Caller was the first to tie Sterling to the Democratic Party. It had an click-baiting item on Saturday that declared, "Race hate spewing Clippers owner is Democratic donor." That article listed Sterling’s campaign contributions from more than 20 years ago. He spread a total of $4,000 among three Democrats, including former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, and California Gov. Gray Davis. According to public records, he has given no money to any candidate since. Shortly after midnight, the National Review Online posted that Sterling was a Democrat and then sometime later corrected itself. "An earlier version of this post identified Sterling as a Democrat," the editor wrote. "Although his political donations appear to have been exclusively to Democrats, his official party affiliation is not known." At about noon on Sunday, Drudge made his claim. In the wee hours, as Sunday became Monday, Los Angeles Times columnist Michael Hiltzik rebutted those statements. Hiltzik tweeted, "What makes anyone think Donald Sterling is a Democrat? LA County records show him registered Republican since 1998." Mother Jones, Talking Points Memo and the Washington Post quickly made the same point during the day on Monday. Our ruling Drudge said Sterling is a Democrat. County records show that he is a registered Republican and has been for many years. His donations to Democrats took place two decades ago and were modest even by the standards of that time. We rate the claim Pants on Fire. Update: As we were publishing our fact-check, Drudge deleted his tweet without explanation.

pomt-05033	"For his first interview as president, Barack Obama chose Arab TV for an apology."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/12/secure-america-now/ad-says-obama-apologized-showed-weakness-iran/	A new ad from an independent group claims President Barack Obama apologized and showed weakness on Iran. The ad comes from Secure America Now, which calls itself a "broad-based grassroots coalition of 2 million national security activists." A reader in Florida asked us to check it out. It uses clips from an interview Obama gave in the White House during his first days in office with the Arab network Al Arabiya. A female voiceover says, "For his first interview as president, Barack Obama chose Arab TV for an apology." (The words "an apology" flash across the screen.) Then it cuts to Obama telling the interviewer, "Start by listening, because all too often the United States starts by dictating." The voiceover says, "He reached out." Obama: "It is important for us to be willing to talk to Iran." Voiceover: "Iran answered with terror, attacks on our troops and nuclear weapons development. …Tell President Obama: no apologies, no weakness. It’s time to stop Iran." The claim that Obama has apologized for America has been used and reused countless times -- always falsely -- and we found that this incarnation is only a hair closer to the truth. His first interview Obama sat down with Hisham Melhem, Al Arabiya’s Washington bureau chief, on Jan. 27, 2009. The network, based in Dubai, is regarded as a less-radical format than Al Jazeera and has been criticized for having a pro-Saudi Arabia bias. News coverage at the time billed the interview as Obama’s "first television interview in the White House," according to the New York Times, and "his first formal television interview as president," per the Washington Post. A spokesman for Secure America Now also pointed us to an MSNBC story characterizing the interview as the new president’s first. The Al Arabiya interview was part of a coordinated unveiling of Obama’s diplomatic initiatives. He had just named former Maine Sen. George Mitchell as special envoy to the Middle East, and before he sent Mitchell off on a tour of the region, he called Arab and Israeli leaders on his first full day in office. So it’s fair to say this was Obama’s first interview as president. No apology The interview begins with Melhem asking Obama about Mitchell's appointment and how the administration plans to pursue peacemaking between Israelis and Palestinians. Obama responds: Well, I think the most important thing is for the United States to get engaged right away. And George Mitchell is somebody of enormous stature. He is one of the few people who have international experience brokering peace deals. And so what I told him is start by listening, because all too often the United States starts by dictating -- in the past on some of these issues --and we don't always know all the factors that are involved. So let's listen. He's going to be speaking to all the major parties involved. And he will then report back to me. From there we will formulate a specific response. Ultimately, we cannot tell either the Israelis or the Palestinians what's best for them. They're going to have to make some decisions. But I do believe that the moment is ripe for both sides to realize that the path that they are on is one that is not going to result in prosperity and security for their people. And that instead, it's time to return to the negotiating table. And it's going to be difficult, it's going to take time. I don't want to prejudge many of these issues, and I want to make sure that expectations are not raised so that we think that this is going to be resolved in a few months. But if we start the steady progress on these issues, I'm absolutely confident that the United States -- working in tandem with the European Union, with Russia, with all the Arab states in the region -- I'm absolutely certain that we can make significant progress. The ad uses only his comments, "Start by listening, because all too often the United States starts by dictating." But Obama was discussing how to begin brokering a peace deal between Israelis and Palestinians. He was not referring to Iran, as the ad implies. In addition, we don’t agree that those words equate to an apology. In that statement, and a few others, Obama seemed to be acknowledging that past efforts in the Middle East have been imperfect. Later, speaking about the wider Arab world, Obama said, "My job to the Muslim world is to communicate that the Americans are not your enemy. We sometimes make mistakes. We have not been perfect. But if you look at the track record, as you say, America was not born as a colonial power, and that the same respect and partnership that America had with the Muslim world as recently as 20 or 30 years ago, there's no reason why we can't restore that." Nowhere in the interview did Obama use the word "apology," "apologize" or "sorry." PolitiFact has examined the apology claim numerous times. Mitt Romney, the likely Republican presidential nominee, wrote in his book and repeated many times that Obama has apologized for America around the world. But again, there isn’t an "I’m sorry" anywhere to be found in Obama’s speeches or remarks. One expert we’ve talked to before says Obama is using conciliatory language for diplomatic purposes, not apologizing. "It's much more a sense of establishing of reciprocity," John Murphy, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, told PolitiFact in 2010. "Each side says, okay, we haven't done great, but we have a new president and we're going to make a fresh start and move forward. I don't think that's an apology." Our ruling Secure America Now’s ad says, "For his first interview as president, Barack Obama chose Arab TV for an apology." The ad particularly emphasizes that Obama apologized. Obama’s first television interview after taking office was with the Al Arabiya network at the White House. But the ad gets nothing right beyond that. By saying "all too often the United States starts by dictating," Obama was not apologizing but being diplomatic about past strategies that failed to yield results. What’s more, the ad criticizes Obama’s approach to Iran, but his quote actually referred to the Israelis and the Palestinians. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts and gives an inaccurate impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-05935	"This president went before the United Nations and castigated Israel for building settlements. He said nothing about thousands of rockets being rained in on Israel from the Gaza Strip."	false	/florida/statements/2012/jan/27/mitt-romney/romney-says-obama-castigated-israel-building-settl/	The Republican presidential candidates want to cast themselves as best buds with Israel and President Barack Obama as the pal of the Palestinians. At a Jan. 26, 2012, debate in Jacksonville, a listener who described himself as a Palestinian-American Republican asked this question: "How would a Republican administration help bring peace to Palestine and Israel when most candidates barely recognize the existence of Palestine or its people?" Romney’s reply included a comment about Hamas and its intent to eliminate Israel while he reiterated his own support for Israel. Then he turned the discussion toward a critique of Obama: "This president went before the United Nations and castigated Israel for building settlements. He said nothing about thousands of rockets being rained in on Israel from the Gaza Strip." We emailed Romney’s campaign to ask which Obama speech or speeches he was referring to and did not get a reply, so we will look at a few of Obama’s speeches to the U.N. that included comments about Israel: Sept. 23 2009: It's true that Obama does not specifically mention Hamas. But it's certainly not a one-sided chastisement of Israel. Obama repeatedly calls on Palestinians to understand and respect Israel's security needs and mentions the fear Israelis face about rocket attacks. And Obama notes efforts on both sides. "Palestinians have strengthened their efforts on security. Israelis have facilitated greater freedom of movement for the Palestinians," Obama said. "As a result of these efforts on both sides, the economy in the West Bank has begun to grow. But more progress is needed. We continue to call on Palestinians to end incitement against Israel, and we continue to emphasize that America does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements" Obama describes how the U.S. and the U.N. should respond: "The United States does Israel no favors when we fail to couple an unwavering commitment to its security with an insistence that Israel respect the legitimate claims and rights of the Palestinians. And nations within this body do the Palestinians no favors when they choose vitriolic attacks against Israel over constructive willingness to recognize Israel's legitimacy and its right to exist in peace and security." Obama also talked about the pain both Israelis and Palestinians face: "We must remember that the greatest price of this conflict is not paid by us. It's not paid by politicians," Obama said. "It's paid by the Israeli girl in Sderot who closes her eyes in fear that a rocket will take her life in the middle of the night. It's paid for by the Palestinian boy in Gaza who has no clean water and no country to call his own." Sept. 23 2010: Obama laid out goals for both sides, including that the Palestinians must have opportunities, and that the Palestinians will only win rights through peaceful means and reconciliation with Israel. As for the settlements, Obama said: "Israel's settlement moratorium has made a difference on the ground and improved the atmosphere for talks. And our position on this issue is well known. We believe that the moratorium should be extended." It was another even-handed speech in which Obama made his support for Israel evident. Although Obama didn’t mention Hamas specifically, he did criticize those who murder Israelis or fire rockets at them: "It should be clear to all that efforts to chip away at Israel's legitimacy will only be met by the unshakeable opposition of the United States. And efforts to threaten or kill Israelis will do nothing to help the Palestinian people. The slaughter of innocent Israelis is not resistance -- it's injustice. And make no mistake: The courage of a man like President (Mahmoud) Abbas, who stands up for his people in front of the world under very difficult circumstances, is far greater than those who fire rockets at innocent women and children. …. This time, we will think not of ourselves, but of the young girl in Gaza who wants to have no ceiling on her dreams, or the young boy in Sderot who wants to sleep without the nightmare of rocket fire." Sept. 11, 2011: On the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, Obama said that the two sides were at a stalemate after he had called for a Palestinian state a year before. Obama spoke about the desires of Palestinians and Israelis, saying they both have legitimate aspirations. He devoted one paragraph here to the Palestinians talking about a future in which they can live in a state "with no limit to what they can achieve." And then Obama had three paragraphs focused on Israel’s side: "But understand this, as well: America's commitment to Israel's security is unshakeable. Our friendship with Israel is deep and enduring. And so we believe that any lasting peace must acknowledge the very real security concerns that Israel faces every single day. "Let us be honest with ourselves. Israel is surrounded by neighbors that have waged repeated wars against it. Israel's citizens have been killed by rockets fired at their houses and suicide bombs on their buses. Israel's children come of age knowing that, throughout the region, other children are taught to hate them. Israel, a small country of less than 8 million people, look out at a world where leaders of much larger nations threaten to wipe it off the map. "The Jewish people carry the burden of centuries of exile and persecution and fresh memories of knowing that 6 million people were killed simply because of who they are. Those are facts; they cannot be denied." He didn’t mention Israeli settlements or Hamas specifically, although he did talk about rockets being fired at Israelis. Out of the three speeches we examined, in this one Obama devoted more words to the Israeli side but still spoke of hopes for both sides. Our ruling In Florida, a state with a significant Jewish voting population, Romney said: "This president went before the United Nations and castigated Israel for building settlements. He said nothing about thousands of rockets being rained in on Israel from the Gaza Strip." But that doesn’t square with our review of Obama’s speeches. In his 2009 speech to the U.N., Obama said that America does not accept "the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements." Though he did not specifically mention Hamas, he did mention Israeli’s fear of rockets. And in later speeches to the U.N., Obama was blunt in his criticism of violent attacks against Israelis, once saying "the slaughter of innocent Israelis is not resistance -- it's injustice." Our examination of three of Obama’s speeches to the U.N. showed that Obama is fairly even-handed as he has laid out goals for both sides -- while he spoke against the Israeli settlements, he also bluntly opposed violent attacks on Israelis. We rate this claim False.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-01-27T17:23:49	2012-01-26	['Israel', 'United_Nations', 'Gaza_Strip']
pomt-09263	Says Texas has been waiting for two years for the federal government to act on a proposal to allow the state to "create insurance opportunities for those that are uninsured today."	false	/texas/statements/2010/may/01/rick-perry/perry-says-state-waiting-feds-act-health-care-prop/	Gov. Rick Perry, a critic of the new federal health care law, said in an April 15 interview with the Texas Tribune and Newsweek magazine that states could act on their own to reduce the number of residents who lack health insurance. How so? Texas has “had for over two years, waiver requests in front of the Health and Human Services committee — before this administration (of Democratic President Barack Obama) got into place, I might add — that allowed us some flexibility ... to use dollars differently than what are mandated by the federal government to create insurance opportunities for those that are uninsured today,” Perry said. Perry's point: Texas has proposed some good ideas to help its uninsured residents with health care, but the feds have chosen to sit on them. Really? We sought to learn more. In response to our inquiry, the governor’s re-election campaign provided us with a copy of a 65-page proposal to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services dated April 18, 2008 -- nearly two years to the day before Perry’s Tribune interview. Clarification: According to the campaign, only one waiver request was sent, not "requests" as Perry put it. The Texas proposal states that it “outlines a comprehensive package of health care reforms that will provide more people with insurance, reduce reliance on expensive emergency room visits for basic care, and make it easier for the working poor to buy into employer-sponsored health coverage.” The state would do this, according to the proposal, by creating the Texas Health Opportunity Pool, a fund that would, among other things, provide subsidies to help low-income Texans pay for employer-sponsored insurance or buy into private plans the state would help set up. State officials estimated that by its fifth year, the program would have nearly 700,000 participants and would have cost $30 billion in federal, state and local funds. To generate money for the pool, the state sought permission from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to use federal Medicaid dollars that would normally go to hospitals that serve many uninsured and poor patients. (The federal agency can give states some flexibility in how they operate their Medicaid programs.) Medicaid, established in 1965, uses federal and state funding to provide health insurance to extremely low-income Americans. Perry had previously touted the plan in his 2007 State of the State address, saying that it "recognizes the long-term benefits of providing Texans preventative care through insurance instead of paying for costly emergency room visits." At the time, more than 5 million Texans lacked health insurance. However, Perry's vision for a revamped health care system in Texas -- the state that has had the highest proportion of uninsured residents for years -- hasn't gotten very far since it was sent to Washington in April 2008, George W. Bush's last year as president. In August 2008, Dianne Heffron, an official with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is part of the federal health agency, sent a letter to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission stating that CMS was "willing to work with Texas as part of a formal (waiver) process" but that "a number of areas under this proposal have been identified as problematic" -- making it impossible for the agency to approve the proposal as written. Some cited issues: + A delay -- two years -- before insurance subsidies to parents and adults without children would take effect. + A $25,000 cap on insurance benefits for parents, which the agency indicated was too low. + Extending health coverage to children of legal immigrants who have lived in the country for less than five years; a 1996 rewrite of federal welfare law bars immigrants who have been in the country less than five years from receiving public benefits. After receiving the letter, according to Stephanie Goodman, spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, the state went back and forth with federal officials as it unsuccessfully tried to get the waiver approved before Bush left office. On July 31, 2009, Perry wrote to the Obama administration's secretary of health and human services, Kathleen Sebelius, asking her to approve the request as previously submitted by the state. His letter states that the "negotiation process was under way when the Obama administration took office in January, but is now stalled in Washington." Sebelius replied Oct. 27, writing that federal officials still had concerns about the proposal, including "the proposed funding sources and the extent to which access to health care coverage would be meaningfully expanded." She said she had directed appropriate officials to meet with the state to "help determine next steps and further assist Texas in developing an approvable health reform proposal." On Nov. 1, the state sent Sebelius a two-page document outlining the "principles, values and outcomes contained in the Texas waiver" to "re-familiarize" the feds with the proposal in hopes of extending discussions. When CMS asked for more information, Goodman told us, the state held back, waiting for the outcome of congressional debate over health care. By then, the prospect of national health reform appeared likely to complicate the Texas waiver request. In fact, the new law extended Medicaid coverage to some of the same people Texas had targeted to receive insurance subsidies. "We don’t believe the current (federal) reform plan invalidates our waiver request, but the implementation of the federal reforms would significantly change the landscape so we’d probably have to make some adjustments in our state proposal," Goodman said. Nevertheless, Goodman said, the state has continued to push for the "primary components" of the proposal, including redirecting billions in Medicaid hospital funds to the Health Opportunity Pool, but has received no recent response from CMS officials about that. When we contacted CMS, spokeswoman Mary Kahn said the agency was waiting for Texas to revise and resubmit its proposal. "They haven't sent us anything that meets the full requirements of being a formal waiver request," Kahn said. "In other words, the ball is in the state's court." So, where does all this leave Perry's statement? The governor is correct that the state sought federal permission about two years ago to redirect Medicaid hospital funds into a state pool intended to help some low-income Texans get private insurance. Since then, state and federal officials have gone back and forth on the request, with no resolution. Perry portrays the request as still awaiting action by the feds. But the federal agency has told state officials that their proposal needs revision before it can be formally considered. In that sense, federal officials have acted, and the state is responsible for the latest delay that Perry decries. We rate Perry's statement as False.

pomt-05252	"The legislature was never given the opportunity to debate or vote on loaning $75 million to 38 Studios."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jun/01/dennis-algiere/ri-sen-algiere-says-legislators-never-got-chance-d/	As fallout from the 38 Studios affair continues to rain down on Rhode Island, the finger pointing and questions of who knew what when are springing up like dandelions. In a May 23 letter to the editor in The Westerly Sun, Harriet Lloyd, executive director of the Rhode Island Statewide Coalition, said it was "disingenuous" for South County legislators Sen. Dennis Algiere and Rep. Donna Walsh to voice dismay over the $75-million loan guarantee that went to Curt Schilling’s company since they voted for the approving legislation in 2010. "The source of the 38 Studios disaster lies in 2010 legislation they ... supported that enabled the EDC to spend taxpayer monies of monumental proportions without approval of voters," she wrote. Her remark provoked a rebuttal letter the following day from Algiere, Walsh and three other Westerly and Charlestown lawmakers -- Representatives Samuel A. Azzinaro and Brian P. Kennedy, and Sen. Francis T. Maher. Together the Democrat and Republican lawmakers wrote: "The legislature was never given the opportunity to debate or vote on loaning $75 million to 38 Studios." In light of some of the vitriolic reactions to the company’s now precarious existence, we thought it timely to look at the accuracy of the legislators’ statement. Here are the facts: As The Providence Journal chronicled in a Nov. 7, 2010, story, the 38 Studios deal was cloaked in secrecy from the start. In March of that year, then-Gov. Donald Carcieri attended a fundraiser for a World War II documentary at Schilling’s home in Medfield, Mass. Besides the documentary, the two talked business. Carcieri suggested the former Red Sox pitcher bring his new start-up video game company to Providence. During the next several weeks, Schilling and his team met privately with Carcieri’s top aides; Keith Stokes, the newly appointed executive director of the Economic Development Corporation; and House Speaker Gordon D. Fox. Schilling was interested in what funding the EDC could offer him. What emerged from those discussions was an arrangement that would bring the expanding company and the promise of 450 jobs to Rhode Island in return for the state guaranteeing $75 million in loans to the company. During the 2010 legislative session, with banks still not lending money in the aftermath of the housing collapse, Smith Hill lawmakers were already receptive to an EDC proposal for a $50-million revolving loan guarantee fund for small businesses. But what House leaders attached to the state supplemental budget that April for lawmaker consideration -- and what eventually came before them as a separate bill -- was a $125-million proposal. It had a name: the Job Creation Guaranty Program. The added $75 million in loan guarantees was precisely the amount Schilling had told state leaders in private he needed in capital, Stokes told The Journal in 2010. The name of the company was not included in the legislation and rank-and-file members in the House or Senate were not told that 38 Studios or any other specific company would be getting a big chunk of the pot, several lawmakers told the newspaper. In their letter to The Sun last week, Algiere and his colleagues said: "When we voted in favor of the Job Creation Guaranty program nothing in the budget article or in the act that passed specifically referenced 38 Studios. Our ‘yea’ votes were cast with the understanding that many small businesses around the state would have access to the $125 million loan program." In a telephone interview, Algiere raised a good question: would the loan program actually have passed unanimously in the Senate and with only one opponent in the House "if we knew $75 million could be going to one entity? I doubt it. That’s a high risk, start-up company." The legislation’s lone dissenter, Rep. Robert Watson, R-East Greenwich, said in a phone interview that he smelled a "scandal waiting to happen" behind all the secrecy. "38 Studios was never mentioned on the floor as a subject or even a concept," said Watson, "but I got up and railed against [the legislation] just as a generic principle because I feared there was something afoot. Programs that start out as $50 million and balloon to $125 million in a week’s notice, well, there is something up. Someone was going to get it." A videotape of the hearing on the bill supports Watson’s claim. Our ruling Algiere and his fellow legislators from Westerly and Charlestown say the legislature was never given the opportunity to debate or vote on loaning $75 million to 38 Studios. While the legislature did overwhelmingly approve the $125-million loan guarantee fund, it’s clear from news stories at the time and afterward, and from the tape of the debate, that rank-and-file legislators did not know when they voted that $75 million was meant for 38 Studios, even if some of their leaders did. Whether they should have been more skeptical of the loan guarantee fund is another question. We rule the legislators’ statement True (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-13557	"The fact is" the Clinton Foundation has "got about 80 percent in overhead and 20 percent of the money is actually getting into the places it should."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/25/reince-priebus/reince-priebus-false-claim-80-clinton-foundation-c/	In a radio interview Aug. 23, 2016, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus wrongly interpreted tax forms submitted by the Clinton Foundation to claim that the foundation spends the vast majority of its donations on overhead and not charitable work. Speaking on The Mike Gallagher Show, Priebus described the foundation as a way to make the Clintons rich and said he couldn’t find examples of charitable work that they do. "And so, these people ask the question in interviews, especially in the liberal media, you know, well ‘don’t you think they do great work?’ Well, I don’t know what great work they do," Priebus said. "I mean the fact is, is if they’ve got about 80 percent overhead and 20 percent of the money's actually getting into the place that it should, then it seems like the only work that the Clinton Foundation is doing is lining the pockets of Bill and Hillary Clinton. And that, to me, should be investigated …" The claim that 80 percent of the money the foundation raises goes to overhead -- a term used to described expenses that go to management and fundraising costs -- is something that has been made by Carly Fiorina and Rush Limbaugh in varying forms. But, despite what Priebus says, it’s an incorrect reading of tax forms submitted by the foundation, experts who monitor and study charitable organizations say. We did not hear back from RNC spokesman Sean Spicer. A wrong reading Priebus’ case is built on the notion that the only charitable work the Clinton Foundation does is in grant-making and, by extension, everything else is overhead. We’ll use the Clinton Foundation’s most recent IRS tax form, for 2014, as an example. (It starts on Page 28 of this document.) The foundation reported total expenses in 2014 of a little over $91 million but grants of just $5.1 million. That’s close to 6 percent of the foundation’s money being spent on grants. Over a five-year period from 2009-12, the foundation raised over $500 million, the conservative website The Federalist reported, but only 15 percent of that, or $75 million, went toward grants. But that doesn’t mean everything else is overhead, people who monitor charities and their practices say. "Although it has ‘foundation’ in its name, the Clinton Foundation is actually a public charity," Brian Mittendorf, a professor of accounting at Ohio State University’s Fisher College of Business, wrote in the Chronicle of Philanthropy. "In practical terms, this means both that it relies heavily on donations from the public and that it achieves its mission primarily by using those donations to conduct direct charitable activities, as opposed to providing grants from an endowment. "Failure to understand the difference led to the widespread claim (covered by the New York Post, Rush Limbaugh, Fox News, and others) that only a small portion of Clinton Foundation spending goes toward charity. While measuring charitable endeavors by the amount of grants awarded may be appropriate for many private foundations, it is not for an organization that acts as a direct service provider like the Clinton Foundation." What kind of activities? The Clinton Development Initiative is helping farmers in Malawi grow and sell more crops and has built a warehouse where farmers can store their crops for sale. The foundation is doing something similar for coffee farmers in Haiti. In 2013, the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership launched the Acceso Centro de Formacion to provide job training for people in Cartagena, Colombia. A lot of what the foundation does is have its employees help facilitate partnerships. The Clinton Health Access Initiative, for instance, has gotten credit for providing access to lower-cost drugs for millions of people with HIV/AIDS. The foundation program consolidated both the supply of raw materials to make the drugs and the bidding to supply the finished product. The result was lower production costs and lower drug prices. Today, the initiative tracks the going price for a menu of treatments and posts them to help health departments around the world as they negotiate with drug companies. Mittendorf and other people who study charities say the most general way to address how much a group spends on charities versus overhead is to look at the audited financial statements that consolidate the financial results of the entities that make up the Clinton Foundation. That include the Clinton Health Access Initiative, Clinton Global Initiative, Clinton Climate Initiative, Clinton Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative, Clinton Development Initiative, and Clinton Health Matters Initiative. Financial statement rules require a nonprofit to split its expenses between program services, fundraising, and management/general costs (the latter two are collectively what are referred to as "overhead"), Mittendorf told us. He said that in 2014, 87.2 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s expenses were on program services. "Of course, this only speaks to how the organization used its funds and not whether that 87.2 percent was allocated to the most effective program efforts, but it is all we have in terms of verifiable data on this question," Mittendorf said. The American Institute of Philanthropy’s Charity Watch, reached the same conclusion. It has given the Clinton Foundation an A rating and says it spends only 12 percent of the money it raises on "overhead." "The Clinton Foundation is an excellent charity," Charity Watch president Daniel Borochoff said Aug. 24, 2016, on CNN. "They are able to get 88 percent of their spending to bona fide program services and their fundraising efficiency is really low. It only costs them $2 to raise $100." Sandra Minuitti at the group Charity Navigator used the same general calculation when talking to our colleagues FactCheck.org, though she did not include the Clinton Foundation’s affiliates. By that measure, in 2013, 80.6 percent of spending was on program services. Our ruling Priebus said, "The fact is" the Clinton Foundation has "got about 80 percent in overhead and 20 percent of the money is actually getting into the places it should." Priebus is incorrectly reading IRS documents. Only a small amount of the donations collected by the Clinton Foundation are awarded as grants to other nonprofit groups. But that doesn’t mean that every other dollar is "overhead." The Clinton Foundation spends between 80-90 percent on program services, which experts say is the standard in the industry to define charitable works. It spends the majority of its money directly on projects rather than through third-party grants. Conversely, only between 10-20 percent is spent on management of the foundation and fundraising activities, which is tagged as "overhead." Priebus’ claim rates False.

pomt-04005	"We’re taxing our small businesses now at rates higher than corporations."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/feb/07/paul-ryan/rep-paul-ryan-says-small-businesses-are-now-taxed-/	Emerging after a quiet post-election period, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan sat for questions from David Gregory, moderator of NBC’s Meet the Press, who posited that many business owners want Washington to cut a fiscal deal that includes tax increases. Ryan begged to differ. "They believe we should have tax reform," Ryan, the 2012 GOP vice presidential candidate, said during his Jan. 27, 2013 appearance. "We have the highest corporate tax rate in the world. We’re taxing our small businesses now at rates higher than corporations. We should have lower tax rates so we can be competitive." It’s well established that the U.S. corporate tax rate of 35 percent is the highest in the world, at least on paper. But is America "taxing our small businesses now at rates higher than corporations"? The starting point here is the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, the law spawned by the New Year’s Day deal that prevented the nation from heading over the "fiscal cliff" of spending cuts that was set to trigger in 2013. Among many other things, the cliff deal left the federal corporate tax rate at 35 percent, but raised the top personal tax rate to 39.6 percent. Ryan voted for the bill, bucking a majority of his fellow Republicans. Democrats were overwhelmingly in favor. The final tally was 257-167. The change in individual income tax rates is relevant to business owners because some small businesses and large firms structure themselves as "pass-through" entities such as S corporations or partnerships, rather than traditional corporations. Profits for those entities are taxed under the individual income tax code rather than under the corporate tax structure. Tax experts we consulted agreed that the cliff legislation means that at least some small business owners will be paying more than corporations. So there is a basis for Ryan’s claim. But there are problems with his broad statement that, "We’re taxing our small businesses now at rates higher than corporations." Ryan’s claim, unqualified as it is, leaves the listener with the impression that the higher rates are just a fact of life for small businesses under the bill signed by President Barack Obama. That’s not the case. There is not yet a study that analyzes how small business would be affected by the taxation changes in the American Taxpayer Relief Act. But Ryan’s office pointed us to a pair of federal government reports that included projections of how earlier Obama tax proposals might affect businesses. They cited parts of the studies that found Obama’s plans meant that about half of all net business income would have been subject to rates over the 35 percent corporate rate. That suggests a broad effect. But both of the figures refer to business income, not just small business income. They are not one and the same. As PolitiFact Ohio noted in January 2013, "pass through" businesses that actually file under the individual income-tax code include some very large outfits, including "sole proprietorships and such partnerships as big law firms and financial funds. Goldman Sachs was classified as a partnership before it went public in 1999." One of the studies cited by Ryan, an August 2010 report by the Joint Committee on Taxation, did not attempt to define small business. The other Ryan-cited study did attempt to define small businesses from within that larger pool. It was a 2011 report by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Tax Analysis using 2007 tax data. It’s dated, but is the most comprehensive try at the subjective task of defining what is a small business, and it is widely cited by tax researchers. The study, as Ryan’s camp noted, found about 50 percent of business income was on returns filed by taxpayers who were in the top tax bracket. (It was that top tax rate that was raised for 2013.) But when that same study filtered out larger businesses, the percentage of affected business income dropped to 24 percent to 27 percent, depending on the definition of small business. We found another measure in the report that is relevant to this claim -- the total number of businesses. Looking just at what it defined as small businesses, the Treasury study found that "approximately half of our small businesses reported total income less than $50,000, and almost 90 percent reported net income less than $50,000." That is nowhere near the threshold for the highest tax rate. So, the tax rate for pass-through business income at that level would be nowhere near a point greater than the corporate rate of 35 percent. What’s more, only 2 percent or 3 percent of "pass through" entities defined in the Treasury study as small businesses were at the top tax rate. That study is dated, but the finding is relevant because the new top rate (39.6 percent) under the fiscal-cliff deal applies to nearly the same income levels as the old top rate. We heard that from tax experts at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution’s Tax Policy Center, the Tax Foundation and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities -- groups that span the ideological spectrum. There’s another issue with Ryan’s statement, pointed out by Joseph Rosenberg, a researcher at the Tax Policy Center, a joint Urban Institute-Brookings Institution project. Because the Treasury study is from 2011, it analyzed an earlier Obama proposal, not the fiscal cliff legislation (the American Taxpayer Relief Act). The earlier proposal would have raised more high-earning taxpayers into a new bracket above 35 percent than does the cliff deal. On the other hand, William McBride of the Tax Foundation told us the number of pass-through entities has grown relative to the number of corporations since 2007, the year the Treasury study analyzed. And the fiscal-cliff deal could affect business taxes in other ways, including through its new limits on tax deductions. Finally, it should be noted that small business owners are not forced to file under the individual tax code. If they are being bumped into a higher tax rate because of the 2013 vote, they could reorganize and file under the corporate tax rate, which was unchanged. Many won’t because there are advantages to passing through income to individual taxpayers, said Chuck Marr and Chye-Ching Huang of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. McBride addressed the same point. "Yes, pass-through businesses can choose to file as c-corporations, but it is a costly and lengthy process," he wrote in an email. "Plus, the c-corporation tax rate is the highest in the developed world. Out of the fry pan and into the fire." Our rating Ryan’s critique of the U.S. tax system included a remark that, "We’re taxing our small businesses now at rates higher than corporations." That will be true in some cases, applying to a not-insubstantial amount of business profits. But a credible study suggests that many, or even most, small-businesses have income that the new top tax rate won’t touch. And the system allows them to file under the corporate tax system if they so desire. Ryan’s statement has an element of truth but ignores facts that would leave a different impression. That’s our definition of Mostly False.	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2013-02-07T09:00:00	2013-01-27	['None']
pomt-12914	"House Bill 6627 also requires the applicant to attest to their eligibility to vote, as is required by the National Voter Registration Act and used by all other states that have (automatic voter registration)."	true	/illinois/statements/2017/jan/17/mike-fortner/fortners-claim-about-automatic-voter-registration-/	Sponsors of a new bill to make voter registration automatic with issuance of Illinois driver’s licenses say it fulfills federal standards for proving voter eligibility and protects against fraud. Gov. Bruce Rauner vetoed the state's first attempt at automatic voter registration (AVR) over questions about fraud and federal compliance. But the chief co-sponsor of the new legislation, state Rep. Mike Fortner, R-West Chicago, wrote in an op-ed that his bill "requires the applicant to attest to their eligibility to vote, as is required by the National Voter Registration Act and used by all other states that have (automatic voter registration)." With automatic voter registration gaining momentum in recent years, we decided to look into Fortner’s claim to see whether states that have authorized AVR do in fact require applicants to attest to their eligibility to vote. Automatic voter registration in the U.S. Illinois’ attempt to institute automatic voter registration failed after Rauner vetoed Senate Bill 250 over concerns it could violate federal election law and open the door to voter fraud. Rauner said he supports modernizing the state’s election system and easing voter access, and noted in his veto message that with a few changes, he could get behind a future version of the bill. That new version was introduced Nov. 15 by House Republican leader Jim Durkin in the form of House Bill 6627. Later that month, Fortner penned an op-ed explaining how the GOP-backed legislation addresses the issues raised by the governor. Six states -- Alaska, California, Connecticut, Oregon, Vermont and West Virginia -- and the District of Columbia have enacted AVR as of Dec. 8, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In March 2015, Oregon became the first state in the nation to pass a law that allows for the automatic registration of eligible residents applying for or renewing a driver’s license, except those who opt out. Most recently, voters in Alaska approved a November ballot measure to allow AVR through the state’s Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD), which pays a sum to eligible residents who have lived in Alaska for a full calendar year. Once the system is in place, eligible voters, unless they decline, either would be registered automatically or have their existing voter information updated when they complete their annual PFD applications. A total of 29 states considered measures in 2016 to automatically register residents who conduct business with state government agencies and transmit voter information electronically to election officials, according to the New York University School of Law’s Brennan Center for Justice. In addition to Illinois, New Jersey was the only other state whose legislature passed an automatic voter registration bill that ended up being vetoed by the governor. Requirements of automatic voter registration Fortner writes in his op-ed that unlike SB 250, the legislation he’s sponsoring requires an applicant to attest to their eligibility to vote, which he says is required by the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, also referred to as the "Motor Voter Act." The language in Fortner’s bill states that a driver’ license/voter registration application must, "unless the applicant declines to register to vote or change his or her registered residence address, require the applicant to attest, by signature under penalty of perjury, to meeting the qualifications to register to vote in Illinois at his or her residence address as indicated on his or her driver's license or identification card application." Federal law mandates states include a voter registration form as part of any application for obtaining or renewing a driver’s license. These applications only can require the minimum amount of information necessary to allow state officials to determine the eligibility of an applicant. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, a "voter registration application must state each voter eligibility requirement (including citizenship), contain an attestation that the applicant meets each requirement, state the penalties provided by law for submission of a false voter registration application and require the signature of the applicant under penalty of perjury." Under SB 250, the Secretary of State’s Driver Services Department would have been permitted to send all information pertaining to an applicant’s identity, address and citizenship to the Illinois State Board of Elections, "regardless of whether or not the individual attested to his or her eligibility to register to vote." That language was one of the sticking points for Republicans who opposed the bill, and was underscored in the governor’s veto message. "Senate Bill 250 does not require an applicant to attest to meeting the qualifications to vote or to sign the application, as required by federal law," Rauner wrote in his veto message. "The bill relies on the State Board of Elections to screen out individuals who are not eligible to vote, even though the State Board may not have access to that information." Do all states with AVR require applicants to attest to their eligibility to vote? The second part of Fortner’s statement claims all states with automatic voter registration require applicants to attest to their eligibility to vote. In a phone interview, Fortner said his staff had verified that each state with automatic registration requires applicants to attest to their eligibility to vote. Jonathan Brater, counsel for the Brennan Center for Justice’s Democracy Program, referred to the attestation requirement as an "in-the-weeds legal issue." Brater said it’s difficult to make an apples-to-apples comparison among states with automatic registration because eligibility requirements are collected differently in each state. He added that the attestation requirement outlined in the motor voter law is from a time when computers weren’t used for voter registration, and that the "specific wording of the law doesn’t really reflect how states do it" today. At least 33 states use electronic registration at DMVs and about 39 currently or soon will offer online voter registration. Both are available in Illinois. "The real problem with the National Voter Registration Act so far is that not enough people are getting to register to vote," Brater said. "Automatic voter registration fulfills the promise of the law that other attempts to implement have not." While states with automatic voter registration do collect eligibility information differently, an analysis of legislation passed by state legislatures shows applicants must attest that they meet the qualifications to vote and/or sign the application form. Here’s a look at AVR requirements in those states: Our ruling In a November op-ed about a Republican-backed automatic voter registration bill, Fortner wrote, "House Bill 6627 also requires the applicant to attest to their eligibility to vote, as is required by the National Voter Registration Act and used by all other states that have AVR." Fortner argued the House Republican’s automatic voter registration legislation addresses the concerns raised by Rauner when he vetoed SB 250 on Aug. 12. The bill would have permitted the Secretary of State to electronically send information pertaining to an applicant’s identity, address and citizenship to the State Board of Elections, "regardless of whether or not the individual attested to his or her eligibility to register to vote," according to the language of the bill. The West Chicago Republican’s claim that the National Voter Registration Act requires applicants to attest to their eligibility to vote, as do all the states that have automatic voter registration is accurate. An analysis of the legislation passed by the six states and Washington, D.C., that have enacted AVR shows all of them require applicants to attest to their eligibility to vote with a signature, and none had language similar to that of Illinois’ bill.

pomt-12529	"Trump on revamping the military: We’re bringing back the draft."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/apr/21/realnewsrightnowcom/internet-story-claiming-trump-wants-renew-military/	A fake news article that said then-candidate Donald Trump would reinstitute the military draft should he be elected president was actually posted on a parody site early in 2016. An April 29, 2016, article on the website RealNewsRightNow.com with the headline "Trump on revamping the military: We’re bringing back the draft" has enjoyed something of a resurgence on Facebook. Users recently reported the story as possibly being fabricated, as part of Facebook’s efforts to cut down on fake news. The post includes bogus quotes of Trump at a campaign rally in Costa Mesa, Calif., telling a crowd that he wants to re-establish conscription, which ended in the United States in 1973. "We’re bringing back the draft, OK? We’re going to bring it back, and we’re going to make America as strong as we were in the Sixties," he’s quoted. He also goes on to say "was a very big supporter of the Vietnam war and, of course, the troops." Except Trump never said those things (although he was in Costa Mesa for a rally that day). RealNewsRightNow.com is a parody site attempting to write for comedic effect. Their About Us page doesn’t carry any sort of disclaimer, but it’s apparent from the absurd biography written for alleged founder R. Hobbus J.D that the site is a joke. Besides multiple Pulitzer Prizes and Nobel Peace Prize nominations, Hobbus apparently won the fictional Stephen Glass Distinction in Journalistic Integrity, for example. Glass was a notorious fabricator of scads of people and quotes in stories he wrote for The New Republic. He was exposed back in 1998, before we used the trendy term "fake news." It’s also clear from the other stories on the site that the news is fake.

pomt-02230	"The U.S. spends more money on its military than the 16 biggest military budgets in the world" combined.	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/16/anissa-naouai/rt-anchor-says-us-spends-big-military/	A correspondent for RT, the English-language cable news network funded by the government of Russia, and CNN anchor Chris Cuomo recently debated the ongoing crisis in Ukraine and the media’s role. Cuomo suggested that CNN and other American media outlets are right to question to what extent Russia is meddling in the events in Ukraine. RT correspondent Anissa Naouai took the opposite tack, saying that the American media is believing everything the government in Kiev is saying while claiming news coming out of Russia is propaganda. You can watch the debate here if you like, but what struck us was a claim by Naouai about the American military. When Cuomo described the United States as "war weary," Naouai responded: "War weary?" she asked. "The U.S. spends more money on its military than the 16 biggest military budgets in the world. I wouldn’t call the U.S. military weary." From the context, it is clear that Naouai was talking about the next 16 biggest military budgets in the world combined. That’s what we decided to check. We found two credible groups that attempt to track military spending around the globe, the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London think tank, and the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. There are flaws in each group’s numbers -- the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute uses budget figures (not expenditures), and some countries don’t release detailed information on military spending -- but they are generally considered the best approximations available. For the record, Naouai referred us to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, but we’ll look at both. Both groups recently released data for 2013. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute put the U.S. defense budget at just over $600 billion, while the International Institute for Strategic Studies uses a figure of $640 billion. Either number dwarfs the amount of spending by any other country, and plenty of countries combined, both groups conclude. But not the 16 next-biggest countries combined, as Naouai claimed on CNN. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the next 16 biggest militaries spent $801 billion in 2013, and the United States spends as much on the military as the next eight countries combined (China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan and India). Graphic: Stockholm International Peace Research Institute The International Institute for Strategic Studies only makes the top 15 spenders available for free. According to their analysis, the United States spent $600 billion on defense while the next 14 countries spent a combined $634.5 billion. By the International Institute for Strategic Studies analysis, the United States spends as much as the next 12 biggest countries combined. Graphic: International Institute for Strategic Studies Our ruling Naouai said, "The U.S. spends more money on its military than the 16 biggest military budgets in the world." The United States is definitely No. 1 on the world’s defense spending list. But its expenditures don’t eclipse the next 16 biggest counties combined as Naouai said, according to two independent groups. While we don't think viewers would get a markedly different impression if Naouai had said 8 or 12 instead of 16, her figures are off by a significant-enough margin. As such, we rate her statement Half True.	None	Anissa Naouai	None	None	None	2014-04-16T17:42:08	2014-04-16	['United_States']
pomt-12623	Says there is a "traditional 60-vote threshold for confirming Supreme Court nominees."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2017/mar/31/maggie-hassan/hassan-says-gorsuch-should-be-held-60-vote-thresho/	New Hampshire’s Sen. Maggie Hassan is the latest Senate Democrat to claim that Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch should be held to a 60 vote-standard in order to be confirmed. In a letter she wrote on March 28 explaining why she would vote against Gorsuch, Hassan referred to "the traditional 60-vote threshold for confirming Supreme Court nominees." So is 60 votes the "traditional" magic number that Supreme Court nominees need to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate? In reality, Gorsuch, like all other Supreme Court Justice nominees, needs only a simple majority to be confirmed by the Senate. And superficially at least, the idea of a 60-vote threshold would seem to be contradicted by the experiences of Clarence Thomas, nominated in 1991 and confirmed on a 52-48 vote, and Samuel Alito, nominated in 2006 and confirmed on a 58-42 vote. However, Senate procedure is complicated, leading to misunderstandings. So let’s walk through the process. How confirmation works First, a nominee must testify in a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which Gorsuch did last week. Once the committee passes the nomination -- and the Republican-led committee is expected to easily clear Gorsuch -- it goes to the full Senate. The process requires the Senate majority leader to take the chamber into an executive session, the setting in which nominees are confirmed, according to Worth Hester, the assistant director of the Georgetown Government Affairs Institute. There, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., will either get unanimous consent, a process by which every senator agrees to schedule a vote on a nominee, or in the case of an objection, would need to invoke cloture, the process to end debate and force a vote. Under a cloture vote, the Senate agrees to place a time limit on the consideration of a nominee. A successful cloture requires 60 votes. After the cloture vote, Senate rules allow for 30 additional hours of debate, and then a final confirmation vote occurs, according to Sarah Binder, political scientist at George Washington University and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. If Senate Democrats filibuster Gorsuch’s nomination, McConnell would need to invoke cloture. Today, there are 52 Republican senators, so under current rules, the Republicans would need eight Democrats to join them to reach the cloture threshold. That’s a difficult challenge in today’s polarized Congress. If there aren’t enough votes for cloture, McConnell could choose to "go nuclear" - that is, suspend the rules about how many votes Gorsuch would need to end the filibuster, changing it to a simple majority. (Here’s a more detailed discussion of the "nuclear option.") The 60-vote talking point Given the partisan combat over Gorsuch’s nomination, the "60-vote threshold" has become a widely repeated Democratic talking point. When we asked Hassan’s staff to clarify her statement about the "traditional 60-vote threshold," they referred PolitiFact New Hampshire to a list of prior Supreme Court nominees, saying that every one confirmed to the Supreme Court since the Eisenhower administration except for two (Alito and Thomas) either received "unanimous support or has met the sixty vote threshold." "This is the traditional 60 vote threshold that Senator Hassan believes should be maintained," said Hassan’s spokeswoman Meira Bernstein. The problem for Democrats who make this argument is that filibustering a Supreme Court nominee and taking a cloture vote is far from "traditional" in Supreme Court nominations. In fact, it’s only happened four times in modern history, according to the Washington Post Fact Checker. The chamber voted on cloture when Justice Alito was nominated in 2006, and it did the same in 1968, 1971 and 1986. PolitiFact and the Washington Post Fact Checker have looked skeptically on claims about the 60-vote standard, including comments by Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Bernie Sanders I-Vt., referring to a requirement or a standard of 60 votes. Both of President Barack Obama’s nominees won 60 votes and then some. The Senate confirmed Sonia Sotomayor in 2009 by a vote of 68-31, and confirmed Elena Kagan by a roll call vote of 63-37 in 2010. However, while the margins achieved by Sotomayor and Kagan would seem to support Hassan’s argument that confirmations require 60 votes, it’s not that simple. Those nominations were never filibustered, so no 60-vote cloture motion was required. Even though the margins were greater, the final confirmations required only 51 votes. Our ruling Hassan said that there is a "traditional 60-vote threshold for confirming Supreme Court nominees." Most Supreme Court nominees have indeed reached 60 votes. But not all have, and the official standard remains 50 percent plus one, not 60. And while a 60-vote supermajority for cloture is often required these days for much of the Senate’s business, filing for cloture is actually the exception, not the rule, where recent Supreme Court nominations are concerned. Cloture votes have been required in only four of the 23 confirmations since the Eisenhower Administration. This calls into question Hassan’s use of the term "traditional."

pomt-04859	Says U.S. Senate rival Tommy Thompson is "a big corporate lobbyist" and has been "lobbying during the middle of the campaign."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/aug/10/eric-hovde/eric-hovde-says-tommy-thompson-big-corporate-lobby/	On the U.S. Senate campaign trail, one of the four Republican candidates answers to "Governor" but most often just plain "Tommy." Just don’t call Tommy Thompson a lobbyist. Republican rival candidate Eric Hovde and Democrats have rankled Thompson with the label "corporate lobbyist." It’s a pointed reference to Thompson’s lucrative private-sector affiliation with dozens of health and other companies that have benefitted from the connections and experience Thompson gained in Washington, D.C. Some of the companies deal with industry regulators that Thompson oversaw as Secretary of Health and Human Services during the George W. Bush administration. In January 2012, the Journal Sentinel reported Thompson’s net worth has reached roughly $13 million, much of in the seven years since he left government and began a career as corporate consultant and advisor, executive, investor and speaker. Thompson says the "corporate lobbyist" label is flat out false. But Hovde, in a July 26, 2012 interview with Jerry Bader on WTAQ-AM in Green Bay, pressed the claim, even saying Thompson was "lobbying during the middle of the campaign." Is Hovde right? Even during the campaign? Hovde makes three points in support of his statement: Thompson’s employment at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld in Washington, D.C.; a media report on Thompson contacting a North Carolina lawmaker; and a campaign-donation report that listed Thompson’s occupation as "lobbyist." Washington firm Hovde correctly calls Akin Gump a "lobbying firm" -- it’s considered a Washington lobbying powerhouse. But it’s also an international law firm, and Thompson, an attorney, was listed as a partner before he left in January 2012 to campaign for U.S. Senate. Some Akin Gump partners are registered lobbyists while others, such as Thompson, are not registered to lobby, according to public databases of federal lobbyists. Thompson points to his unregistered status as proof he’s not a lobbyist. But does that mean Thompson doesn’t lobby federal officials? Not by itself. Federal law requires individuals to register as lobbyists if they have more than one lobbying contact in a three-month period while representing a client. The work must make up at least 20 percent of the lobbyist’s work for a client. Thompson, then, could limit such contacts, put his influence to work, and still fly beneath the rules. "We have at least 3,000 unregistered lobbyists, and the number is probably far higher than that," said Howard Marlowe, a lobbying firm president and head of the American League of Lobbyists, who spoke in general and not specifically about Thompson. So, Hovde proves nothing by pointing to Thompson’s employer and didn’t point to a single lobbying incident. Thompson’s defense, meanwhile, is a point in his favor but does not close the case. Telephone call Hovde referred us to a May 2012 Bloomberg news account -- confirmed by Thompson -- in which the former governor called the speaker of the North Carolina state House of Representatives about a state bill toughening regulations on controversial dental management companies. Private-equity firms have invested heavily in such firms, and Thompson has consulted with several private-equity firms, leading to speculation he was lobbying against the bill -- and right in the midst of the Senate race. But the North Carolina lawmaker, Thom Tillis, says he and Thompson never connected. Thompson told us he called not on behalf of a paying client, but a "friend of a friend" -- whose name he could not recall -- who wanted to know when the bill would be considered. So, at best that part of the claim is murky. Campaign report Finally, there’s the matter of U.S. Sen. John Hoeven (R-North Dakota) listing Thompson as a "lobbyist" on a 2010 campaign report showing a $1,000 donation from Thompson. There is a document showing that in Federal Election Commission records. Thompson’s campaign says Thompson didn’t list himself that way, suggesting that Hoeven’s campaign erroneously wrote in that occupation. Hoeven’s campaign did not get back to us. The big picture We could not find any media references that labeled Thompson a lobbyist. One Thompson affiliation that drew our attention was his role as chairman of an advisory board at Constella Group, a North Carolina medical research firm. Constella’s CEO has said Thompson was brought on to "connect" the company with U.S. and foreign governments and advise it on growth strategies. Constella then agreed to hire Akin Gump -- but not Thompson specifically -- as its lobbyist, the Journal Sentinel reported in 2007. That’s getting closer to what a lobbyist does, but Thompson told us nothing he did for Constella constituted lobbying, and we found no evidence otherwise. In Washington, the kind of work Thompson does is often described as either a "strategic advice" consultant or a "rainmaker" whose influence and connections bring work to his firm. Bill Broydrick, a veteran lobbyist in Wisconsin and Washington, put it this way: "A consultant’s responsibility is to give his or her client their best professional advice, and that is not lobbying. That’s telling people how they should lobby." Indeed, Thompson has told reporters that he does work with a lobbyist at Akin Gump who lobbies for health care clients. An Akin Gump spokesman told us: "Gov. Thompson was a strategic adviser in Akin Gump’s health care practice, and did not engage in any activity that required him to register as a lobbyist." Thompson’s situation reminds us somewhat of the debate during the GOP presidential primary over Newt Gingrich’s statement that he "never lobbied under any circumstance" for Freddie Mac, a mortgage company giant connected to the federal government. Gingrich acknowledged that Freddie Mac hired his consulting group but he said it was only for strategic advice and broadening contacts among conservatives, not lobbying. In rating Gingrich’s claim Half True, PolitiFact National said he was technically correct but took pains to avoid being subject to the lobbying rules and use his influence as an adviser. Thompson appears to have taken similar pains. He told us Akin Gump wanted him to register as a lobbyist, but he refused. He is far less definitive when asked directly if he has ever contacted a legislator on behalf of any corporate client to urge action on a bill. He first told us he didn’t think he had, but then said couched it to say he couldn’t say for sure. Not exactly a denial. Our conclusion Hovde claims Thompson was a corporate lobbyist and has even lobbied during the current campaign. By the official definition, Hovde is off. Thompson is not a registered lobbyist and the the only significant evidence of direct contact with an elected official is the North Carolina example. On the other hand, it’s clear that Thompson has sold his influence and connections to firms to whom it would benefit on Capitol Hill, but did so in a way -- as a consultant -- to avoid having to register. As with the Gingrich claim, we rate this one Half True.	None	Eric Hovde	None	None	None	2012-08-10T13:26:42	2012-08-12	['Tommy_Thompson', 'United_States']
pomt-07900	"The two worst counties for (Medicaid) fraud in the country -- not state -- are Dade and Broward county."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/feb/03/ron-saunders/saunders-says-dade-broward-rule-country-medicaid-f/	South Florida has a reputation as a place ripe for fraud and crime -- including bilking the government. State Rep. Ron Saunders, the Democratic minority leader from Key West, has slapped a more specific label on a costly problem in South Florida: Medicaid fraud. "The two worst counties for fraud in the country -- not state -- are Dade and Broward county," he told a roomful of reporters on Jan. 19, 2011, during an Associated Press preview of Florida's upcoming legislative session. It's easy to find news articles describing South Florida as a mecca for such fraud -- with labels such as "ground zero" or mind-boggling tales of abuse. But the word "worst" caught our eye -- are the South Florida counties of Miami-Dade and Broward truly the "worst" in the country for Medicaid fraud? Medicaid, a health care program for low-income individuals, is administered by the states and receives some federal funding. The Truth-O-Meter has weighed in multiple times on fact-checks related to the high cost and growth of Medicaid, including a claim by Pam Bondi, now Florida's attorney general, and Bill McCollum, Florida's previous attorney general. For more background, check out this website of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. We spoke to Saunders directly on Jan. 20, who told us that his statement was in response to a question about how to resolve the state's budget crisis. Saunders said it's a "no-brainer" to cut back on fraud such as in Medicare and Medicaid rather than make more cuts in areas such as education. But after a lot of calls and research, we can say one thing for certain: Nobody tracks county-by-county Medicaid fraud nationally. Even within Florida, a county breakdown is not available. So we're going to rely on expert opinions and documented trends in this ruling. Mark Hollis, spokesperson for the House Democratic caucus, sent us links to newspaper articles and government reports about Medicaid fraud in South Florida. Among the sources Hollis cited was a March 2009 article in Health News Florida, quoting state Sen. Don Gaetz saying: "Since we have the worst problem in the nation, we need the most effective solution." Hollis also sent us a December 2005 article in HomeCare, an industry publication, quoting FBI agent Michael Clemens, who was in charge of the Miami field office at the time, saying: "South Florida is ground zero for health care fraud." But neither article provides any documentation to support that "worst" label. Hollis also sent us links to a House bill and recent government reports about Medicaid fraud. House Bill 1487 in 2009, which labeled Miami-Dade an area of "special concern," was intended to rein in Medicaid fraud. The Senate version, Senate Bill 2658, was signed into law in June 2009. The staff analysis outlined the rampant growth in home health care agencies in Florida: Of the 431 licensure applications in 2007, 58.5 percent were in Miami-Dade. In that county, the number of licensed agencies grew 414 percent between August 1999 and March 6, 2009. The analysis also stated that "While Miami-Dade has about 20 percent of Florida’s Medicaid population and about 33 percent of Florida’s residents over the age of 60, 91 percent of the state reimbursement for certain home health services were going to Miami-Dade." While the bill analysis doesn't provide data ranking all of Florida's counties, it certainly suggests that Miami-Dade has an overwhelmingly disproportionate share of Medicaid dollars -- and fraud. Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration, which administers the Medicaid program, has a report from 2009-10 that also provides some insight. Although the 94-page report does not describe Broward and Miami-Dade as the worst in the nation, it noted: • "Home health agencies have been an acknowledged area of health care fraud in recent years. For the four fiscal years ending June 30, 2009, approximately 90 percent of Medicaid expenditures for home health aide visits were made to providers in Miami‐Dade County, while only about 20 percent of Medicaid recipients reside in that area. At the end of the fiscal year, there were 339 home health agencies in Miami‐Dade County actively enrolled in the Medicaid program and only 293 in the other 66 counties combined." (Page 53) • Statutes were changed in 2008 and 2009 to address home-health fraud. Forty-seven licensure denials for home health agencies were upheld in FY 2009-10 for fraud-related reasons. Thirty-one of the denials (66 percent) were in Miami-Dade County. (Page 65) We reached out to several agencies that have a role in Medicaid. Both the Florida Attorney General, which has a Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, and AHCA said they had no nationwide county-by-county information to support or refute Saunders' claim. Don White, spokesman for the Office of Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, also told us that the federal government has "no statistics on Medicaid fraud." As for Saunders' claim that Dade and Broward are the "worst" in the country, White said: "Do we have the numbers? No. Is he probably correct? Yes." We ran Saunders' claim by Alan Levine, a former secretary at AHCA under Gov. Jeb Bush and an expert on Medicaid. "I have absolutely no doubt South Florida is among the highest," Levine wrote in an e-mail. "Others that likely run in the same circle are New York and New Jersey. But South Florida, from all the experience I have, clearly leads the way." Levine sent us a 2009 report, "Stop Paying the Crooks," by the Center for Health Transformation, an organization founded by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. It stated that the U.S. Department of Justice labeled "South Florida -- and more specifically, Miami-Dade County --Ground Zero for health care fraud in America." But no numbers ranking counties nationwide. We sent Saunders' claim to Craig Smith, the attorney who wrote the South Florida chapter, who works at Hogan Lovells law firm in Miami. "Whatever the exact figure is, there can be no question that the bulk of the fraud, waste and abuse is occurring in Miami-Dade and Broward counties," Smith wrote to us in an e-mail Feb. 1. "Based on the size of Florida's Medicaid program, you can fairly eliminate about 45 states from the comparative discussion." So let's review: Saunders said that "The two worst counties for (Medicaid) fraud in the country -- not state -- are Dade and Broward county." We could not find any government office that could point to numbers ranking counties across the nation in terms of Medicaid fraud. But we found four experts -- one from the federal Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, one a former secretary of the state's AHCA, a spokesperson from a national organization that provides information on health care fraud and an attorney who specializes in health care law -- who all agree that Saunders is likely right. At PolitiFact Florida, we dig for data to support claims by politicians -- and Saunders and our experts haven't provided hard numbers to prove him right. But the fact that four experts -- including one appointed by a Republican governor -- generally back up the Democratic minority leader or say that the two counties are at least among the worst in the nation carries weight with us. We rate Saunders’ claim Mostly True.	None	Ron Saunders	None	None	None	2011-02-03T11:51:44	2011-01-19	['None']
pomt-10734	''The leading Democratic candidate once said that the unfettered free market is the most destructive force in modern America.''	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/13/rudy-giuliani/distorting-the-view/	One of Rudy Giuliani's frequent targets on the campaign trail is Hillary Clinton. And one of his frequent lines is: ''The free market is . . . one of our greatest assets. And the leading Democratic candidate once said that the unfettered free market is the most destructive force in modern America. I mean, just get an idea of where the philosophy comes from.'' Except Clinton never called the free market ''destructive.'' Giuliani is blatantly — and repeatedly — misquoting a line from her 1996 book, It Takes a Village. In the text, Clinton quotes author Alan Ehrenhalt, who wrote in his book The Lost City: ''The unfettered free market has been the most radically disruptive force in American life in the last generation.'' During a March 1996 interview on the C-SPAN program Book Notes, Clinton said she agreed with the statement. But the word ''disruptive'' is not the same as ''destructive'' in the context of the free market, said Ehrenhalt, executive editor of Governing magazine. The magazine is published by CQ and is an affiliate of the St. Petersburg Times . "There's no particular reason for a controversy," he said. "But Giuliani is looking for anything to say against Hillary Clinton ... and he keeps distorting it." Most economists would agree, Ehrenhalt said, with his assertion that the free market causes interruptions, whether positive or negative, in its normal course — which is the dictionary definition of disruptive. A Giuliani campaign spokesman didn't see a difference between the words. ''No one can deny that Mayor Giuliani was accurate in describing Hillary Clinton's economic philosophy,'' said spokesman Elliot Bundy. Clinton's campaign didn't want to comment on the issue, but her full answer to the C-SPAN question provides more context. ''The market is the driving force behind our prosperity, our freedom ... (but) it cannot be permitted just to run roughshod over people's lives as well,'' she said. Because of Giuliani's misquote, we give this a ruling of False.

pomt-07813	The United states is "borrowing more than 40 cents of every dollar we spend."	true	/virginia/statements/2011/feb/17/scott-rigell/rep-scott-rigell-says-united-states-borrows-more-4/	Federal budget season officially opened on Feb. 14 with the release of President Obama’s spending proposal for the coming fiscal year. Some of the first shots were fired by Virginia Republicans in the House of Representatives, charging Obama is not doing enough to cut spending and sink budget deficits. "We are a nation $14 trillion in debt and are borrowing more than 40 cents of every dollar we spend," said Scott Rigell, who represents Virginia’s Second District, in a press release. Rigell is not the only Republican using that line. We wanted to see if it is true. Crystal Cameron, Rigell’s director of communications, told us the congressman based his statement on the Treasury Department’s monthly report on the government’s income and expenditures. We turned to those summaries and did some math. In fiscal 2010, which ended Sept. 30, 2010, the federal government had revenues of $2.16 trillion. It spent $3.46 trillion. That means the deficit was 37.5 percent of total spending. The Treasury also has information through January of this fiscal year. The U.S. has spent $1.18 trillion while receiving $758.35 billion. That gives us a deficit worth 35.6 percent of spending. Uncle Sam projects the deficit will be of 36.9 percent spending for the entire 2011 fiscal year. So the true figures are a bit below Rigell’s claim that we are covering 40 cents of every dollar spent with debt. But he’s pretty close to the right number. There is, however, a catch. The Treasury Department divides its revenue and spending into two categories: on-budget and off-budget. Matt Anderson, a Treasury spokesman, said off-budget contains Social Security and the Postal Service. The services are not included in budget bills approved because they are expected to be self-supporting, although in recent years Congress has spent money to cover losses at the Postal Service. All other revenues and spending are considered on-budget. A chunk of our payroll taxes go directly into Social Security funds, which are then disbursed to recipients. The money never goes into the larger pool of U.S. revenue, nor do receipts from income taxes, corporate taxes or other forms of federal revenue go towards Social Security payments. The off-budget programs run a surplus. During the 2010 fiscal year they had revenue of $631.69 billion against spending of $554.69 billion. That means the deficit for on-budget programs was 47.3 percent. The full-year estimate for the 2011 fiscal year would put the deficit in on-budget programs at 45.9 percent. We asked Isabel Sawhill, a senior fellow and budget expert at the center-to-left Brookings Institution, to check our figures. She and her research assistant, Alex Gold, confirmed our math. They said "the exact numbers depend on the time period examined, but 40 percent seems to be a reasonable ballpark figure." To get historic perspective, we looked at U.S. budgets from 1930 until 2010. The highest deficits, as a percentage of spending, came in 1943 during World War II, when 69.5 percent of spending was debt financed. In 1985, during when Ronald Reagan was president, the gap was 22.4 percent, and the deficit gap never fell below 11 percent under his watch. In 1995, during the Clinton Administration, the gap was 10.8 percent. The budget would actually enjoy four years of surplus at the end of his tenure, reaching a high point with revenues exceeding spending by 13.2 percent in 2000. In 2005 under George W. Bush, deficit spending accounted for 12.9 percent of outlays. The 2009 budget, passed during Bush’s final months in office and altered when Obama took over, saw spending exceed revenues by 40.2 percent. To review, Rigell said the United States is "borrowing more than 40 cents of every dollar we spend." Under the total budget figures the deficit is actually a bit smaller than that mark, coming in at 37.5 percent in the last fiscal year and a slightly lower number so far this year. But when Social Security and Postal Service funds are excluded, as they are from the annual federal budget, the size of the deficit climbs above 40 percent. By one measure, Rigell slightly over-estimates the percentage of our annual spending that is deficit-based. By another, he slightly under-estimates it. Overall, he’s made an accurate claim. We rate his statement True.	None	Scott Rigell	None	None	None	2011-02-17T10:57:56	2011-02-14	['None']
pomt-09194	"There are 321,092 public school teachers in Texas. And there are 313,850 non-teachers in our public schools."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/may/27/empower-texans/pac-says-texas-public-schools-employ-one-non-teach/	Urging Texans to find out how public schools are spending their money, Michael Quinn Sullivan, president of the conservative-leaning Empower Texans, which advocates for limited government, suggests that maybe too many non-teachers are soaking up taxpayer dollars that could be spent on classroom instruction. "Everyone says public schools in Texas are underfunded, but are they?" Sullivan says in the May 14 Web video, pointing out that more than half of the public school system's funding is spent on expenses outside the classroom. "You might say there's a little overhead." "There are 321,092 public school teachers in Texas. There are 313,850 non-teachers in our public schools," he continues. "Do we really need one non-teacher for every teacher on the public school payroll?" We're not weighing in on the value of non-teachers in the schools, but we wondered if Sullivan got his ratio right. He pointed us to the Texas Education Agency website, which has annual "snapshots" of public education in Texas both statewide and by district. The reports cover 90 statistics including student demographics, average college admission test scores and how many people each district employs broken down by job type. According to the most recent snapshot, 634,942 full-time employees worked in the public education system (not including charter schools) in 2008-09. Of those, 321,092 were full-time teachers and 313,850 staff members held other jobs. Who are all these non-teachers? According to the snapshot, teachers accounted for 51 percent of the schools' workforce in 2008-09. Auxiliary staff — such as security, public information officers and grant writers, according to TEA — were the next biggest grouping, 28 percent, followed by educational, at 10 percent, professional support staff, 8 percent, and administrative staff, 4 percent. This adds to more than 100 percent, the agency said, because some full-time employees divide time between positions. Sullivan said Empower Texans isn't suggesting that "all 'non-teachers' are bad — clearly many are needed," but that the one-to-one teacher to non-teacher ratio "seems a bit high." In the Web ad, Sullivan sounds a critical note, saying: "Hey, we've got bureaucrats to pay. If you think our classrooms are underfunded — and they probably are — the money should be pretty easy to find. Just walk down to your nearest administrative complex." There's a counterpoint. Debbie Ratcliffe, the TEA's communications director, said: "It takes a village to run a school district." "There naturally are going to be a lot of people on school payrolls that aren't teachers," Ratcliffe said. "Just think of the number of bus drivers and custodians and all those kinds of folks. Could you make a school run without them? Yeah, but it sure is a lot harder." Ratcliffe shared a more recent "standard report" that breaks down the full-time school employees for 2009-10 in detail. As of March 2010, the report says, statewide school district personnel totaled 661,285. Teachers made up about half of that, accounting for 333,090 full-time staff. Almost all the employees that fall under teaching staff are pre-kindergarten through 12th grade teachers. About 400 are labeled "not applicable," which Ratcliffe said includes tutors and study hall monitors. The 2010 count puts the number of administrative staff at 25,525, or 3.9 percent of all workers. So who are the other 302,670 employees — the bulk of the "non-teachers" in Sullivan's claim? About 5,136 are librarians, 11,082 are counselors, 5,916 are nurses and 3,924 are speech therapists, among others. Some 178,140 are classified as auxiliary staff, a category that includes security personnel, public information officers and grant writers. How does Texas stack up nationally? On par, according to the the National Center for Education Statistics' most recent data. In 2007, teachers accounted for 51 percent of all elementary and secondary public school employees. In 20 states, teachers accounted for less than 50 percent of total staff, including Virgina (35 percent). In 30 states, teachers made up 50 percent or more of all staff, including South Carolina (72 percent). According to another report, released in November, instructional aides accounted for about 12 percent of all full-time public school staff nationwide, instructional coordinators and supervisors made up 1 percent, guidance counselors (2 percent), librarians (1 percent), student and support staff (23 percent), school administrators (3 percent), school district administrators (1 percent) and administrative support staff (7 percent). Where does all this leave Sullivan's statement? He correctly cites the number of teachers and non-teachers, per the education agency's latest snapshot report. More recent data available from the agency shows both have increased; still, the ratio of teachers to non-teachers is about the same. But Sullivan's online call to action doesn't do justice to the state's actual mix of school workers. The majority of non-teachers aren't administrators or paper shufflers; they're people who work directly with students including counselors, librarians, therapists and bus drivers. We rate Sullivan's statement as Mostly True. This story was updated to correct the total number of public school employees to 634,942.

pomt-08020	"In my 12 years in the House, I have watched my district go from a solidly Democratic district to a heavily solid Republican district."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/jan/10/allan-ritter/party-switching-legislator-allan-ritter-says-his-d/	Democrat-turned-Republican state Rep. Allan Ritter told reporters last month that the district he represents once was true blue, but it’s now dead red. Ritter was less, uh, poetical at a Dec. 14 Austin press conference confirming his switch, which helped Republicans edge toward the 101-vote Texas House super-majority they’ll have when the 2011 legislative session starts Tuesday. "In my 12 years in the House, I have watched my district go from a solidly Democratic district to a heavily Republican district," the Nederland resident said of House District 21, which takes in a portion of Beaumont and extends through southwestern Jefferson County. His comment appeared in a Dec. 15 Dallas Morning News article. Did most voters in Ritter’s district shift right in that time? To gauge election returns, we contacted the Texas Legislative Council, which provided results of various general-election races for Ritter’s district from 1994, four years before he first won his seat, through 2008; analyst Clare Dyer told us the council has yet to analyze 2010 results within the district. We also asked Jefferson County for breakdowns of district results. What we found is that Republicans running statewide were strong vote-getters prior to Ritter’s election, a sign the Dems’ grip on the district was already loosening. Still, Democrats continued to win a share of down-ballot races, though that pattern has faded. Also notable: Jefferson County, historically pro-union, pro-Democratic territory, saw numerous down-ballot races in which the GOP offered no nominees. Also, the district’s configuration changed slightly in redistricting after the 2000 census. We scrutinized district results based on boundaries in place at the time of each election. Some particulars: +In November 1994, seven Republicans running statewide carried the district, topped by U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison with 61 percent. But seven Democratic statewide hopefuls also prevailed, led by Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock at 65 percent. +In 1998, Ritter drew 53 percent of the district’s vote, while Democratic state Sen. David Bernsen of Beaumont won 61 percent; U.S. Rep. Nick Lampson fared the best of Democrats in races analyzed by the council, gathering 68 percent. No Democrats won statewide office that year, but five nominees carried HD 21 including two judicial choices and Jim Mattox (for attorney general), 54 percent; John Sharp (lieutenant governor), 53 percent; and Paul Hobby (state comptroller), 52 percent. Eight Republican hopefuls including four judicial nominees won the district, topped by Gov. George W. Bush, at 68 percent. According to Jefferson County, a Democrat carried part of HD 21 in 1998 for a county commissioner’s seat, while a Republican seeking another commissioner seat carried a different part. Among HD 21 voters, Republican Jimmy D. "Skip" Hulett bested his Democratic opponent for a district court judgeship, though Hulett lost his race over all. +In 2000, Ritter won 57 percent of the district vote, compared to Lampson’s 63 percent. Republican U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison got 66 percent with Bush, the GOP presidential nominee, drawing 62 percent. +In 2002, Ritter romped with 70 percent as Lampson garnered 66 percent in the district. However, every Republican running statewide--with the leading vote-getter being State Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander, 64 percent--carried the district. From 2004 through 2010, Ritter ran unopposed in November elections as Republicans running for state and federal office enjoyed continued gains: +In 2004, Bush won 63 percent in the district as Democrat Lampson got 59 percent though he lost his seat to a Republican challenger in a district that had been redrawn by the GOP-majority 2003 Legislature. +In 2006, every Republican running statewide carried the district, led by Hutchison, who drew 65 percent. At the bottom of the statewide slate was Perry, who got 45 percent of the district vote versus three major foes. Down-ballot, the Democratic nominees for Jefferson County judge, Ronald Walker, and the 279th state district judgeship, Randy Shelton, drew 52 and 51 percent, respectively. +In 2008, Republican presidential nominee John McCain drew 66 percent of the vote, while Cornyn carried 64 percent, compared to 55 percent statewide for both. In contested statewide races, no Republican carried less than 56 percent of the district vote. +In November 2010, Republicans beat Democrats in the district for three Texas Supreme Court seats, a seat on the state’s highest criminal court, the Court of Criminal Appeals, and a spot on the Ninth Court of Appeals. Down ballot, Republican hopefuls for county treasurer and tax assessor-collector trounced their Democratic foes--also prevailing countywide in the historically Democratic bastion. To our queries, partisan consultants Mike Baselice and Ed Martin said the district leans Republican, but Martin, a Democratic strategist, said it hasn't changed as much as Ritter claims. Baselice, a GOP pollster, stressed numbers that he said demonstrate the district shifting 10 percentage points over 10 years. In 1998, the base Republican vote in the district was 47 percent, he said, a figure based on entwining the results of races for lieutenant governor and state comptroller (and ignoring third-party votes). In 2008, the base GOP vote was 57 percent, based on the results in one race for the Texas Supreme Court. In an interview, Ritter told us voter perceptions have swung. "I can’t say that a Democrat, the right candidate, cannot win in the district... My point is that the overall view and philosophical view and the comfortability of the voters, they are leaning heavy conservative and Republican. I can tell you, just from the reaction we’ve been getting locally that’s overwhelmingly supportive of (my switch), I know this is the right move." Finally, Bruce Drury, a retired Lamar University professor of political scientist, cautioned against basing conclusions about the district’s tilt on the latest elections, which were widely viewed as a referendum on national affairs and the Democratic leadership in Washington. Drury said: "If the Republicans screw up Congress and (the) 2012 (election) becomes a plebiscite on that and (President Barack) Obama appears to be successful, then Allan Ritter could well be in trouble." Our sense? Republicans running statewide had an edge in Ritter’s district before his first election and that advantage expanded in subsequent elections as Democrats became less successful. During the 12 years, though, Democrats still pulled off some wins, while a few candidates (like Ritter) managed not to stir up GOP challengers. Whether such free rides will continue is uncertain. Rittter exaggerates how "solidly Democratic" his district was; he’s closer to the mark on how Republican it became. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-05244	"We came out against Deepwater and everybody is now paying for [the project] in their electric bills."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jun/03/lisa-blais/tea-party-leader-lisa-blais-says-rhode-island-cons/	The controversy over Rhode Island's decision to guarantee $75 million in loans to 38 Studios to develop video games has raised questions about the government's role in promoting various businesses. When Lisa Blais, a member of the board of directors of Ocean State Tea Party In Action, was asked about the deal on the May 21 edition of WHJJ's "Helen Glover Show," she brought up the state's support of the Deepwater Wind project, which is planning to build wind turbines in the waters off Block Island. "As you know, we came out against Deepwater," Blais said. "And everybody is now paying for it in their electric bills." With the Rhode Island economy in such bad shape and many residents facing financial problems, "who can afford these extra surcharges on our electric bill," she asked, calling the Deepwater project another example of "crony capitalism." Her claim caught our attention because Deepwater is still in the planning stages, years away from completion. We wondered: Are Rhode Islanders really paying for a project that hasn’t been built? Before we answer that question, here’s some background. In 2004, the General Assembly passed a law requiring National Grid -- the company that provides electricity and gas to Rhode Island -- to start buying electricity generated from renewable sources, such as wind and solar, even though such sources cost more. In 2007, when the law took effect, the amount was 3 percent of the power the company purchased, rising incrementally each year. It is now at 6.5 percent, according to David Graves, spokesman for National Grid. In 2009, the legislature and Gov. Donald Carcieri modified that law, requiring National Grid to actively encourage renewable energy projects; one of them was to be an undersea power line from Block Island to the mainland. The line would be used to feed cheaper power to the island (currently the island relies on diesel generators for its power). Ultimately, the line would feed excess electricity from the Deepwater turbines to the mainland when the wind is blowing. In the first phase, there would be five turbines. In the second phase, up to 200 more would be built in federal waters. National Grid has racked up some legal costs dealing with that power line and those costs are being passed on to consumers as part of a 0.007 cents per kilowatt hour surcharge on their bills. For the typical residential customer -- who uses about 500 kilowatts per month -- that surcharge translates to no more than 3.5 cents per month. The real cost is going to come when National Grid has to buy the power Deepwater generates. Initially, National Grid and Deepwater agreed that National Grid would pay no more than 24.4 cents per kilowatt hour for that energy -- but that was still more than two and a half times the cost of buying energy from conventional sources at the time. However, that price would automatically increase by 3.5 percent per year over the next 20 years. The state Public Utilities Commission overruled the deal on March 30, 2010, saying the price was not "commercially reasonable" for Grid's customers. Carcieri and legislative leaders reacted by passing a law requiring the PUC to rehear the case using different rules and a shortened timetable. It also redefined what was "commercially reasonable" and declared that Deepwater's initial Block Island project was "in the public interest." Critics said the changes gave the PUC no choice but to approve the agreement, even though the project was expected to result in consumers paying $409 million to $415 million extra for their power while getting economic benefits worth $129 million (as calculated by the state Economic Development Commission) and the creation of just six permanent jobs. The PUC approved the agreement by a 2-1 vote on Aug. 11, 2010. How much extra will the power from Deepwater Wind ultimately cost consumers? On an individual basis, Graves said, the best estimate in 2009 was that the typical residential bill would rise by $1.37 per month. The actual amount will depend on prices at the time. To put that number in context, the bill for the average customer is currently $78 a month. But the costs will show up in other ways as well, as businesses struggle with more-expensive electricity, an effect that will ripple through the Rhode Island economy. Benefits, such as cleaner energy, are even harder to quantify. Our ruling Lisa Blais of the Ocean State Tea Party In Action said that, in the wake of the state's approval of the Deepwater Wind project, "everybody is now paying for it in their electric bills." When we asked for the source of her information, she said she remembered it from the debate over Deepwater, but said she should have referred to the extra cost as something consumers will be facing. "I would have been more precise if I said now 'we face' paying for it, which was the tenor of my comments on Glover's show," she said. If the Deepwater Wind project becomes operational and if prices for purchasing electricity don't change significantly, Blais' statement could become true. But most radio listeners would have heard what we did: that we're paying for the project now. In the strictest sense, we're paying less than 3.5 cents a month for some incidental National Grid expenses connected with the project. That's enough to avoid a False on the Truth-O-Meter, but not enough juice to move the needle very far. We rate her statement Mostly False. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-11944	"President Trump signs executive order stripping NFL of ‘non-profit’ status."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/oct/10/blog-posting/donald-trump-did-not-kill-nfls-tax-exempt-status-e/	A news story that asserts President Donald Trump’s feud with the National Football League led him to revoke the organization’s nonprofit tax status is a trick play created by a fake news website. The headline on an Oct. 9, 2017, post on ConservativePaper.com read, "President Trump signs executive order stripping NFL of ‘non-profit’ status." Facebook users flagged the content as possibly being bogus, as part of the social network’s efforts to curb fake news stories. The same story appeared on several other websites reported by Facebook users. The story, which is fake, said Trump on Oct. 8 had revoked the NFL’s "401(c)(3) status ‘until it is clear that players and team owners respect their country.’ " (There is no such thing as tax-exempt 401(c)(3) classification in the tax code.) This was a response to players protesting racial inequity by kneeling during the Star-Spangled Banner, which has raised Trump’s hackles in recent weeks. Now, it may surprise some to know that the NFL’s league office did have tax-exempt status as a 501(c)(6) nonprofit — a tax classification for business leagues, chambers of commerce, real estate and trade boards and yes, professional football leagues. The change in the tax code was granted in 1966, to allow the NFL and AFL to merge without the threat of violating anti-trust laws. The league office essentially acts as a trade organization for the individual teams, which are what make most of the league’s profits, which are taxed. This is different than 501(c)(3) status, which is for charitable organizations. But the league voluntarily gave up its tax-exempt status in 2015 after being criticized by politicians who thought the entire league was avoiding taxes. "As you know, the effects of the tax-exempt status of the league office have been mischaracterized repeatedly in recent years," NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in the letter to team owners that year. "The fact is that the business of the NFL has never been tax-exempt." U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., revived the subject on Sept. 26 when he became lead sponsor of the Pro Sports Act, looking to make the voluntary status change permanent by changing the tax code. Trump also brought up the issue on Oct. 10, when he tweeted, "Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country? Change tax law!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com But he didn’t sign any executive order rescinding the league’s tax status, which it had voluntarily changed already. The fake story appeared to originate two days before Trump’s tweet, in an Oct. 8 post on FreedomJunkshun.com, which looks to be member of a series of fake websites associated with Christopher Blair, a self-described liberal troll who creates fictional stories to try to fool conservative readers. FreedomJunkshun.com uses the same website architecture as other Blair-affiliated sites, and carries a disclaimer that reads, "All people, places, names and images should be considered fictitious or fictitious representations." After further review, our ruling on the story stands: Pants On Fire! See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2017-10-10T17:27:16	2017-10-09	['None']
pomt-02758	"In every poll," John Cornyn "always loses to any conservative the voters have heard about."	false	/texas/statements/2013/dec/13/steve-stockman/polls-showed-rick-perry-or-ron-paul-ahead-john-cor/	The congressman challenging two-term U.S. Sen. John Cornyn in the 2014 Republican primary says Cornyn is vulnerable from the right. In a Dec. 10, 2013, blog post on his campaign website, Steve Stockman of Friendswood specified: "In every poll liberal John Cornyn always loses to any conservative the voters have heard about." Calling Cornyn liberal is questionable, though we see that as Stockman’s opinion and not something that we could put to the Texas Truth-O-Meter. Suffice to say that Cornyn came out as the Senate’s second-least liberal and second-most conservative member in a February 2013 vote analysis by National Journal magazine. We turned instead to whether every poll shows Cornyn losing re-election to "any conservative the voters have heard about." Voter polls Unfortunately, we failed to hear back from Stockman as we weighed the results of three fall 2013 voter polls testing Cornyn for re-election against particular possible Republican foes. An October 2013 poll by the University of Texas and Texas Tribune showed Cornyn leading at 39 percent against two little-known opponents, Dwayne Stovall and Erick Wyatt. Forty-eight percent of respondents had no opinion. On Nov. 14, 2013, UT government lecturer Jim Henson, one of the pollsters, wrote for the Tribune that this was "by no means a forceful showing for an incumbent senator in a state as red as Texas, and has further fueled whispers of a primary challenge." Elaborating by email, Henson told us Cornyn saw his voter favorability ratings among Texas conservatives drop through the summer, "which helped fuel further talk of a challenge from the right." Neither Stovall or Wyatt was widely known when the poll was taken, Henson said. Per Stockmn’s focus on Republicans Texans had "heard about," Henson offered: "I think it would roughly be fair to say that anyone who has previously run statewide or nationally, or has in some other way been the subject of media exposure, could be referred to as someone people have ‘heard about.’" Two polls to go. In early November 2013, a survey taken by North Carolina-based Public Policy Polling indicated Cornyn was not the favorite of 388 past Republican primary voters, who by 49 percent to 33 percent indicated they would prefer a more conservative nominee. That poll also showed Cornyn ahead in hypothetical one-on-one faceoffs with two party figures and trailing another hypothetical challenger. According to a Nov. 6, 2013, press release on the results, Cornyn ran ahead of Biblical historian David Barton, former vice chairman of the Republican Party of Texas, by 51 percent to 18 percent, and led U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Tyler, by 40 percent to 31 percent. The poll also asked about a hypothetical matchup between Cornyn and Gov. Rick Perry. The result: Perry drew 46 percent to Cornyn’s 35 percent. (Perry, of course, is not challenging Cornyn and has, in fact, endorsed him.) By email, PPP spokesman Tom Jensen noted that 38 percent of the polled voters had an opinion of Gohmert. Jensen said the firm did not poll on Barton’s name recognition, "but it doubtless would have been lower." Jensen wrote: "My bar of whether voters have heard about a candidate would be whether they have 50% name recognition," meaning half or more of the voters recognize the candidate’s name. "Perry was the only one we tested who fit that bill. So Stockman’s statement might be true at some level but it’s not particularly compelling since there really just wasn’t much polling out there testing Cornyn against anyone who voters are very familiar with." Next, Jensen pointed us to an Oct. 26, 2013, poll by Human Events and Florida-based Gravis Marketing indicating that a generic "Tea Party" candidate, unnamed, would lead Cornyn among Republicans by 46 percent to 33 percent, according to a Gravis Marketing summary. The poll involved 563 Republicans, the firm said, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. According to the summary, Cornyn led several hypothetical one-on-one races--including versus Stockman. The summary says Cornyn led Gohmert in its polls by 45 percent to 20 percent and ran ahead of Stockman, 41 percent to 15 percent. But Cornyn trailed in a one-on-one matchup with U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, who has run for president several times, 44 percent to 34 percent, the summary states. We wondered about a seeming conflict in the Gravis results: Cornyn outpacing Rafael Cruz, whose son, Ted, is the junior senator from Texas, by 39 percent to 33 percent, in their hypothetical one-on-one matchup yet in a later poll result, the elder Cruz leading Cornyn, Paul and Stockman in a hypothetical four-way primary. The latter question was: "If the Republican primary were held today, would you vote for Cornyn, Cruz, Paul or Stockman?" The results: Cruz, 41 percent, Cornyn at 25 percent, Paul at 18 percent and Stockman at 3 percent. By telephone, the president of Gravis Marketing, Doug Kaplan, told us he suspects some poll respondents answering the four-way question thought they were considering a Ted Cruz candidacy against Cornyn rather than a race involving his father, with the erroneous effect being a boost to the elder Cruz’s poll standing. "I’m not confident with the way we worded that question," Kaplan said. Cornyn’s objection To our inquiry, Cornyn’s Senate campaign disputed Stockman’s website statement. By email, Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie pointed out that no one leading Cornyn in the three polls was shown as attracting more than half the vote--in other words, winning the nomination outright. On another front, Brandewie maintained that Texas Republicans have "heard about" the two candidates bested by Cornyn in the UT/Tribune poll as well as Barton, Gohmert and the elder Cruz, each of whom did not lead Cornyn in the polled one-on-one matchups. Our ruling Stockman said: "In every poll," John Cornyn "always loses to any conservative the voters have heard about." In Stockman's favor, recent polling suggests Cornyn trailing Perry and Paul, two well-known Republicans, in hypothetical one-on-one matches. But polls also have shown Cornyn running ahead of Barton, Gohmert and Stockman. These Texans are almost certainly less known than Paul and Perry, both of whom ran for president. Yet Gohmert and Stockman are members of Congress and Barton has long been a grass-roots leader. We think it reasonable to consider each one a conservative that "voters have heard about," which makes Stockman’s statement False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-14767	Barack Obama’s Columbia University ID says he was a foreign student and went by "Barry Soetoro."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/09/facebook-posts/facebook-posts-still-claim-obama-wasnt-born-us/	President Barack Obama is about to enter his eighth and final year in the Oval Office, but some people are still trying to say he was never eligible for that job in the first place. Other conspiracy theories focus on Obama’s birth certificate (which isn’t a fake). This one uses his, ahem, totally real college ID to make the case that Obama was foreign-born. A reader recently asked us via snail mail to look into a post he saw on Facebook showing the purported Columbia University student ID of Barry Soetoro — aka Barack Obama. The ID lists Soetoro as a foreign student. This image has been around for a few years now. Here’s a 2013 post from "Tea Party United." Other Internet debunkers have looked at this before (Snopes, for one), but we wanted to take our own look. It may not surprise you that it’s a sham. Sorting out Soetoro There was a time when Obama used the last name "Soetoro." Obama used Soetoro, the last name of his stepfather, while he was growing up in Indonesia. At age 10, Obama moved back to Hawaii, his birthplace, and stopped using that last name. After two years at Occidental College in California, 20-year-old Barack Obama transferred to Columbia University in New York in 1981. There are no records that suggest Obama ever went by his childhood alias while attending Columbia. In 1983, the university’s weekly magazine published an essay written by Obama. The byline reads "Barack Obama." ID issues Whoever took the time to make this image apparently didn’t take the extra time to change the number on the card. After the card made the initial rounds, Snopes revealed the card number belonged to another student, who appears to be caught up in this simply because he posted his card to the web in 1998. The picture of Obama on the fake ID is definitely not of the president as a young college student. It looks like the photo was taken in 1999, when Obama was in his late 30s and a state senator in Illinois. What’s more convincing is Columbia University didn’t even start using digital ID cards until 1996 — 13 years after Obama graduated. "This is a fake," said Robert Hornsby, a spokesman for the university, to PolitiFact. "We didn't even have such IDs then." Finally, Obama’s ID would not have said "foreign student," and not just because Obama was born in Hawaii. Hornsby said Columbia doesn’t even label student IDs like that. Our ruling A Facebook post makes ridiculous claims about a Columbia University ID that shows Obama was a foreign student who went by the alias "Barry Soetoro." The post wants you to believe Obama isn’t really an American citizen. But the ID, and the birther narrative behind it, is not valid. Obama stopped using his stepfather’s last name when he was 10. Columbia University didn’t even start using these types of IDs until the mid 1990s, long after Obama graduated. The ID is a pretty bad Photoshop job. We rate the claim Pants on Fire! Editor's note: This article has been updated to correct the name of Columbia University spokesman Robert Hornsby.	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2015-12-09T15:46:04	2013-11-13	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-01833	David Perdue "has never voted in a Republican primary until his name was on the ballot."	false	/georgia/statements/2014/jul/18/jack-kingston/record-doesnt-support-kingston-claim-against-perdu/	In a new campaign flier, U.S. Senate candidate David Perdue is shown holding up a sign that says: "I don’t vote but I want yours." "Perdue has never voted in a Republican primary until his name was on the ballot," the flier states. "It’s clear he only votes for one thing: himself." Perdue, a wealthy businessman from Sea Island, and Jack Kingston, a veteran U.S. House member from Savannah, are battling to be the Republican nominee to succeed retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss. Turnout is expected to be light for their runoff Tuesday. And Kingston and Perdue know the outcome could hinge on their ability to persuade their supporters and the party faithful to return to the polls. Kingston’s campaign is suggesting Perdue’s not a true Republican, a charge Perdue’s campaign vehemently denies. The flier is eye-catching. But is this statement accurate? "Perdue has never voted in a Republican primary until his name was on the ballot." PolitiFact is on the case. We began by asking Chris Crawford, Kingston’s campaign spokesman, for proof. Crawford sent us Perdue’s voting records from Massachusetts, Texas, Tennessee and Georgia, places the former CEO of Dollar General has lived since 1994. The records, which we independently verified, show Perdue voted at least nine times in 20 years, including in the Republican presidential preference primaries of 2008 (in Tennessee) and 2012 (in Georgia). He voted by absentee ballot in this year’s May 20 general election primary, when he, Kingston and five others were on the GOP ballot for the U.S. Senate. Derrick Dickey, Perdue’s campaign spokesman, said "it’s a ridiculous assertion" to suggest Perdue isn’t "really a Republican." "Not only has David voted in Republican primaries for president, but David has also given over $65,000 to Republican candidates and causes in the past decade and raised thousands more to help elect fellow Republicans," Dickey said in an email. The Kingston campaign flier shows Perdue in a party hat and says: "David Perdue celebrating a lifetime of doing nothing for Republicans." It states that while the GOP was "busy fighting against the Democrats, Perdue was funding them." It also calls Perdue out for making a "big campaign contribution to an extreme Liberal Democrat from Massachusetts" who is not identified in the flier. Kingston isn’t the first Georgia candidate to use an opponent’s personal voting record to suggest that he or she is a party Johnny-come-lately. In 2010, Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp accused GOP rival Doug MacGinnitie of failing to vote in Republican primaries for two decades. MacGinnitie countered with a commercial saying Kemp’s record showed he voted for Democrats. Kemp won the election, and Republican Gov. Nathan Deal went on to appoint MacGinnitie as state revenue commissioner. The argument can be made that, in some areas, where one party dominates, the primary can effectively decide an election. Larry Sabato, the director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said polls show Kingston and Perdue in a relatively close runoff. "So potentially anything that can move even a few thousand votes could be decisive," Sabato said. "To most people, the topics of these Kingston ads might seem to be small potatoes, and in some sense, they are," he said. "But you have to look at the specialized, concentrated electorate for a runoff." Voters who go to the polls for party primaries and runoffs are generally "the most loyal, active party members," Sabato said. "They are precisely the ones who might be most concerned about the candidates’ past party loyalty, nonvoting record and political contributions." Kerwin Swint, a political science professor at Kennesaw State University, said he doesn’t believe any direct-mail piece or online ad would be a game-changer at this point in the race, "unless it was something new and jaw-dropping, and coordinated with TV and radio spots." "The charge that Perdue has not voted in GOP primaries is not new. Voters have heard it before," Swint said. "It's also not terribly surprising for business people who are relatively new to politics to have a thin voting record." He said voters might be more concerned about the donation to the "liberal Democrat" who the Kingston camp told PolitiFact was the late U.S. Rep. Joe Moakley. Kingston’s camp furnished records showing that Perdue, while vice president of Reebok, donated $500 to Moakley’s re-election campaign in 2000. Other records show that Perdue also donated to some well-known Republicans, including Lamar Alexander and Mitt Romney. To sum up, the Kingston camp, trying to convince voters that Perdue isn’t a real Republican, has sent out a flier that states: David Perdue "has never voted in a Republican primary until his name was on the ballot." Public records show Perdue didn’t vote in a general election primary until this year, when he’s a candidate for U.S. Senate. But those same records show Perdue voted Republican in the presidential primaries in 2008 and 2012. That makes the "never voted in a Republican primary" claim flat out wrong. We rate the Kingston statement as False.	None	Jack Kingston	None	None	None	2014-07-18T00:00:00	2014-07-08	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-01852	Says 70 percent of Virginia’s Medicaid cost is for seniors in nursing homes.	false	/virginia/statements/2014/jul/14/mark-sickles/sickles-says-70-percent-virginias-medicaid-cost-se/	Del. Mark Sickles, D-Fairfax, says increased demand for nursing home care is a major reason why the Virginia’s Medicaid costs have soared. "We’re living longer than ever and you have to spend down until you get to $2,000 of assets before you qualify for (Medicaid funded) nursing home care in our state," Sickles said in a recent floor speech. "$2,000. That’s where the money goes. That’s where 70 percent of the money goes in our Medicaid program – to help our seniors live with skilled nursing who need it." Let’s start by noting that Sickles is correct is saying that Virginia’s Medicaid will only pay for nursing home care to elderly and disabled people whose total financial resources don’t exceed $2,000. What we want to explore in this Truth-O-Meter is Sickle’s claim that 70 percent of the state’s Medicaid money goes to provide elderly care in nursing homes. The statement comes amid a partisan battle over whether expand Medicaid to up to 400,000 additional low-income Virginians. Under Obamacare, the federal government would always pay at least 90 percent of the tab. The GOP-led General Assembly blocked the expansion last month, saying Washington can’t be trusted to pay its promised shares. Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, is exploring whether he can broaden the program without legislators’ consent. Sickles told us he can’t recall the exact source of his nursing home claim but, as a long time member of the Health, Welfare and Institutions Committee, he’s often heard that 70 percent of the Medicaid money goes to 30 percent of the recipients. He said he understood that trend was "largely caused" by seniors in nursing homes. But Craig Markva, a spokesman for the Department of Medical Assistance Services, which runs the state’s Medicaid program, gave us a different explanation. He said 70 percent of the money is spent on the medical expenses of all elderly and disabled patients, who comprise 32 percent of Virginia’s Medicaid recipients. Markva sent us Medicaid statistics for the budget year that ended June 30, 2013 -- the latest numbers available. They show that of the slightly more than 1 million Medicaid enrollees in Virginia, only 22,513 -- or 2.2 percent -- were seniors in nursing facilities. Out of a $6.7 billion Medicaid budget that fiscal year, the state spent $648 million to care for seniors in nursing homes. That boils down to 9.7 percent of the money. All told, seniors accounted for about 7 percent of Virginia’s Medicaid recipients during the 2012-13 budget year and received about 17 percent of the funds, or slightly more than $1.1 billion. Our ruling Sickles said that 70 percent of the state’s Medicaid spending goes to seniors in nursing homes. He’s way off; only 9.7 percent of the money goes to that cause. We rate his statement False.

pomt-13274	"Cancer and matters to do with kidney failure kill more people in Kenya today than malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS combined."	false	/global-news/statements/2016/oct/13/william-ruto/lack-basic-death-data-leads-false-claims-kenya/	At the launch of a new political party at a sports stadium in Nairobi, Kenya, the country’s deputy president William Ruto talked about a disease that Vice President Joe Biden has made his life’s mission. At the start of the year, following the death of Biden’s son to brain cancer, the vice president took the lead in the administration’s Cancer Moonshot project, an effort to rapidly accelerate cancer research. Ruto cast cancer as a top public health priority for his country. "Cancer and matters to do with kidney failure kill more people in Kenya today than malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS combined," Ruto said Sept. 9, 2016. Given that AIDS is the No. 1 killer in sub-Saharan Africa, and malaria ranks fourth, our Africa Check partners decided to check Ruto’s numbers. He is wrong. For the record, Ruto’s office did not provide any supporting data. A dearth of numbers Solid data is sorely lacking in Kenya as it is in most sub-Saharan African nations. But the numbers that are available disprove Ruto’s claim. Kenya just launched a national cancer registry, but it won’t be fully in place until 2019. For the time being, the highest estimate puts the number of cancer deaths at 28,000 in 2015. On kidney disease, Kenya has no national data at all. The World Health Organization estimates 3,100 deaths for 2014. Combined that’s a rough count of 31,100 deaths. WHO is the most reliable source for tuberculosis death estimates in Kenya as well, with about 9,400 deaths in 2014. The United Nations AIDS program relies on statistical models to derive the number of AIDS deaths in Kenya. UNAIDS says it is "logistically impossible and ethically problematic" to investigate all deaths. According to its statistical model, there were between 28,000 and 50,000 deaths due to AIDS in Kenya in 2014, with 38,000 being the most likely figure. For malaria, the WHO said in its World Malaria Report for 2015 that it was unable to collect data for six East African countries, including Kenya, between 2000 and 2014 because of "inconsistent reporting, or changes in health service accessibility or diagnostic testing". The best we could find for malaria deaths was Kenya’s civil registration data, which provisionally shows 23,789 deaths in 2013 and 20,691in 2015. As you can see, while the numbers are far from perfect, they do not support Ruto’s point. This table pulls the numbers together. Even using the lowest estimates for AIDS and malaria deaths, the combined toll is greater than for cancer and kidney disease. Cancer/Kidney deaths AIDS/Malaria/TB deaths Cancer 28,000 Kidney disease 3,100 AIDS 28,000 Malaria 20,691 TB 9,400 Totals 31,100 58,091 There are efforts such as the Health Data Collaborative and the African Health Initiative that aim to beef up the health data collected in sub-Saharan Africa. But it will be a tough slog. Robert Black at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health helps oversee the data coordination program at the African Health Initiative and he told us it will take many years before these countries have robust systems. "The funding that is available for this from both national and donor funds is grossly inadequate to reach that objective in the near term," Black said. In May 2016, Kenya became the first African country to launch a national effort to ramp up its systems for collecting health data. One of the top priorities? Making sure that every death and cause of death is recorded. Our ruling Ruto said that cancer and kidney disease "kill more people in Kenya today than malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS combined." The precision of the numbers leaves a lot to be desired, but based on the best estimates, Ruto isn’t even close. Using conservative estimates, deaths from AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis are double those from cancer and kidney disease.

pomt-09625	Says he "brought 1,200 jobs to Texas by moving his factories here from China."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/jan/12/farouk-shami/shami-claims-hes-created-1200-jobs-texas-moving-hi/	Hair-care mogul Farouk Shami of Houston thinks "Made in the U.S.A. is the strongest brand in the world," and by promising to create new jobs, he's hoping to win the governorship. As a head-start, "he just brought 1,200 jobs to Texas by moving his factories here from China," according to his Nov. 23 TV ad. We decided to follow-up on one of his biggest talking points. The Palestinian-born businessman, seeking the Democratic nomination in the March 2 primary, has created a $1 billion manufacturing company that makes CHI hair irons and BioSilk shampoo, among hair products. Shami cut the ribbon on his new Houston facility CHI USA in late July 2009. Earlier that month, he announced he was moving to Houston overseas production of his hand-held products, like hair irons, and in the process bringing more than 1,000 jobs to that city. But contrary to his ad, those jobs were created as a result of moving production from South Korea, not China, campaign director and senior strategist Vince Leibowitz said. "That was a miscommunication within our campaign over where those jobs were cut, and unfortunately we got the incorrect information to the talented people who put together our television ad," Leibowitz said. Democratic media firm Devine Mulvey produced the spot. As of Jan. 11, the campaign had changed its commercial to mention only the shift of jobs from Korea. The change happened after our inquiry. Still, on the same day we found the incorrect China reference in a video of the ad (shown to the right) on Shami's Web site, and on the site's homepage. Elizabeth Yong, public relations manager for Houston-based Farouk Systems Group, said CHI USA produces "five to 10" of a total 61 hair care tools, including the original flat iron.Yong said bringing all production stateside will take two years, though "more than 1,000" jobs have already been shifted. Last July, the company said it hopes to shift 4,000 jobs to Texas by 2012, starting with the move of 1,000 jobs from South Korea and China. Leibowitz said that some jobs have been created as a result of relocating production from China, but not the ones advertised as part of Shami's campaign. Perhaps Shami deserves a back slap for admitting his mistake and reworking his ad. Still, incorrect information was left online. We rule his claim Half True.

pomt-13545	"Parents and teachers are already worrying about what they call the ‘Trump Effect.’ They report that bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools, especially targeting students of color, Muslims and immigrants."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/26/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-citing-trump-effect-says-teachers-/	Americans should be concerned about the effect of Donald Trump’s campaign on kids, said Hillary Clinton in an Aug. 25 speech decrying what she sees as her opponent’s campaign of "prejudice and paranoia." She told the story about a high school basketball game in Indiana, where home team fans taunted players from their heavily Hispanic rival school by holding up a large cutout of Trump’s head and chanting "build a wall." "Next time you see Trump rant on television, think about all the children listening across America," Clinton said. "Kids hear a lot more than we think. Parents and teachers are already worrying about what they call the ‘Trump Effect.’ They report that bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools, especially targeting students of color, Muslims, and immigrants." We wondered if Clinton is right teachers are reporting an increase in bullying and harassment and if so, what does it have to do with Trump? Clinton’s source is an April report out of the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights and antidiscrimination advocacy group. The report is titled "The Trump Effect: The impact of the presidential campaign on our nation’s schools." The center conducted an online survey of approximately 2,000 K-12 teachers and found: "Teachers have noted an increase in bullying, harassment and intimidation of students whose races, religions or nationalities have been the verbal targets of candidates on the campaign trail." While their findings correspond directly with Clinton’s claim, it’s important to note that this was not a scientific survey, as the report notes. The respondents don’t represent a random sample of teachers, and it’s likely that those who chose to respond to the survey are those who are most concerned about the campaign’s impact on students. This means it would be inaccurate to extrapolate from the survey that bullying and harassment are generally on the rise across the country. Rather, it is more a collection of teachers’ anecdotal experiences. We looked for a scientific study that speaks to this same question but couldn’t find one, mostly because there tends to be a lag in this kind of data, meaning data on bullying trends in 2016 won’t get published until 2017 or later. The process of setting up and getting approval to conduct a scientific study is lengthy and cumbersome, and would not be approved before the election, said Sheri Bauman, a professor at the University of Arizona who researches bullying. Even so, Bauman said the Southern Poverty Law Center’s report should not be dismissed, as its data show important recurring themes. Here are some interesting details from the survey. Keep in mind that the survey did not mention any candidate names whatsoever: Respondents gave a total of 5,000 comments. Of those, one in five mentioned Trump. All other candidates were mentioned fewer than 200 times combined. "More than one-third have observed an increase in anti-Muslim or anti-immigrant sentiment." "Teachers report that students have been ‘emboldened’ to use slurs, engage in name-calling and make inflammatory statements toward each other," and "Kids use the names of candidates as pejoratives to taunt each other." "More than two-thirds of the teachers reported that students — mainly immigrants, children of immigrants and Muslims — have expressed concerns or fears about what might happen to them or their families after the election." On the otherhand, the bullying can be contrary to the depiction that Clinton offered. The survey also noted examples of students getting bullied by others because they or their parents support Trump. The findings support Clinton’s claim, said Maureen Costello, the report’s author and director of the center’s Teaching Tolerance project. "It’s fair to say the reports say teachers who respond to us are in fact seeing an increase in the quantity of harassment and change in quality of bullying," Costello said, adding that she has received upwards of 300 unsolicited additional comments from educators since the report came out, all expressing similar sentiments. "I suspect (Clinton) might be right, but the data are not there to support the statement from a scientific-evidence-based perspective," said Dorothy Espelage, a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign and a leading expert in bullying. A Trump spokesman dismissed the survey, noting that it was unscientific. Our ruling Clinton said, "Parents and teachers are already worrying about what they call the ‘Trump Effect.’ They report that bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools, especially targeting students of color, Muslims, and immigrants." Teachers surveyed by the Southern Poverty Law Center study reported an increase in bullying and harassment, particularly involving anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim sentiments. Many of these teachers, unsolicited, cited Trump’s campaign rhetoric and the accompanying discourse as the likely reason for this behavior. The term Trump Effect is a product of the survey’s authors. And the survey is unscientific because it's based on anecdotal reports. But experts in bullying told us the Southern Poverty Law Center’s survey and their sense of current trends in schools supports Clinton’s point. We rate her claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/79685d56-6956-4e5e-8e24-60a56a099c5b	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-08-26T17:00:00	2016-08-25	['None']
pomt-10018	In Japan, executives of failing companies "say 'I'm sorry' and then either do one of two things: resign or go commit suicide."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/17/chuck-grassley/executives-japan-do-not-regularly-commit-suicide/	Lots of elected officials expressed outrage at the news that failing insurance company AIG was giving large bonuses to employees while accepting taxpayer money to stay afloat. But few expressed their outrage with AIG officials as starkly as Sen. Charles Grassley, Republican of Iowa. "I suggest, you know, obviously, maybe they ought to be removed," Grassley said. "But I would suggest the first thing that would make me feel a little bit better toward them if they'd follow the Japanese example and come before the American people and take that deep bow and say, I'm sorry, and then either do one of two things: resign or go commit suicide." "And in the case of the Japanese, they usually commit suicide before they make any apology." The next day, Grassley specified that he was not suggesting AIG executives should kill themselves, though he did say he wanted an apology. We wondered if Grassley was right that Japanese executives who make significant mistakes often apologize and then resign or commit suicide. We found many news stories of Japanese executives apologizing, a process in which the person stands and bows deeply. One story we found about a Sony battery problem detailed the exact posture of the executives. It noted they were seated while they bowed "and did not bow deeply," which signaled how Sony had been reluctant to admit fault. The story noted that none of the Sony executives resigned. We also spoke with Gary Knight, a professor of international business at Florida State University who teaches annual business courses in Japan. Knight confirmed that apologies and resignations are more common among Japanese executives than their U.S. counterparts. "Culturally, it's pretty different than the U.S.," Knight said. "It's certainly the norm that if a top executive commits a blunder that affects employees or customers, they would apologize for it." Resignations are common, too, though that doesn't always solve problems, Knight said. "The person resigning may be the most knowledgeable person at the firm. Meanwhile, you're faced with finding a manager who can solve the problem," he said. But executive suicides — not so common. Knight said they happen occasionally, but overall they are "pretty rare." Suicide in Japan is actually a serious social problem, according to several news reports. More than 30,000 people a year commit suicide in Japan, giving it one of the highest suicide rates among industrialized countries. None of the reports we reviewed singled out shamed executives, however. In fact, the most commonly cited groups of special concern were laid-off workers, the elderly and the young. In conclusion, we find that Grassley gets the apologies and resignations right, but overstates the regularity of suicides. Apologies appear to be much more common than suicides. So we rate his statement Half True.	None	Chuck Grassley	None	None	None	2009-03-17T18:48:00	2009-03-16	['Japan']
pomt-00370	"Bruce Ohr's wife, Nellie Ohr, worked for Fusion GPS – which was the firm hired by the Clinton campaign to write the dossier. Bruce Ohr gave the dossier to the FBI. The FBI then used the same dossier to spy on the Trump campaign."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2018/sep/11/mark-meadows/meadows-says-ohr-got-dossier-through-his-wife/	The special counsel’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election has brought a lot of names to the center of attention. The most recent is Bruce Ohr, a Justice Department official whose relationship with former British spy Christopher Steele has sounded alarms among congressional Republicans. In a matter of weeks, Ohr has transformed from a virtual unknown in politics to a favorite target of President Donald Trump and his allies. Rep. Mark Meadows, a western North Carolina Republican who is one of the president’s staunchest defenders and a leader of the House Freedom Caucus, has criticized Ohr for his connection to Steele, the author of the dossier that made claims about the president’s financial and personal ties to Russia. On Sept. 5, a week after a closed-door interview between Ohr and the House Oversight Committee, Meadows sent a letter asking the Justice Department to review Ohr’s contacts with Steele. But even before that request, Meadows was floating a theory for his supporters to consider. "Here are some key facts you need to know about Bruce Ohr to understand why he is important to our investigation," Meadows wrote in an email newsletter. "Bruce Ohr's wife, Nellie Ohr, worked for Fusion GPS — which was the firm hired by the Clinton campaign to write the dossier. Bruce Ohr gave the dossier to the FBI. The FBI then used the same dossier to spy on the Trump campaign." Other Trump allies have also sought to link Ohr, his wife and the dossier to the FBI’s wiretapping of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. During a July 12 congressional hearing with FBI agent Peter Strzok, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, leveled the same charge. "So Nellie Ohr works for Fusion, works for (Fusion GPS founder and former journalist) Glenn Simpson, and she's giving documents to Bruce Ohr, who’s giving them to the FBI," Jordan said. Details surrounding the dossier, the Page wiretap and the Russia investigation are still emerging. But much has been reported already, and we wondered how Meadows’ statement would stack up against publicly available information. The FBI’s National Press Office declined to comment. Ben Williamson, Meadows’ communications director, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Nellie Ohr "worked for Fusion GPS ... the firm hired by the Clinton campaign" Bruce Ohr’s wife, Nellie Ohr, is a 55-year-old former government official and Russia expert. Meadows is correct that during the 2016 election, Nellie Ohr worked for Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm that was hired to work for then-candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign, according to Fox News. But the firm’s research into Trump was already underway when the Clinton campaign got involved — a fact Meadows omitted in his email. Fusion GPS was originally hired by the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website. It was only after Trump secured the Republican nomination that Fusion GPS was hired on behalf of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee by their law firm, Perkins Coie, to continue compiling research about Trump, according to the New York Times. At that point, the firm hired Steele, who had sources in Russia. Steele produced 35 pages of research memos, which became collectively known as the Steele dossier and detailed some salacious — but not fully verified — claims about Trump. "Bruce Ohr gave the dossier to the FBI." While Nellie Ohr was employed by Fusion GPS, Bruce Ohr worked in the Justice Department. Although Meadows’ statement does not specifically allege that Bruce Ohr received the dossier from his wife, other Republicans have insisted that she acted as a go-between for Fusion GPS and law enforcement agencies. But as we noted in a fact-check of conservative pundit Hugh Hewitt about Jordan’s theory, there is no evidence that Nellie Ohr personally routed the dossier to the Justice Department. It is true, however, that Bruce Ohr gave the dossier to the FBI, according to former FBI agent Peter Strzok’s testimony. "Mr. Ohr provided information to the FBI that included material that is what everybody is calling the dossier, reporting from Mr. Steele," Strzok told lawmakers during a congressional hearing. But Bruce Ohr was not the FBI’s only source for the dossier. The FBI received multiple versions of the Steele dossier from several different people, according to an email Strzok sent colleagues in January 2017, which was obtained by The Hill. The late Sen. John McCain said he delivered a version of the dossier to then-FBI director James Comey in late 2016. David Corn, a reporter at Mother Jones, also admitted on Twitter that he provided the Steele memos to the FBI shortly after the election. Even Steele himself met with FBI officials on July 5, 2016, according to the New Yorker. Meadows’ omission of these details could be misleading for readers of his email. "The FBI then used the same dossier to spy on the Trump campaign." In October 2016, the FBI applied to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for a warrant to wiretap Page, a former Trump campaign adviser. The agency believed Page was "collaborating and conspiring with the Russian government" after being "the subject of targeted recruitment." In February 2018, Republicans and Democrats released competing memos about the application for surveillance, with Democrats pushing back on Republicans’ claims that the FBI did not properly secure a warrant and misused its surveillance capabilities, according to the New York Times. But on July 21, 2018, the Trump administration released a heavily redacted version of the documents related to the wiretapping. The documents revealed that the FBI did partly rely on claims first reported in the dossier. For example, the application cited claims from the dossier that Page, while visiting Moscow in the summer of 2016, met with two senior Russian representatives to talk about removing Ukraine-related sanctions the U.S. had imposed on Russia and other matters. The FBI said in the application that it suspected the person who hired Steele was looking to discredit the Trump campaign, but clarified that Steele’s previous reporting of "reliable information" as a British intelligence officer made the agency believe segments from the dossier were "credible." (The FBI eventually terminated its partnership with Steele in October 2016 after he made what the agency considered to be improper disclosures to the news media.) But the redacted documents also contained evidence against Page that did not come from the dossier. In fact, Page was on the FBI’s radar as early as 2013 for contacts with Russian intelligence, according to the New York Times. Meadows’ suggestion that the FBI’s wiretapping amounted to "spy(ing) on the Trump campaign" is also misleading, since the FBI secured a warrant from the FISA court to do so. Page also left the Trump campaign in September 2016, before the FBI applied for its warrant. Even some Republicans have objected to claims suggesting the wiretap could be considered spying. "I don't believe that them looking into Carter Page means they were spying on the campaign," said Florida Sen. Marco Rubio during an interview on CNN. It is worth noting that the Steele dossier did not trigger the special counsel’s investigation into the Trump campaign’s Russian connections. That probe began in July 2016 due to information from Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, as PolitiFact has shown before. Our ruling In an email newsletter, Meadows said Nellie Ohr worked for Fusion GPS, the Clinton campaign funded the Steele dossier, Bruce Ohr handed the dossier to the FBI, and the FBI used the dossier to spy on the Trump campaign. Meadows is correct that Nellie Ohr worked for Fusion GPS and that the Clinton campaign hired the firm to continue researching Trump. He is also right that Bruce Ohr provided the FBI a copy of the dossier. But the FBI received the dossier from multiple sources. And it is not entirely accurate to say the FBI used the dossier to spy on the Trump campaign since Page left the campaign in September 2016. The FBI relied in part on the dossier to secure a warrant to monitor Page, but the dossier was not the sole basis for the wiretap — and the wiretap was authorized in court. New details could emerge if further documents related to the wiretap are disclosed. But based on what we know now, we rate this statement Half True.

pomt-11844	"Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the average American family of four will receive a $1,182 tax cut."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/07/markwayne-mullin/oklahoma-rep-mullin-says-average-family-would-save/	Republicans promised that their tax overhaul would save money for the middle class, and Rep. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., was quick to make the case that it did. "I’m working alongside the White House and other members in the House to lessen the tax burden that currently weighs on so many Oklahomans," Mullin posted on his congressional blog. "Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the average American family of four will receive a $1,182 tax cut. Imagine what you could do with $1,182 more in your pocket!" Mullin's talking point has been popular among House Republicans trying to sell the tax plan. In the past week, we've heard House Speaker Paul Ryan and a Georgia congressman tout the same figure. In each case, they overstated the impact of the tax cut. Mullin did, too, but less so. Here's what you need to know. The figure comes from the House Ways and Means Committee, which wrote the tax bill. That committee calculated several scenarios for how the proposal’s changes could affect different types of taxpayers. The key elements in the committee's calculation involve tax brackets, the standard deduction and the child tax credit. Currently, there are seven brackets; these would be consolidated into four -- 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent, and 39.6 percent. In the meantime, the standard deduction would be raised from $12,000 to $24,000. And the child tax credit will be increased from $1,000 to $1,600, bolstered by a new $300 credit for parents and other dependents. The example Mullin highlighted refers to a "family of four making $59,000 per year." Here’s the scenario outlined in the House’s fact sheet, using the fictional example of "Steve and Melinda" with two middle school-aged children: "As a result of lower tax rates, a significantly larger standard deduction, and an enhanced Child Tax Credit and Family Flexibility Credit, Steve and Melinda will pay over $1,182 less in taxes than last year, reducing their total tax bill from $1,582 to only $400. "That’s more money they can use for whatever is important to them, whether it’s paying bills, purchasing a new refrigerator, or putting away savings for the future." The Ways and Means Committee said they chose a household income of $59,000 because it’s the median household income nationally. (Mullin talked about families and families are not identical to households, but in Oklahoma, the median family income is about $58,000, so the distinction makes little difference in his state.) For that amount of income, a family today would get $12,700 from the standard deduction, $16,200 in personal exemptions, leaving $30,100 in taxable income. Of that, $18,650 would be taxed at 10 percent and $11,450 would be taxed at 15 percent, meaning the preliminary tax liability would be $3,582.50. That would be adjusted with $2,000 in child tax credits, producing a final tax liability of $1,582.50. Under the new tax bill, the family would take a larger $24,000 standard deduction (the proposal eliminates personal exemptions), leaving $35,000 in taxable income. At the 12 percent rate, that would mean $4,200 in preliminary liability. This would be offset by $3,200 in child tax credits and $600 in family credits, leaving a final tax liability of $400. That’s a $1,182.50 tax cut. So the number adds up, but there are some caveats that show it might not work out this way for all families like Steve and Melinda’s. Watch out for deductions The GOP bill eliminates or shrinks a number of widely used itemized deductions, and those factors aren’t taken into account in the figure House estimate. The deductions eliminated or pared back in the bill include the mortgage interest deduction (for future mortgages, it would be capped at half its previous maximum); the state and local tax deduction (only $10,000 in property tax deductions would be allowed); the medical expense deduction; the casualty loss deduction; and the student loan interest deduction. For example, nearly 9 million people with high medical bills deduct them on the taxes. Exchanging these changes for a higher standard deduction may benefit many taxpayers, particularly those who choose not to itemize today. But some taxpayers who depend on these itemized deductions today may end up worse off if the bill is passed as is, even with the higher standard deduction. For this type of taxpayer, the loss of even one of those deductions could conceivably wipe out that $1,182 gain for certain types of families. The tax cut would fade over time David Kamin, a tax and budget specialist at the New York University law school, told us that the bill has some wrinkles that can turn a tax cut into a tax hike. Kamin cited a combination of factors, including the sunsetting of the $300 per parent tax credit; the lack of inflation adjustments for the child tax credit, which effectively replace personal exemptions that were indexed to inflation; and the new use of an inflation adjustment measure known as chained CPI, which grows more slowly than the yardstick in current use. According to Kamin’s calculations, the initial tax cut for the family making $59,000 becomes about a $450 tax increase by 2024 compared to the status quo. Here’s the graph he put together: Mullin didn’t promise that the initial tax cut would last, as other Republicans have. After Mullin made his statement, the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation analyzed the tax plan using a different approach. The committee found that while tax collections from people making under $40,000 would fall at first, they would go up in 2023. The groups that would do the best under the plan would be people making between $100,000 and $200,000, and those making over $1 million a year. Our ruling Mullin said that the average American family of four would get a tax cut of $1,182. The number is a reasonable estimate, based on certain assumptions. What might not be obvious is that families who take advantage of deductions today might see their taxes rise. And even those who benefit immediately might see those gains turn into losses after 2023. So if you think this tax cut would be ongoing, or every year, you'd be wrong. Unlike his colleagues, however, Mullin didn’t outright promise that the initial tax cut would last for more than one year. Mullin's statement therefore is accurate but needs additional information.

pomt-01542	Greg Abbott did "nothing" to pursue reports of the sexual abuse of boys at a West Texas state-run school.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2014/sep/16/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-claims-greg-abbott-didnt-act-allegatio/	In a TV ad suggesting Greg Abbott failed to act when allegations of misconduct came to his office, Wendy Davis reminds Texans of the sexual abuse scandal that touched off a 2007 legislative overhaul of the Texas Youth Commission. In the ad, a narrator says in a dark tone: "Young boys at a state-run school are sexually abused. When a local investigation lags, a Texas Ranger notifies Attorney General Greg Abbott, asking him to investigate. Abbott does nothing," the narrator says, adding that 11 months then went by with more incidents of abuse and neglect. "But Abbott didn’t pursue the case," the narrator says. By way of backup, the Davis campaign offered news stories describing attempts by a Texas Ranger to get authorities outside of West Texas, including the attorney general, to look into the alleged incidents at the West Texas State School in Pyote. We reviewed those news reports and others, which together chronicled initial inaction by a state lawyer before Abbott’s office presented the related allegations to a grand jury. Abbott does nothing? Public knowledge of alleged sexual wrongdoing by officials at the remote school traces to February 2007 news reports by the Texas Observer and Dallas Morning News. But a Texas Ranger, Brian Burzynski, had been on the case for years and had already reached out to the state for help. Burzynski emailed an assistant state attorney general, Will Tatum, on Feb. 21, 2006, graphically detailing sexual abuse of male youths at the school, according to information released by Abbott’s office in March 2007. The Ranger’s email said the local prosecutor had the case but "hasn't done anything with it and I am losing hope that he will. ... I would like you to view this report and tell me what you think." Burzynski had begun his investigation in February 2005. According to Abbott’s office, Tatum declined to pursue the case because of jurisdictional concerns; under state law, the attorney general’s office needed a local prosecutor to ask for assistance before it could get involved. As Burzynski’s emailed request became public, Abbott’s state spokesman, Jerry Strickland, said Tatum still should have forwarded the report to his supervisors before responding to the email, but he didn't follow agency procedures, according to news reports at the time. Knowing "the seriousness of the allegations contained in that email, action would have been taken by the attorney general's office, and this agency would have actively engaged in the matter in any way possible," Strickland said. But Strickland also said that two days after Burzynski sent the email, Tatum correctly told the Ranger that the Ward County district attorney, Randall Reynolds, would have to ask Abbott's office for help on the case. An April 2007 Austin American-Statesman news story said Tatum sent Burzynski the name and address of his supervisor, Adrien McFarland, for the Ranger to give to Reynolds. Abbott acted in 2007 Strickland said the attorney general's office began an aggressive investigation after Reynolds asked for help; that request came in Jan. 17, 2007. In April 2007, a Ward County grand jury returned 13 indictments against two former school administrators for improper sexual conduct with six students, ages 16-19, the attorney general’s office announced at the time. Abbott and other state prosecutors appeared before the grand jury to present the charges against former Texas Youth Commission officials Ray Edward Brookins and John Paul Hernandez, Abbott’s office said. Abbott said at the time: "With today's indictments, the victims of sexual abuse at West Texas State School are a step closer to the justice they deserve." According to the state announcement, on April 4, 2007, District Judge Bob Parks had granted the attorney general’s office sole authority to investigate and prosecute allegations of abuse at the Ward County facility. Parks appointed the attorney general as "District Attorney Pro Tem" after the local district attorney recused himself from the case, the announcement said. Footnote: In April 2010, a jury sentenced Brookins to 10 years in prison on his conviction for sexual relations with a teenage inmate. In 2011, a jury acquitted Hernandez on 14 counts of molesting boys in 2004 and 2005. Texas law on the attorney general and criminal prosecutions Generally, the April 2007 Statesman news story pointed out, the Texas attorney general is an executive who primarily defends the state in civil disputes, "though in local criminal cases involving fraud in insurance, Medicaid or elections, the attorney general can usually find a way to involve himself, one way or another. His staff, using a provision in the penal code dealing with computer crimes, can even initiate investigations into the solicitation of sex from minors on the Internet." Charges like the ones from West Texas, the story said, "are off-limits until a local prosecutor requests assistance in writing." Eric Nichols, deputy attorney general for criminal justice, told the newspaper the state agency followed the letter of the law. At the time, the Texas Government Code said: "A prosecuting attorney may request the assistance of the attorney general in the prosecution of all manner of criminal cases or in performing any duty imposed by law on the prosecuting attorney. In requesting such assistance, a prosecuting attorney may appoint any assistant attorney general as an assistant prosecuting attorney." The 2007 Legislature amended the law to say the attorney general may offer assistance in any criminal prosecution. Another adopted revision: The attorney general may offer assistance "in the prosecution of criminal offenses concerning the Texas Youth Commission." The Statesman story said two lawmakers, Democratic Reps. Jim McReynolds of Lufkin and Jim Dunnam of Waco, questioned Nichols about whether Abbott’s office should initially have done more: Even if he couldn't initiate prosecution, couldn't he have picked up the phone and called Reynolds, or even the governor, the state's chief executive officer? Nichols said in an interview at the time that Abbott’s aides assumed the local prosecutor was doing his job. "Do you automatically draw the conclusion that nothing is going to happen?" Nichols asked. On the other hand, the Statesman story said, it might not have mattered whether someone in the attorney general's office called Reynolds to offer help. Burzynski told lawmakers in 2007 that Reynolds continually assured him he would prosecute the case. The story said Reynolds had said little in his defense except to blame politics or a "breakdown in communications." A timeline accompanying the story said Abbott learned of the West Texas investigation at a meeting of senior agency staff Jan. 22, 2007. On March 9, 2007, Abbott announced the grand jury would soon begin hearing the case. Our ruling In her ad, Davis said Greg Abbott did nothing to pursue reports of the sexual abuse of boys at a state-run school. In 2006, Abbott’s office reacted to a Ranger’s report detailing such allegations by saying a local prosecutor needed to seek state assistance--and a state lawyer reportedly did nothing more. But this charge ignores a pivotal development. In 2007, after the local prosecutor requested help, state attorneys overseen by Abbott steered a grand-jury presentation leading to indictments.

pomt-10188	John McCain would "reduce oversight of health insurance."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/22/barack-obama/forecasting-another-market-collapse/	The recent meltdown in the financial markets, and the massive government-led bailout it inspired, has made deregulation almost a dirty word. Seizing on the spirit of the times, Barack Obama is accusing John McCain of preparing to eliminate regulations governing the sale of health insurance, in a continuation of what Obama contends are the too-hands-off regulatory policies of the Bush administration. "We’ve seen what Bush/McCain policies have done to our economy. Now, John McCain wants to do the same to our health care," an announcer intones in a new Obama campaign ad, called "Article," that was unveiled Sept. 22, 2008. "McCain just published an article praising Wall Street deregulation, said he’d reduce oversight of the health insurance industry, too. Just as we have done over the last decade in banking. Increasing costs and threatening coverage." The magazine article mentioned in the ad is an opinion piece McCain wrote in the September/October edition of Contingencies , a magazine published by the American Academy of Actuaries devoted to insurance and financial service issues. Obama wrote an accompanying piece in the same issue. We’ve already dealt with the McCain camp’s views on financial regulation in this item about former McCain adviser Phil Gramm , and this story that examined McCain's position on the bailout of insurance giant AIG. On the issue of health insurance, the Obama ad focuses on a section of the McCain article dealing with expanding consumer choice in health care. McCain advocates allowing individuals to purchase health insurance from companies across state lines. Currently, states oversee the health care insurance market within their borders, a system of regulation that McCain and others say limits consumer choices and inflates prices. "Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation," McCain wrote. "You should be able to buy your insurance from any willing provider – the state bureaucracies are no better than national ones." McCain is adapting a health care proposal long championed by conservatives in Congress and by the Bush administration that would allow insurers to bypass state-imposed coverage mandates for certain types of treatments and procedures, such as diabetes care and cancer screenings. The theory behind these proposals is that by eliminating the need to comply with a tangle of state regulations, small businesses and consumers would be more likely to band together and better able to negotiate lower prices, and thus reduce the number of uninsured Americans. Several bills that would have permitted this passed the U.S. House when the GOP controlled the chamber, but they died in the more closely divided Senate. Critics of such regulatory streamlining worry that it would destroy state-mandated consumer protections that include limiting how much and how often an employer can raise premiums when an employee gets sick, and eliminate state requirements on mental health and screenings such as those for cervical and breast cancers, leaving consumers at the mercy of insurers. (Health insurance generally is regulated by states, not the federal government, but the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, known as ERISA, does outline some requirements for employee benefit plans.) So, there are two elements here. First is the question of whether or not McCain wants to "reduce oversight of the health care industry." The answer largely hinges on how McCain would license insurance carriers to operate across state lines, and whether he would retain some of the existing rules while streamlining state regulations – complex but important details his campaign hasn’t provided. One scenario that Republicans considered in the Senate in 2006 would have allowed insurers to bypass state coverage mandates if they met certain minimum standards. Insurers who chose to offer such plans would have been required to offer at least one plan that matches the benefits offered to state employees of one of the five most populous states — California, Texas, New York, Florida and Illinois. Democrats blocked the proposal from being considered, so it’s unclear how McCain would have voted. Experts say without more details, it’s difficult to predict an answer to the second element, which is whether or not such changes would "increase costs and threaten coverage." Cori Uccello, the American Academy of Actuaries’ senior health fellow, says if new cross-country insurance rules were made more favorable to people in poor health, for example, sicker individuals would migrate to those interstate plans and gradually force premiums to rise. The opposite could occur if the new market’s rules had less generous coverage requirements and primarily attracted healthier individuals. Uccello says applying the same rules to all interstate plans could avoid such disparities. So it’s impossible to tell whether McCain’s plan would really drive up costs and threaten coverage, never mind unleash a calamity on the scale of what is currently sweeping through the financial sector. McCain certainly is on record supporting less state regulation of health insurance, which would reduce coverage mandates and put more of an onus on consumers to shop for the best deals. Whether this would result in more choice and lower prices, as McCain contends, depends on what kind of rules his administration would draft, and how insurers would respond. But lacking such details and the knowledge of how the market would react, it’s a stretch for Obama to suggest McCain is intent on taking a hands-off approach to health insurance. We rule his claim Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-09-22T00:00:00	2008-09-22	['None']
pomt-13210	Says Rob Portman "said the auto rescue was a lousy deal for Ohio."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2016/oct/20/ted-strickland/did-rob-portman-call-auto-bailout-lousy-deal/	Former Democratic Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland didn’t waste any time attacking Republican Sen. Rob Portman for opposing the 2009 automotive bailout and calling it a "lousy deal." "He said the auto rescue was a lousy deal for Ohio," Strickland told an audience during his opening statement at the third Senate debate in Cleveland. This isn’t the first time Strickland made this claim. Strickland made the charge in front of some Ohio delegates during a meeting held the week of the Democratic National Convention, according to the Columbus Dispatch. We wondered if Strickland was right. Did Portman call the automotive bailout a "lousy deal?" Strickland’s campaign said the remark in question comes from a 2009 statement from Portman, who was a candidate for Senate that year but was not yet in office. The campaign accessed the news release using the Wayback Machine, an Internet Archive website. "The General Motors bankruptcy plan Washington announced today is a lousy deal for Ohio," reads the statement. "Taxpayers, including hard working Ohioans, are investing $50 billion in a GM plan that we now find includes shutting down plants in Mansfield, Parma, and Columbus, Ohio. The reason for this unprecedented taxpayer bailout and government intervention was to preserve jobs. Instead, for our $50 Billion taxpayer investment, thousands more workers will see their jobs disappear. Ohio deserves better than this." That’s the only direct reference to "lousy" Strickland’s campaign sent PolitiFact Ohio, but they also sent an article from the Columbus Dispatch that quotes Portman’s former spokesperson in 2011 saying Portman still thinks "the auto bailout was not a good deal for Ohio." Portman’s campaign told PolitiFact Ohio that although Portman was not in office when the bailout launched, he would have supported the auto rescue. As evidence of this, Portman’s campaign pointed to a 2010 U.S. Senate debate against Democrat Lee Fisher. Portman was asked if he would have supported the 2009 bailout, which Portman responded to with a "yes," while also mentioning he would have liked to see "more conditions" in the bailout. "$50 billion of our taxpayer money went to a private entity that the government essentially took over, and then they closed four plants here in Ohio." Portman said at the debate. "So, if I had been in office at the time I would have supported it, but I would have been sure that Ohio didn’t fall behind." Our ruling Strickland said Portman "said the auto rescue was a lousy deal for Ohio." As a candidate for Senate, Portman did call the 2009 automotive bailouts of GM and Chrysler a "lousy deal" in a press release from 2009. Strickland cited this remark without including the fact Portman said he still would have supported the bailout. Strickland’s claim is accurate, but needs a slight clarification.

pomt-03965	Says Texas is last in workers' compensation coverage.	true	/texas/statements/2013/feb/14/sacramento-bee-editorial-board/sacramento-bee-editorial-says-texas-last-workers-c/	Taking umbrage at Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s campaign to lure California businesses, the Sacramento Bee swiped at Texas in an editorial stating that among its shortcomings, Texas is last in workers’ compensation coverage. Workers’ compensation coverage ensures employees get paid if they’re injured on the job, or that in work-related deaths, their families receive benefits. Before states started passing such laws in 1911, workers’ main recourse was to sue their employers, who usually won in court. Stuart Leavenworth, who edits the Bee’s editorial page, offered as a basis for this claim a February 2011 report, "Texas on the Brink," issued by a Texas House caucus called the Legislative Study Group. The basis for the report’s ranking on "workers’ compensation coverage" was 2006 data on the percentage of workers covered in each state that came from the National Academy of Social Insurance, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit group that researches such issues. And herein lies an important anomaly: Texas is the only state that does not require all employers to obtain workers’ compensation coverage. Experts we consulted agreed this is the reason why Texas consistently ranks last and well behind other states in the proportion of workers covered. There are exceptions; the National Federation of Independent Business says in an online comparison of such state laws that those include government construction contracts. In those cases, workers can file compensation claims, a right that employees usually give up in workers’ compensation agreements, "if they think they have a genuine case and the employer is still refusing to pay monetary benefits," the summary says. And other states exempt certain employers. The academy’s most recent data on the percentage of workers covered in each state comes from 2010. As charted in an August 2012 report, it shows that while Texas had 78.6 percent of workers covered, no other state had less than 94.9 percent covered. Thirteen states -- including California -- had 100 percent covered. Amy Lee, a Texas Department of Insurance expert on workers’ compensation at the Texas Department of Insurance, told us by email, "The 2012 estimate is that 19 percent of private Texas employees do not have (workers’ compensation) coverage," citing her agency’s 2012 analysis of employer participation in the Texas workers’ compensation system. Next, we wondered if there were other ways to rate states on their workers’ compensation coverage. Distinctions can include types of injury covered and differences in benefits paid. And going by some of them, Texas is not last in the nation. For example, division executive for state relations Lori Lovgren of the National Council on Compensation Insurance, which gathers and analyzes data on workers’ compensation, emailed us a 2012 report showing Texas ranked 38th in the business-friendly ranking of lowest cost to employers. Jennifer Wolf, executive director of an association representing state and provincial workers’ compensation systems in the U.S. and Canada, told us by email she would say there can be "quite a bit of difference" between states, especially "when you are comparing different types of benefits (temporary, permanent partial, permanent total)." Wolf’s group, the International Association of Industrial Accident Boards and Commissions, is based in Madison, Wis. Wolf and Lee said that most states’ systems have gradually come into line with a set of federal recommendations issued in 1972. Wolf said the most recent check on compliance with those guidelines was a Jan. 1, 2004, report from a branch of the U.S. Department of Labor. States averaged compliance with 12.83 of the 19 recommendations, the report said; Texas’ compliance was slightly below average, at 12.5. So the most significant difference between the states that we found is Texas’ voluntary system, under which 81 percent of private-sector workers get coverage not dissimilar to that across the country. Of the 19 percent in Texas that do not have government-mandated coverage, Lee said, "most have access to some sort of occupational benefits plan by their employer. The rest have no coverage." Rick Levy, legal director of the Texas AFL-CIO labor federation, said the alternative coverage offered by employers not subscribing to Texas’ system can offer "far inferior" benefits. "The fact that so many workers lack coverage at all really sets us apart from everybody." Our ruling The Bee said Texas is last in workers’ compensation coverage. Under state law, Texas remains the only U.S. state in which such coverage isn’t mandatory for all employers. And in 2010, 81 percent of Texas workers had such coverage, while nearly all workers were covered in the other states. The editorial’s statement is True.

pomt-07015	Says car insurance rates have decreased since about a decade ago because of market-based solutions that attracted more auto insurers to New Jersey.	true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jul/07/chris-christie/gov-chris-christie-credits-former-gov-jim-mcgreeve/	Gov. Chris Christie recently credited one of his Democratic predecessors for saving New Jersey drivers some money. Christie, a Republican, said former Gov. Jim McGreevey helped reduce auto insurance rates in a state where drivers struggled for decades with high costs and few insurance options. "I’ve got to give a shoutout to Governor McGreevey," Christie said in an "On the Line" interview with Steve Adubato. "He did a very good job on that while he was governor and our auto insurance, while still high, is not anywhere near as high as it used to be about a decade ago. And that's because we went to market-based solutions that brought more folks in here, created more competition, and now you have lower rates." Any New Jerseyan with four wheels and a driver’s license knows insuring those four wheels can get expensive. But are drivers in the state better off because of changes enacted by McGreevey? First, let’s tackle how auto insurance rates have fared over time. According to data compiled by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which represents insurance regulators, the average combined premium in New Jersey dropped from $1,316.49 in 1998 to $1,197.91 in 2008, the most recent year analyzed by the association. The state’s average combined premium, which is the average price for a policy that includes liability, collision and comprehensive coverage, peaked in 2004 at $1,386.46. PolitiFact New Jersey also looked at the average expenditure, a statistic that aims to measure what motorists spent on average for car insurance, including those who buy only liability coverage. The average expenditure in New Jersey dropped to $1,081.28 in 2008 from $1,138.28 in 1998. It peaked at $1,221.08 in 2004, according to NAIC numbers. The NAIC notes that these measurements are calculated with no distinction for deductibles, vehicle types and other factors that can affect auto insurance rates, and does not rank states because of these issues. However, the rankings can be compiled from data in the reports. According to our analysis, New Jersey had the most expensive combined average premiums in the nation, including Washington, D.C., from 1998 to 2004. In 2005 and 2006, D.C. pulled ahead and New Jersey dropped to second. But for the two most recent years of data, 2007 and 2008, New Jersey has ranked third, behind D.C. and Louisiana. The state’s rankings for average expenditure have a similar trend. Is McGreevey the reason for the drop? In 2003, McGreevey enacted changes to the state’s auto insurance regulations in a bid to attract more insurance companies to the state, increase competition and lower rates. The same year, California-based Mercury General, opened in New Jersey and other major insurance companies followed. Although New Jersey’s average combined premium and average expenditure on auto insurance peaked in 2004, they have fallen annually since then, according to NAIC data. But rates have also decreased nationally since 2004. A national expert on auto insurance told us that while the movement in rates in New Jersey mirrors national trends "to some extent," costs are being pushed down by state reform efforts from McGreevey in 2003, and from reforms enacted in the late 1990s. "It’s become a much more attractive place for companies," said David Snyder, American Insurance Association vice president and associate general counsel. Three other industry experts said the reforms enacted during McGreevey’s tenure deserve significant -- if not complete -- credit for cheaper auto insurance in New Jersey. John Dyke, a trustee of the trade group New Jersey Auto Agents Alliance, said "the reforms actually do help a lot because they drive competition within the market place." The economy also is a factor, Dyke said, because more people are opting for less coverage. Chuck Leitgeb, vice president of the Insurance Council of New Jersey, an organization that represents insurance companies in New Jersey, largely attributed the drop in prices to the reforms. The drop in the average expenditure is "unquestionably the results of the reforms," said Brian Sullivan, editor of Risk Information, which covers the insurance industry. "They’ve unleashed a competitive frenzy in New Jersey." Let’s recap. Christie said market-based reforms enacted during McGreevey’s tenure helped drive down auto insurance costs in New Jersey, and experts we spoke with said reforms enacted in 2003 played a significant -- if not complete -- role in reducing rates. We rate Christie’s statement True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Chris Christie	None	None	None	2011-07-07T05:15:00	2011-06-16	['None']
pomt-14135	"Increasing the min. wage to $15 an hour would reduce spending on food stamps, public housing and other programs by over $7.6 billion a year."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/05/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-minimum-wage-hike-15-would-red/	Though he’s significantly trailing Hillary Clinton in the Democratic delegate count, Bernie Sanders is keeping up the pressure on his primary rival, particularly on policy grounds. In a tweet sent on May 4, 2016 -- the day after Sanders won the Indiana primary -- Sanders reminded followers about his stance on the minimum wage, which is more aggressive than Clinton’s. Sanders supports raising the wage to $15 an hour, while Clinton has backed a raise to $12 an hour. (Currently, it’s $7.25 an hour.) "Increasing the min. wage to $15 an hour would reduce spending on food stamps, public housing and other programs by over $7.6 billion a year," Sanders tweeted. Is that correct? Not really. Sanders’ tweet rests on an analysis of increasing the minimum wage to $10.10, not to $15. In reality, economists have never modeled potential job losses caused by increasing the minimum wage to $15, which would be more than double the current level. In fact, some suggest that raising the minimum wage that high could produce enough job losses to increase -- not decrease -- public assistance costs. The source of Sanders’ statistic The number comes from the Economic Policy Institute, a left-of-center think tank, based on a minimum wage hike to $10.10. "Raising the minimum wage to $10.10 would reduce government expenditures on current income-support programs by $7.6 billion per year -- and possibly more, given the conservative nature of this estimate," EPI wrote. The author of the EPI paper, David Cooper, told PolitiFact that he and his colleagues did subsequently re-run the numbers -- not for a $15 minimum wage but for a $12 minimum wage. Their conclusion was that a bump to $12 would save an even higher amount than a bump to $10.10 -- specifically, $17 billion annually. So Sanders’ tweet, Cooper said, could actually be "an understatement." But even if you agree with that argument -- and many economists would not -- changing the calculation to a $15 minimum wage could make a big difference. Even Cooper acknowledged that there’s a degree of uncertainty about the impacts of a minimum wage hike as large as the one Sanders was referring to, if only because it hasn’t been studied. "I don't think we know definitively whether $15 would be different, because it is larger than the increases that have been rigorously studied," Cooper said. However, he added, "If you think $15 would have some sizable negative effect on employment or hours, it's going to moderate those savings (on government assistance programs). We have no way to know by how much." Economists are skeptical Other economists we checked with expressed even deeper skepticism. They said that even if you accept research that says modest minimum-wage increases don’t depress employment -- which, again, is a claim not all economists agree with -- it’s unwise to blithely assume that an increase to $15 will have no negative impact on hiring and hours worked. For instance, in 2014, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that an increase of the minimum wage from $7.25 to $9.00 would result in the loss of 100,000 jobs. But a rise to $10.10, CBO estimated, would swell that number fivefold, to 500,000. Scaling that calculation up to a $15 minimum wage would almost certainly increase net job losses further, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. "It’s very hard to believe that a minimum wage hike to $15 would produce the same adverse impact on employment as a hike to just $10.10," Burtless said. Indeed, the potential adverse impacts are "likely to be considerably bigger" at $15, he said. Others agreed. "A larger hike is more likely to cause a decrease in employment opportunities, and that could result in an increase in the demands for government support rather than a decrease," said Tara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University and the jobs site Indeed. Jonathan Meer, a Texas A&M University economist agreed. "These estimates are predicated on the notion that the minimum wage is a simple transfer from employers to employees, with no negative effects on employment," he said. "The higher the minimum wage goes, the worse of an assumption that is." What the Sanders camp says When we reached out to the Sanders campaign, they forwarded two supporting documents. One was a letter from 210 economists backing a minimum wage hike to $15 an hour. However, even this letter acknowledges that "raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour as of 2020 would entail an increase that is significantly above the typical pattern with federal minimum wage increases." The second was a study from the University of Washington that found little or no evidence of price increases at grocery, retail, or gasoline stores in Seattle relative to the surrounding areas after that city raised its minimum wage. However, while Seattle’s wage is eventually heading to $15, it has not reached that level yet, and the study only looked at the period after the wage increased from $9.47 to $11. That’s a jump of $1.53, not $7.75 -- the size of the federal increase if Sanders had his way. The authors of the University of Washington paper acknowledge this. "We have little reason to think that our initial impact assessment will adequately capture the full impact of the minimum wage ordinance," they wrote. "As some employers will have until 2021 to fully adapt to higher wages, the complete impact of the $15 minimum wage in Seattle may not be known for nearly a decade." One of the authors, University of Washington public policy professor Jacob L. Vigdor, told PolitiFact that "it's fair to say that we don't have evidence to support the public spending claim" made by Sanders. Our ruling Sanders tweeted, "Increasing the min. wage to $15 an hour would reduce spending on food stamps, public housing and other programs by over $7.6 billion a year." Sanders based this on a study that looked at what would happen if the minimum wage were raised to $10.10, not to $15. In reality, no such study of a $15 wage hike exists -- and economists say there’s good reason to believe that jobs lost from a wage hike that large could be significant. It might even be big enough to increase the cost of government assistance, not lower it. At the very least, a minimum wage increase this big is historically unprecedented, meaning that the degree of certainty in Sanders’ tweet is unsupported by academic evidence. We rate the claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1272716f-9515-4713-a64a-648c0f2d9108	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2016-05-05T10:52:23	2016-05-04	['None']
pomt-13694	Says Hillary Clinton's Iran nuclear deal "lined the pockets of the world's number one state sponsor of terrorism with your money."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jul/29/reince-priebus/iran-nuclear-deal-was-hillary-clintons-and-it-line/	In recent weeks, one of our most-clicked factchecks has been about an attack Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus made on Hillary Clinton back in April 2015. Priebus, a Wisconsinite, claimed that Clinton took "money from kings of Saudi Arabia and Morocco and Oman and Yemen." Our rating was Half True. His phrasing could have left the impression that Clinton herself, rather than the Clinton family foundation, received the money. (And Yemen doesn’t have a monarchy and didn’t make contributions to the foundation.) On July 21, 2016, Priebus attacked Clinton again, this time during his address to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. "In foreign policy, a Clinton presidency means forgetting our friends and enabling our enemies," Priebus charged. "Just look, just look at her disastrous Iran nuclear deal, which lined the pockets of the world’s number one state sponsor of terrorism with your money, while abandoning our greatest ally in the Middle East, the nation of Israel." Several days earlier in Cleveland, Priebus made one statement about the Bush family appearing at GOP conventions and another about "the facts" and "the best scenario for kids." Both were rated False by PolitiFact National. This claim is not looking so good, either. Terror sponsor The Republican Party didn’t respond to our requests for information to back Priebus’ statement. But labeling Iran the "number one state sponsor of terrorism" isn’t just rhetoric. Iran has been on the State Department’s official list of state sponsors of terrorism since 1984. And in its latest annual country report on terrorism, released in June 2016, the State Department said Iran "remained the foremost state sponsor of terrorism" in 2015. But Priebus’ characterization of the nuclear deal with Iran, struck in July 2015 with the United States and several other nations, is deeply flawed. Nuclear deal The deal was aimed at making it harder for Iran to make a nuclear bomb. At the time, it was believed Iran might be two to three months away from getting a nuclear bomb. But if Iran abides by restrictions imposed by the deal, scientists say, it would take at least 12 months to build a weapon. In exchange for curbing its nuclear program, Iran gets access to tens of billions of dollars in assets (estimates are as high as $150 billion, but the exact amount is not known). But the vast majority of those assets are Iran’s own money, not American cash. Those assets had been frozen as a result of sanctions imposed on Iran by the United States and other countries. CNN noted the deal includes the State Department agreeing to pay Iran $1.7 billion to settle a 35-year-old legal dispute over a trust fund that had been frozen since Iran's revolution. So, the nuclear deal arguably "lined the pockets" of Iran -- but almost all of it is Iran’s own money. One more thing -- and it’s a big one -- about the timing of the deal. Clinton has said that her work as secretary of state in putting together sanctions against Iran helped usher Iran to the negotiating table, a claim PolitiFact National rated Mostly True. But Clinton was referring to work she did in 2009 and 2010. And she left the secretary position in February 2013. That means Clinton was gone for 2.5 years before the nuclear deal was struck. In other words, the heavy lifting was done under the current secretary, John Kerry, although Clinton endorsed it. And President Barack Obama had to sign off on the deal, so it belongs to him more than any secretary of state. Our rating Priebus said Clinton's Iran nuclear deal "lined the pockets of the world's number one state sponsor of terrorism with your money." The United States labels Iran as the top state sponsor of terrorism. But the deal was struck 2.5 years after Clinton left the Obama administration. And the vast majority of the tens of billions of dollars that Iran gets is not American money, but its own assets, which were frozen by the U.S. and other countries that imposed sanctions on Iran. For a statement that contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d04632ed-a487-42ae-8342-dab37119b6af	None	Reince Priebus	None	None	None	2016-07-29T09:30:00	2016-07-21	['Iran']
pomt-14676	"California Senator, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, 'Give me your guns, I'm rounding 'em up,' she would."	false	/california/statements/2016/jan/15/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-misfires-feinstein-gun-claim/	LISTEN TO THIS STORY: Texas Senator Ted Cruz repeated a false claim about California Senator Dianne Feinstein and guns during Thursday night’s GOP presidential candidates debate in South Carolina. Cruz said at the debate: "California Senator, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, 'Give me your guns, I'm rounding 'em up,' she would." Cruz's claim is at the 9:30 minute mark in the video above. The Texas Republican made a nearly identical claim Jan. 7 in a CNN interview. We ruled it false. In that interview, Cruz told CNN: "I’ll tell you who I do take at her word is Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who said: ‘If I could go to Mr. America, Mrs. America, and say, hand over your guns, I want all of your guns, I would do it.’" We focused on Cruz's provocative comments that Feinstein said she wanted Americans to "hand over your guns, I want all your guns." We learned Cruz took a statement Feinstein made in 1995 about the assault weapons ban she authored far, far out of context. No love lost Cruz and Feinstein are about as far apart on gun rights as any politicians in Washington D.C. The senators famously sparred in 2013, during Feinstein’s unsuccessful attempt to pass a revamped assault weapons ban. At a Senate hearing, the longtime California senator accused Cruz of giving her a "lecture" on constitutional rights. "I’m not a sixth grader," Feinstein told Cruz, during a terse exchange. "I come from a different place than you. I respect your views. I ask you to respect my views." Cruz had suggested Feinstein was trying to pick apart the Second Amendment, in a way she would never try with the First or Fourth Amendments. Cruz is among the biggest gun rights backers in the GOP presidential candidate field. As Texas solicitor general, he led a successful fight before the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a Washington D.C. gun ban in 2008. His defense of the Second Amendment has continued this winter in stump speeches from New Hampshire to Nevada. Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) meets with attendees Tuesday, Jan. 12, 2016, during a campaign stop at Granite State Indoor Range in Hudson, N.H. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) Feinstein on guns Feinstein, by contrast, is considered a leader on gun control. In 1994, she authored the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, which was signed by President Bill Clinton. It prohibited the manufacture of 19 specific kinds of military-style, semi-automatic firearms, often called assault weapons. It also banned the manufacture and sale of gun magazines that hold more than 10 bullets. The bill expired in 2004 after efforts to extend it failed in Congress. Its restrictions did not apply to any semi-automatic weapons or magazines made before the ban’s effective date: Sept. 13, 1994. Video of Feinstein’s comment In an interview with 60 Minutes that aired in February 1995, correspondent Lesley Stahl asked Feinstein about this loophole, which made it legal to buy and sell hundreds of thousands of the assault weapons the senator had sought to restrict. Feinstein responded: "If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, ‘Mr. and Mrs. America turn ‘em all in,’ I would have done it. I could not do that. The votes weren’t here.’" Cruz’s campaign spokesman pointed to this statement when we asked him to back up the presidential hopeful’s claim. It’s available on YouTube as a short excerpt of the longer 60 Minutes piece. The YouTube video makes it clear that the interview is about the assault weapons ban. The term "assault weapon" is uttered in the first sentence, just as the video clip shows Feinstein hoisting up a semiautomatic weapon at a press conference. Nowhere in the short piece or the full interview does Feinstein discuss banning "all guns" as Cruz claimed. Feinstein does say in the TV interview that she wanted to ban all assault weapons, regardless of when they were made. She again made that point in a speech on the U.S. Senate floor several months after the 60 Minutes interview, in December 1995: "If I had my way, I would ban the possession of assault weapons anywhere in the United States of America, but there were not going to be the votes for that," she said, according to a transcript in the Congressional Record. Feinstein has outlined her support for legal gun ownership in many ways, including during the effort to renew the assault weapons ban. "Let me be clear: If an individual wants to purchase a weapon for hunting or self-defense, I support that right," Feinstein wrote in an op-ed in the San Francisco Chronicle in July 2012. Our ruling Cruz has claimed multiple times that Feinstein stated her desire to tell Americans "I want all of your guns," or "I'm rounding 'em up." When asked to show evidence of the claim, Cruz’s spokesman pointed to a short segment of a 60 Minutes piece that centered on Feinstein’s assault weapons ban from two decades ago. While Feinstein calls for an "outright ban" in the excerpt, a reasonable look at that sound bite, and a transcript of the full 60 Minutes interview, shows Feinstein is not referring to banning "all guns." Instead, she’s relaying that she failed to achieve her desired full ban on assault weapons. The full TV segment details a large loophole in the law that allows the sale and purchase of assault weapons made before the ban went into effect. Feinstein’s statement is clearly in response to concerns over that loophole. We rate Cruz’s claim False.

pomt-08956	"Should Democrats get their way, every income tax bracket will increase on Jan. 1, 2011. Every single one."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/22/mike-pence/mike-pence-says-democrats-want-all-bush-tax-cuts-e/	In a July 20, 2010, press conference, Rep. Mike Pence, R-Ind., the third-ranking House Republican, attacked the Democratic majority over tax policy. He said, "The American people deserve to know that, should Democrats get their way, every income tax bracket will increase on January 1, 2011. Every single one. You know, you don’t raise taxes on every American taxpayer during the worst recession in 25 years. As we’ve done on their failed stimulus policy, as we did on their national energy tax, as we did on their government takeover of health care, House Republicans will stand in the gap to protect taxpayers from the largest tax increase in American history." We thought it would be worth checking two aspects of Pence's statement. One is whether all tax brackets are indeed poised to rise when tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush expire at the end of this year. The other is whether the Democrats actually want that to happen. We'll take these in order. • Will every tax bracket increase? The answer is yes, unless Congress takes action. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, which is set to expire on Dec. 31, 2010, lowered income tax rates across the board, though studies have shown that the benefits of this law, when combined with other Bush-era tax cuts, tilted toward wealthier Americans. The law created a new, 10 percent tax rate for the lowest-income taxpayers (many of whom actually qualify for tax rebates under the Earned Income Tax Credit). It also chopped a few percentage points off most existing tax brackets, with the top rate for married households falling from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. If the tax cuts were to expire with no Congressional intervention, the pre-2001 tax brackets would spring back to life. Here's how the tax brackets would look on a before-and-after basis for married couples filing jointly based on their incomes. For simplicity, we're ignoring modest adjustments for inflation. Tax brackets for other categories such as individual filers broadly follow the same pattern. • Up to $16,750: Rises from 10 percent to 15 percent • From $16,751 to $58,200: Stays same at 15 percent, but entire bracket pays 5 percent additional on the first $16,750 • From $58,201 to $68,000: Rises from 15 percent to 28 percent • From $68,001 to $137,300: Rises from 25 percent to 28 percent • From $137,301 to $209,250: Rises from 28 percent to 31 percent • From $209,251 to $373,650: Rises from 33 percent to 36 percent • $373,651 and up: Rises from 35 percent to 39.6 percent So on this point, Pence is correct, assuming Congress does nothing. • Do Democrats want every tax bracket to rise, as Pence suggests? In a word, no. For many months, Democratic officials have consistently said that they intend to let only the tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals lapse. The cutoff they usually suggest is $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for married couples filing jointly. President Obama campaigned on just such a plan, and we've logged those promises into our Obameter campaign promises database. Take this Reuters article published July 13, 2010, just days before Pence made his comments. "The U.S. Congress will likely act to extend tax cuts for the middle class to avoid choking off the fragile economic recovery, key congressional Democrats said on Tuesday. House Democratic Leader Steny Hoyer said he expected the House to push to extend middle-class tax cuts before they expire at year end but suggested cutting taxes for the wealthy is less urgent. 'What you want to do is stimulate at this point in time, so you certainly do not want to increase taxes on the middle class, middle-income working Americans,' Hoyer told reporters. President Barack Obama and his Democratic allies in Congress have vowed not to raise taxes on individuals earning less than $200,000 or couples making less than $250,000." A bill to do this is not yet finished, but spokesmen for both Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and the House Ways and Means Committee confirmed to PolitiFact that the legislative proposal they're working on would extend the tax cuts for all taxpayers below an income threshold. A Pence spokesman countered with another Hoyer remark, made June 22, 2010, during a forum on deficit reduction. Hoyer told the audience that "as the House and Senate debate what to do with the expiring Bush tax cuts in the coming weeks, we need to have a serious discussion about their implications for our fiscal outlook, including whether we can afford to permanently extend them before we have a real plan for long-term deficit reduction," according to an Associated Press report. This suggests that at least one leading Democrat is undecided about how to proceed with the Bush tax cuts in the long term. However, we don’t see this as strong evidence for Pence’s claim. First, Hoyer, in comments to reporters after the June 22 event, said, "I don't think this is the time to increase taxes." He said that any tax increases, if they happen at all, would need to take place after the economy recovers. He didn't express any opposition to temporary extensions of the tax cuts (at least for middle- and lower-income Americans) -- and that’s the only factor that’s relevant in judging Pence’s quote. While Pence would be on safe ground questioning Hoyer’s commitment to a permanent extension, he’s wrong to say that Hoyer would somehow "get (his) way" by seeing all tax brackets increase on Jan. 1, 2011. Just to be safe, we checked with Hoyer’s office to nail down his stance on a temporary extension. Communications director Katie Grant confirmed that Hoyer favors at least a temporary extension to prevent a tax increase on Jan. 1, 2011. If anything, the momentum within the Democratic Party may be in the direction of keeping the Bush tax cuts for everyone, even for the wealthy. On July 22, 2010, news reports indicated that Democratic Sens. Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Kent Conrad of North Dakota had joined a growing chorus of Democrats who think it might be a good idea to extend the Bush tax cuts for everyone, at least until the economy has recovered. Pence is right that every tax bracket will go up if the law is not extended. Still, we think the claim that Democrats don't want to extend the law is inaccurate. While the legislative drafting is still in process, the Democratic majority in Congress has made clear that it plans to extend tax cuts for all but the top couple percentage points of the income distribution. So it's highly misleading for him to say that Democrats actually want to see all the bill's cuts expire. Indeed, Pence's comment verges on a scare tactic. While Pence would have been entirely accurate to say, "If the Democrats fail to extend the expiring tax cuts, all tax brackets will increase," he didn't. What he did say merits a ruling of False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c0d67665-83ed-4917-9c62-18f8b2669155	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2010-07-22T10:02:21	2010-07-20	['None']
pomt-12856	Says that in Texas, it’s "already illegal to enter a bathroom to harm someone."	half-true	/texas/statements/2017/feb/01/sylvia-garcia/half-true-senators-claim-its-already-illegal-enter/	A Democratic opponent of a legislative proposal dictating who enters which bathrooms says existing law already bars Texans from slipping into facilities intending to do wrong. Houston state Sen. Sylvia Garcia declared in a Jan. 5, 2017 press release: "All Texans want to go to the bathroom in peace, including transgender people. That’s why it’s already illegal to enter a bathroom to harm someone." We wondered about that as the Texas proposal, dubbed the Texas Privacy Act by authoring Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, R-Brenham, was assigned to a Senate committee in early 2017. Senate Bill 6 primarily would require transgender people to use bathrooms in government buildings, public schools and universities corresponding with the sex they were assigned at birth. The proposal also would prohibit city and county officials from adopting ordinances that prevent private businesses from making policies for their bathrooms and dressing rooms. Nationally through the first few weeks of 2017, GOP lawmakers in eight states, including Texas, had proposed bathroom-related legislation, according to tracking by the National Conference of State Legislatures. And over the previous few years, at least 24 states considered "bathroom bills," though North Carolina was the only state to have passed and implemented a measure, according to the group. In Texas, Democrats have denounced Kolkhorst’s measure as discriminatory against transgender people and warned that it could harm Texas businesses and tourism. Proponents led by Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick say the measure will keep men from entering women’s restrooms to commit crimes. So, is entering a bathroom with plans to hurt someone already against Texas law? Asked to appraise Garcia’s claim, a Kolkhorst spokesman, Matthew Russell, said by email it’s incorrect that Texas law already forbids a person from entering a restroom for the purpose of committing a crime. Russell also provided a statement from Kolkhorst conceding that laws "exist to protect people everywhere from harm," but her legislation, Kolkhorst said, "specifically recognizes that predators often seek to target victims in vulnerable locations such as showers, locker rooms and restrooms." Garcia's backup In contrast, a Garcia aide guided us to a Houston ordinance and a state criminal law pertaining to public bathrooms. John Chapa Gorczynski, Garcia’s chief of staff, noted a Houston city ordinance that makes it a crime to enter an opposite-sex restroom without permission. The 1968 ordinance states: "It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly and intentionally enter any public restroom designated for the exclusive use of the sex opposite to such person's sex without the permission of the owner, tenant, manager, lessee or other person in charge of the premises, in a manner calculated to cause a disturbance." Those, of course, are one big city’s restrictions. YetChapa Gorczynski also pointed out sections of state criminal laws forbidding certain behaviors, though in them we saw no general proscription against entering the bathroom designated for an opposite sex. Chapter 42 of the Texas Penal Code, prohibits anyone from looking into "an area such as a restroom or shower stall or changing or dressing room that is designed to provide privacy to a person using the area." Other parts of the code pointed out by Garcia’s aide: Chapter 20.01 and 20.02 – Illegal to restrain a person against their will anywhere Chapter 21.07 and 21.08 – Outlaws public lewdness and indecent exposure in public places, including acts of "deviate sexual intercourse" or "act of sexual contact" Chapter 21.15 – Against the law to make invasive visual recordings where someone "has a reasonable expectation that the intimate area is not subject to public view" including, the law specifies, bathrooms and changing rooms Chapter 21.16 – Voyeurism with the intent "to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of the actor" also is against the law At the Texas Municipal League, which says it serves more than 16,000 mayors, councilmembers, city managers, city attorneys, and city department heads, an official said by email that Houston’s bathroom entry ordinance might be unique. Bennett Sandlin said: "I’m not aware of any other ordinances that get into the specifics of bathroom access. Most of the cities that have them are more generic in terms of supporting civil rights," meaning access to public services and accommodations regardless of a person’s race, sexual orientation or gender identity, he said. Our ruling Garcia said it’s already illegal in Texas to enter a bathroom to harm someone. In many ways, significantly, Texas laws forbid a person from harming another person. Also, a longstanding Houston ordinance bars a person from entering the incorrect bathroom. But Garcia didn’t show nor did we find similar no-entry restrictions in place statewide or in other cities.

pomt-01714	"So far, the war in Gaza has left more than 1,800 Palestinians dead -- the population equivalent to 100 9/11s."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/07/joy-reid/joy-reid-compares-deaths-gaza-911-deaths/	Whenever tragedy strikes abroad, pundits often make a point to translate death tolls into dead Americans. The Israeli-Palestinian war is no exception. On her Aug. 4 Reid Report, Joy Reid called out the United Nations for their inability to stop or temper Israel’s campaign in Gaza. The UN’s "condemnations and expressions of outrage," Reid said, "have done exactly nothing to protect civilians in Gaza." "So far the war in Gaza has left more than 1,800 Palestinians dead -- the population equivalent to 100 9/11s." Americans don’t take the name of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in vain. So we wanted to dig into Reid’s claim: Does her math check out, and is she right to compare the impact of the Palestinian deaths to what Reid defined as the American "population equivalent"? Reid’s math, and why 9/11s are not a unit To consider Reid's claim, you need to first know that Reid is essentially looking at the percentage of deaths per population. For one part of the comparison, she's using the population of Gaza, which is pretty straightforward. For the other part of the comparison, she's choosing to use the entire population of the United States. And as we'll show you, that makes all the difference. Reid's napkin math is relatively straightforward. Roughly 1,800 Palestinians have died out of 1.8 million in Gaza, which equals 0.1 percent of its population. Roughly 3,000 out of 300 million Americans died directly in the Sept. 11 attacks, which works out to 0.001 percent of America’s population. Compare the two and you get that .1 percent is 100 times 0.001 percent. That’s where "100 9/11s" comes from. If you use slightly more precise numbers, it doesn’t move the needle that much. The United Nations report issued on Aug. 4, when Reid made her claim, put the number of Palestinian deaths at 1,777 (not more than 1,800, as Reid said), and the CIA estimates Gaza’s population at 1,816,379. A 10-year memorandum on the Sept. 11 attacks from the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism puts the number of deaths in the Sept. 11 attacks at 2,997, and the United States Census Bureau population clock puts the U.S. population on Sept. 11, 2011, at 285,558,980. Using those numbers, we get that Palestine’s death count is the "population equivalent" of 93.22 9/11s when using the entire population of the United States. That's not quite Reid’s 100, but it's not substantially different. But our fractional result does help demonstrate that 9/11s are not a particularly good unit of measurement. It’s unclear what 0.22 of a 9/11 -- or for that matter, 100 9/11s -- would look like. Impact on society Comparing death tolls as proportions of population is misleading, experts told us. In his book How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking, University of Wisconsin mathematician Jordan Ellenberg explains how, while occasionally useful, taking population equivalents quickly becomes ridiculous if you apply it to extreme cases. For example, Ellenberg writes, the 1,074 Israelis killed by Palestinians from 2000-05 works out to 50,000 Americans, but if you scale down instead of up, it loses its punch. The same Israeli death toll, he says, is proportional to only one or two deaths in Tuvalu, a Polynesian island with roughly 1,000 inhabitants. "When commentators in Israel and Palestine were observing 9/11 when it happened, people weren’t saying, ‘Imagine if 20 Palestinians had been killed,’ " Ellenberg told us. Similarly, the Palestinian death count from the last couple of weeks is the "population equivalent" of about 1.3 million Chinese, but only one Tuvaluan -- not quite as rhetorically overwhelming as "100 9/11s." The problem, Ellenburg wrote in a 2006 Slate article, is that our "innate number sense simply doesn’t extend" to extremely small numbers. He uses the example of a Hezbollah bombing of the Israeli city of Haifa, which killed one in every 787,500 Israelis. "Imagine that it was actually one in 78,750. You just multiplied the scale of the crime tenfold, but can you say sincerely that the two numbers inspire a different reaction? The proportions are just too small to comprehend." Beyond that, Ellenberg told us, "there’s a huge amount of wiggle room in how you count what population you divide by." If you use just the population of New York City instead of the entire United States, the Palestinian death count works out to about three 9/11s. And if you limit yourself only to the population of Manhattan, you get less than one 9/11. It’s not clear which figure is the best choice to put the Palestinian death count in context -- or if any of them are even useful. Population equivalent, but not morally equivalent Reid's comment also can be seen as trying to create a moral equivalence. But that doesn’t hold water, said Oxford ethicist Anders Herlitz. "Most moral theories would say that the moral worth of individual lives are not comparable at all," Herlitz said. "According to this line of thinking, we cannot measure the life of one against the life of many." The only "sound ethical theory" that does let you make what philosophers call "inter-personal comparisons" is utilitarianism, Herlitz said, which posits that "all lives are of equal worth. One Palestinian equals one Israeli equals one American, and so on." So there’s no ethical sense in which 1,800 Palestinian deaths are comparable to "100 9/11s." Our ruling Reid, decrying the UN’s failure to temper the rising death counts in Gaza, said, "So far, the war in Gaza has left more than 1,800 Palestinians dead -- the population equivalent to 100 9/11s." She used a couple of rough estimates, but Reid’s math basically works out for the parameters she set. The parameters, however, are the problem. Using 9/11s as a unit ignores qualitative differences between the Sept. 11 attack and the Israeli-Palestinian war. It’s also not clear what populations she’s referring to, and while looking at deaths as a proportion of population can be useful, the numbers here are too small for them to mean much. There are also at least equally valid and different ways to compare deaths as a proportion of population that would produce vastly different results. (Going from 100 9/11s to less than 1 9/11.) Reid’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate her claim Mostly False.

pomt-01859	"I created the school choice program."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jul/13/gary-george/gary-george-says-he-created-school-choice-program/	In the history of Wisconsin’s groundbreaking private school choice program, as told by journalists and scholars, Democrat Annette "Polly" Williams is the godmother of the movement and Republican Tommy Thompson the godfather. But Gary George is bluntly rewriting those accounts as he attempts to resurrect his political career through a challenge to US Rep. Gwen Moore, another Democrat from Milwaukee. "I created the school choice program, which ushered in not only an era of educational reform in Wisconsin, but really throughout the nation and around the world," George, a former state senator, told newsman Mike Gousha on WISN-TV’s "Upfront" show July 6, 2014. Who deserves the title of creator? The word has several meanings, including "to cause to come into being," or "evolved from one’s own thought or imagination." How it passed George pointed us to the final amended bill that became law in 1990, when it was signed by Thompson, who was governor at the time. That bill allowed poor Milwaukee parents to use publicly funded vouchers to send their children to private, non-religious schools of their choosing. It was a scaled-down version of a Republican plan that sought to include religious schools. To become law, the bill had to clear Joint Finance, the powerful committee that George co-chaired with Milwaukee Democrat Walter Kunicki. It was part of a multi-issue budget bill. As heads of the committee, George and Kunicki were listed as authors of the bill. George brokered several changes, getting the support of Williams and others. George’s role was "crucial" in winning passage, wrote James Carl, a scholar of urban education reform, in his book, "Freedom of Choice: Vouchers in American Education." Williams told PolitiFact Wisconsin the same: "I give him his props. We couldn’t have gotten that bill passed without his help." Other participants agreed. Howard Fuller, a Milwaukee Public Schools critic who went on to become superintendent, told us that "if Polly had not come to an agreement with Gary, it would not have passed." So George can lay claim to a significant role in the legislation that created the choice program. But there’s little doubt that the final product was largely drawn from an earlier bill drafted by Williams, then a state representative, and educational activist Larry Harwell. Indeed, George appears to have had little if any role in the decades-long legislative battles that came before the measure finally passed. And in his book, Carl flatly calls Williams "the state representative who authored the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program." Further back in history Williams and Harwell were among the varied and sometimes competing forces -- some liberal Democrats, religious leaders, conservatives, business leaders -- who began pushing in the late 1960s for choice and independent community schools in Milwaukee’s central city. Some legislation was considered and voted on in the 1970s and into the 1980s but the partisan political obstacles were many. The decisive action, put in motion by Thompson, came during the Republican governor’s first term in the late 1980s. The reform-minded Thompson was rebuffed in 1988 when he sought a voucher program in Milwaukee that included religious schools. George did not favor the plan and Joint Finance deleted it from the state budget, amid teachers union opposition to the governor’s move. Thompson tried again in early 1989 with a similar result, but momentum built when Milwaukee Public Schools leaders put forward their own choice plan. George’s policy adviser, Walter Farrell, started warming to the bill, Carl recounted in his book. At that point, Williams, who opposed the MPS plan, authored her own, but it fell in the state Assembly. She redrafted new legislation in mid-1989 and worked to get bipartisan support. The governor, as well as Milwaukee Mayor John Norquist, got behind it. Teachers union opposition faded. Williams "helped persuade (George) to support their legislation," Carl wrote in his book. "After meeting with community residents and Thompson, George eventually came down on Williams’ side." The Williams-authored bill easily passed the Assembly, but was bottled up in a Senate committee until George attached it to a budget bill and made changes that Williams agreed to. It worked. Senate and Assembly passage followed, and Thompson signed it in April 1990, winning praise from President George H. W. Bush. In news accounts at the time, Thompson credited Williams for the plan, and George offered a cautious comment: "We’ll see if this is an experiment that works." Today, Fuller sees Williams as deserving of the most credit, despite George’s crucial late work. George told us: "Polly Williams, she had the concept, but you have to legislate it. It’s legislation, so there’s no parentage." Williams says now she is bitter at what she sees as a misguided Republican expansion of choice beyond Milwaukee and to wealthier families in recent years. But she’s proud of what she did and politely disagreed with George’s comments. "He didn’t create it," she said. Thompson told PolitiFact Wisconsin he sees it this way: "It was my idea, and both Williams and George had a lot to do with it. Our rating George told an interviewer: "I created the school choice program." Clearly the former senator helped give birth to choice, steering it through the Senate with crucial changes and granting his crucial support. But George didn’t conceive of the idea. And his account crowds out the long leadership -- and more prominent role -- of both Williams and Thompson, not to mention Williams’ authorship of the bill George modified. Our definition of Half True is a statement that is partially accurate, but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That fits here.

John McCain said, 'No.' "	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/02/fred-thompson/mccain-bargained-with-his-vietnamese-captors/	In his speech Sept. 2, 2008, to the Republican National Convention, former U.S. Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., recounted John McCain's time as a prisoner of war in Vietnam after his Navy plane was shot down in October 1967. "They took him to the Hanoi Hilton, where he lapsed in and out of consciousness for days," Thompson said in St. Paul, Minn. "He was offered medical care for his injuries if he would give up military information in return. John McCain said, 'No.' " Thompson compresses details of McCain's biography to offer the most positive picture of the Republicans' 2008 standard-bearer. But in doing so he contradicts statements McCain made in his bestselling autobiography, Faith of My Fathers. In the book, co-written with Mark Salter, McCain recounts the grievous wounds he suffered when shot down and afterward at the hands of angry Vietnamese. He was taken to the Maison Centrale, known to POWs as the Hanoi Hilton, where he did lapse in and out of consciousness for four days and refuse his interrogators' demands for information. But then, McCain recounts, he tried a different approach with a prison officer nicknamed "Bug.'' "Desperate, I tried to bargain with him. 'Take me to the hospital and I'll give you the information you want.' I didn't intend to keep my word, reasoning that after my injuries had been treated, I would be strong enough to deal with the consequences of not holding up my end of the bargain,'' McCain wrote. As for never cooperating with Vietnamese, McCain also admits he eventually gave up information about his ship and Navy squadron. "I regret very much having done so,'' he wrote.

pomt-10335	"For at least a year now, I have called for two additional brigades, perhaps three."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/22/barack-obama/obama-proposed-more-troops-in-07/	During an overseas trip to Afghanistan, Sen. Barack Obama said the United States needed to focus on the war there, calling the situation "precarious and urgent," adding "I believe this has to be our central focus, the central front, on our battle against terrorism." "For at least a year now, I have called for two additional brigades, perhaps three," he said. We consulted the record to see if Obama had urged more troops for Afghanistan that long. Back on Aug. 1, 2007, Obama gave a major foreign policy speech at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C. The speech got a lot of attention because Obama said that the United States should aggressively pursue terrorists hiding in the mountains of Pakistan. "If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and President Musharraf won't act, we will," Obama said. (See our previous Truth-O-Meter rulings about Obama's stance on Pakistan here , here and here. ) But Obama also talked about the need for the United States to turn its attention to Afghanistan. "Our troops have fought valiantly there, but Iraq has deprived them of the support they need — and deserve," Obama said. "As a result, parts of Afghanistan are falling into the hands of the Taliban, and a mix of terrorism, drugs, and corruption threatens to overwhelm the country. As president, I would deploy at least two additional brigades to Afghanistan to re-enforce our counterterrorism operations and support NATO's efforts against the Taliban." That speech was the first time we could find of Obama specifically advocating for more brigades to Afghanistan. Technically speaking, the time from his speech on Aug. 1, 2007, to his more recent statement is 10 days short of a year. But it's pretty darn close, and it's likely that speech reflected policy crafted over a longer period than 10 days. So we find his statement True.

pomt-10495	"I actually started criticizing the war in Iraq before (Obama) did."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/07/hillary-clinton/nope-obama-was-first-in-the-senate-too/	From the beginning of her presidential campaign, Sen. Hillary Clinton has been answering for her vote to authorize the use of force in Iraq, a vote that begat a war that has grown ever more unpopular. It hasn't helped that Sen. Barack Obama has been able criticize her vote with impunity because at the time of the vote he was in the Illinois state senate and rather famously gave a speech at a rally opposing an invasion. At a campaign stop in Eugene, Ore., on April 5, 2008, Clinton was asked again by an audience member to explain her 2002 vote. Clinton responded by saying that Obama may have opposed the war prior to the invasion, but she was the first to criticize the war once he became a U.S. Senator in January 2005. "When Sen. Obama came to the Senate, he and I have voted exactly the same except for one vote. And that happens to be the facts. We both voted against early deadlines. I actually started criticizing the war in Iraq before he did. So I'm well aware that his entire campaign is premised on a speech he made in 2002, and I give him credit for that speech," she said. Iraq has been a hot-button issue in the race for the Democratic nomination since the start. A whopping 91 percent percent of Democrats disapprove of the way George W. Bush is handling Iraq, according to a March 2008 CBS News poll. Indeed, we spent a lot of time earlier in the campaign documenting which Democrats were against the war first or wanted the fastest withdrawal . Clinton cannot claim to have opposed the war before Obama, so by focusing on who spoke more critically of Iraq beginning with his arrival in the Senate, Clinton wants to reset the clock on this debate. It's a novel strategy, and we wondered if it might work, given that she has spoken out strongly against the Bush administration's war efforts in the years since her Iraq vote. But a little research shows her new timeline doesn't work any better than the old one. Obama still is first. And we're not the first to have done this. Clinton's remarks didn't sound right to Jake Tapper of ABC News, who reported the remarks and debunked them earlier on his "Political Punch" blog . Obama took office on Jan. 3, 2005. One of his early assignments on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was to participate in a hearing to confirm Condoleezza Rice as Secretary of State. On Jan. 18, Obama questioned Rice during the hearing about how quickly Iraqi troops were being trained and whether they truly were ready to defend their own country. Obama said then that if success in Iraq is "measured by whether Iraqis can secure their own circumstances, and if our best troops in the world are having trouble controlling the situation with 150,000 or so, it sounds like we've got a long way to go. "And I think part of what the American people are going to need is some certainty, not an absolute timetable, but a little more certainty than is being provided, because right now, it appears to be an entirely open-ended commitment." Sounds like criticism to us. Clinton, meanwhile, weighed in a week later with a statement on Rice's nomination, saying, "In her role as National Security Advisor, Dr. Rice was a member of the team responsible for our flawed Iraq policy. She made several misleading statements about the presence of weapons of mass destruction in the lead up to the war." Clinton also said in the statement the she profoundly disagreed and deeply regretted how the war has been conducted. Clinton might be showing moxie by trying to reframe the Iraq issue in a way that puts her on top, but the facts don't support it. On the statement that she criticized the war first after Obama became a senator, the Truth-O-Meter says False.

pomt-06953	Georgia’s illegal-immigration legislation "simply follows existing federal law."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/jul/18/jack-murphy/does-georgias-immigration-bill-simply-follow-exiti/	Just hours after a federal judge ordered a preliminary injunction of Georgia’s legislation to crack down on illegal immigration, a state senator who pushed to get the bill passed laid out what he considered the positives about the ruling. Sen. Jack Murphy, a Republican from Cumming, noted the judge struck down several arguments by the plaintiffs who filed the lawsuit against the legislation. But it was the final words of Murphy’s press release that made us reach for the law books. "This law simply follows existing federal law," the release said. We wondered about the senator’s claim since supporters of the Georgia legislation, House Bill 87, pushed for the bill largely because they felt the federal government has done a poor job enforcing its immigration laws and keeping illegal immigrants out of the country. Before Gov. Nathan Deal signed House Bill 87, its supporters also argued the legislation would survive legal challenges. The bill requires all Georgia companies with more than 10 employees to verify the immigration status of all new employees, using the federal government’s E-Verify program. It says businesses that do contract work for the state, their subcontractors and their sub-subcontractors must participate in E-Verify. It gives law enforcement authority to check the immigration status of someone detained on probable cause of committing a crime. Judge Thomas Thrash was concerned about Section 8 of the legislation, which he wrote "will convert many routine encounters with law enforcement into lengthy and intrusive immigration status investigations. Thus, the individual plaintiffs have shown a realistic threat of injury as a result of HB 87." Murphy and others expect the legislation to be appealed to the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals and possibly heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. Murphy sent us a statement to back up the claim in his press release. Much of it focused on a section of federal code on immigration about hiring and harboring illegal immigrants and the penalties for document fraud. The general themes of the federal law and Georgia’s legislation, HB 87, are similar. They both say it’s bad to hire or harbor illegal immigrants, and impose fines and possible prison time for anyone who aids in either process. They both have fines and prison sentences for anyone who commits document fraud. Georgia’s legislation makes several references to following the guidelines of federal law. Thrash, however, said there are big differences between the state legislation and federal law. "Despite superficial similarities, however, Section 7 [of HB 87] is not identical to 1324 [in the federal code]," Thrash wrote in his ruling. "For example," he wrote, "O.C.G.A. 16-11-202 prohibits knowingly inducing, enticing or assisting illegal aliens to enter Georgia. Section 1324’s corresponding ‘inducement’ provision prohibits inducing an alien to ‘come to, enter, or reside in the United States.’ Once in the United States, it is not a federal crime to induce an illegal alien to enter Georgia from another state." Thrash also wrote that the "defendants wildly exaggerate the scope of the federal crime of harboring under 1324 when they claim that the plaintiffs are violating federal immigration law by giving rides to their friends and neighbors who are illegal aliens." Muzaffar Chishti, an official with the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, said "the [Georgia bill] prohibits knowingly inducing, enticing or assisting undocumented immigrants to enter Georgia, whereas it is not a federal crime to induce an undocumented immigrant to enter Georgia from another state." He added that the language in the Georgia bill that creates fines and sentences for violators "allows the state to use prosecutorial discretion and judicial interpretation differently than the federal system." Chishti noted that Thrash had those same concerns, pointing to a portion of a federal court ruling concerning Arizona’s illegal-immigration legislation. "[A]lthough Section 7 appears superficially similar to 1324, state prosecutorial discretion and judicial interpretation will undermine federal authority ‘to establish immigration enforcement priorities and strategies,’ " Thrash wrote, quoting the Arizona ruling. Murphy told us he respectfully disagrees with some portions of Thrash’s ruling and that the judge’s interpretation of the federal law is incorrect. Murphy questioned our pursuit of this fact-check, saying, in part, that we could find 100 experts who would agree with Thrash while he could find 100 experts who would agree with him. Still, we pressed on in search of more nonpartisan experts. One was Victor Cerda, former general counsel for the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. He argues Georgia’s E-Verify guidelines go beyond federal guidelines. For example, he noted that Georgia requires affidavits from contractors, subcontractors and sub-subcontractors of the immigration status of their workers. The federal government does not require an affidavit from contractors, an official said. Instead, contractors must sign a memorandum of understanding that they will use E-Verify within its guidelines. "Georgia has a lot more definition," said Cerda, now a partner in the Washington, D.C., office of the law firm Jackson Lewis, which specializes in workplace law. So let’s go back to Murphy’s argument that HB 87 "simply follows existing federal law." In the area of penalties, which are easier to measure, Georgia’s bill is less in some areas and potentially greater in other areas. The legislation addresses the same issues as federal law, but there are some differences where Georgia does more than simply follow federal law, such as Cerda’s point on affidavits and the language in Georgia’s bill concerning "inducing" illegal immigration here from another state. Since Murphy’s statement does not consider those distinctions, we rate his claim as Half True.	None	Jack Murphy	None	None	None	2011-07-18T06:00:00	2011-06-27	['None']
pomt-05971	Says Texas does not regulate the appearance of some kinds of imitation firearms sold in Texas.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/jan/24/eddie-lucio-jr/eddie-lucio-says-texas-does-not-regulate-appearanc/	A Democratic state senator called for regulations after police fatally shot a 15-year-old boy who was brandishing what turned out to be a non-lethal air pistol. In an interview posted online Jan. 6, 2012, by KRGV-TV, Channel 5, Eddie Lucio of Brownsville said: "First of all I think that there should be a prohibition of some kind on the appearance of these pellet guns and airsoft guns that are sold in the state of Texas." At least, Lucio said, such guns should visibly stand out so "we understand exactly what they are." In the same segment, reporter Eddie Flores said Lucio told him that "right now, there are no known regulations or prohibitions in the appearance of pellet guns or airsoft guns in the state of Texas." No regulations in Texas? When we inquired, Lucio’s legislative director, Sara González,said the senator intended to stress the lack of state, not federal, regulations of the facsimile firearms’ appearances. Airsoft guns, she said, are required by federal law to display a 6-millimeter orange tip, a mandate that doesn’t apply to pellet or BB guns. "What (Lucio) meant is there is nothing in the state that we know of," she said. "There’s federal regulation on airsoft guns, but that doesn’t apply necessarily to metal pellet-type guns or BB guns." In the Jan. 4, 2012, incident at a Brownsville middle school, the student was wielding a Umarex SA177, according to news accounts. The device solely fires steel BBs, Justin Biddle, a marketing manager at Umarex USA, told us in an interview. González helped us isolate the federal law that regulates the appearance of imitation firearms, stipulating the 6-millimeter orange marking requirement for airsoft guns. Those guns shoot projectiles at a lower speed than pellet or BB guns, according to Jeffrey Welty, an assistant professor of public law and government at the University of North Carolina School of Government, who specializes in criminal law and procedure. But the marking requirement does not apply to "traditional BB, paint-ball, or pellet-firing air guns that expel a projectile through the force of air pressure," the law says. So, the gun used in Brownsville was exempt from federal marking requirements. In the wake of the shooting, the office of Rep. Rene Oliveira, D-Brownsville, also examined legal issues related to facsimile firearms, said J.J. Garza, Oliveira’s chief of staff. Garza pointed us to another part of the U.S. Code, Section G, which states that federal provisions on imitation gun identification supersede such local or state laws and ordinances. But are there state and local restrictions anyway? Meagan Dorsch, a spokeswoman for the National Conference of State Legislatures, emailed us the organization’s July 2011 list showing states with imitation firearm statutes: Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, Tennessee and Wisconsin. We wondered how any state statutes survive without conflicting with the superseding federal law. By addressing aspects not included in the federal provisions, advised David Kopel, an expert on firearms policy and research director at the Independence Institute, a free-market think tank in Colorado. For instance, he said by email, "Louisiana’s statutes only applies to guns that fire blanks, and those aren't covered by the federal law." Separately, experts at the Texas Legislative Library said that some Texas cities, including Plano, Horseshoe Bay, Farmers Branch and Carrollton have local ordinances that regulate how people display facsimile firearms--no reckless displays of imitation guns in public places, for example--but these statutes don’t regulate the appearance of the guns. Our ruling There are no state-level regulations of the appearance of pellet/BB or airsoft guns sold in Texas, but federal law requires airsoft guns to have special markings -- a wrinkle Lucio did not clarify.

pomt-11377	Says U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis "voted in favor of food stamps for illegal immigrants."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/29/uncle-sams-misguided-children/misleading-attack-ron-desantis-about-farm-bill-foo/	Republican U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis, who has received support from President Donald Trump in his bid for Florida governor, favors giving a benefit to immigrants in the country illegally, says an article on Facebook. "DeSantis voted in favor of food stamps for illegal immigrants," stated a March 23 headline on Uncle Sam’s Misguided Children, a website that says it is a "community founded by United States Marine Veterans to bring awareness of the lame stream media." The article drew from the Central Florida Post, a right-leaning website. The Uncle Sam story said that DeSantis’ vote on the 2014 farm bill "ultimately puts illegal aliens and criminals ahead of law-abiding American citizens in line for food stamps — a judgment President Trump would surely question." (While Trump has said the "time has come" to restrict federal assistance to immigrants, that already exists.) We found that the Uncle Sam article omitted key context that immigrants in the country illegally were already banned from getting food stamps long before the 2014 farm bill, a sweeping package that only briefly mentions verifying immigration status. The article also ignored an explanation by DeSantis about why he voted against the farm bill. DeSantis is running in the August primary against a field that includes Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam. DeSantis vote on farm bill in 2014 A farm bill is passed about every five years, reauthorizing food and agriculture policy including measures such as crop and commodity subsidies, conservation programs, agriculture research and food stamps, known as SNAP for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The Uncle Sam story points to an article about DeSantis’ 2014 vote as one of 63 Republicans to join 103 Democrats voting against HR 2642, the farm bill. The legislation, which passed the House 251-166 and was signed into law by President Barack Obama, had drawn opposition from both sides: Some liberals said the cuts were too steep while some conservatives said it didn’t do enough to cut spending. While the legislation was hundreds of pages, only a few sentences related to illegal immigrants. Section 4015 stated "a state agency shall be required to use an immigration status verification system." That provision drew scant media attention. Some news stories mentioned in a single sentence that the farm bill banned illegal immigrants, college students, lottery winners and dead people from getting food stamps. Another reason the immigration section may not have been a key part of the debate? Federal law already generally banned immigrants in the country illegally from getting food stamps. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 restricted access for immigrants to get food stamps. But subsequent legislation restored access for certain immigrants, including refugees and lawful permanent residents with a proven work history. While the 2014 farm bill required states to use an immigration status verification system, most states already had procedures in place to meet that requirement. Nune Phillips, a policy analyst at the Center for Law and Social Policy, which advocates on behalf of low-income people, said the farm bill didn’t change immigrant eligibility rules for food and nutrition assistance. "Undocumented immigrants are not currently, and never have been, eligible for SNAP. To qualify for SNAP, applicants must be U.S. citizens or be eligible, lawfully-present noncitizens," he said. Why DeSantis voted against the farm bill The section on immigration wasn’t the motivation behind DeSantis’ vote against the farm bill. He voted against the bill because of the high costs. He believed that the bill failed to overhaul a food stamp program that was growing too large, said campaign spokesman Brad Herold. In a 2014 Facebook post, DeSantis said the farm bill was a "bad deal for taxpayers and contains little in the way of meaningful reforms," such as work requirements. Herold said DeSantis does not believe in granting any form of benefits to immigrants in the country illegally. He has voted in favor of amendments related to work requirements for food stamps. But the 2014 farm bill didn’t alter the pre-existing policy that illegal benefits are not eligible for SNAP benefits. "Voting against a bill that expanded farm subsidies and failed to enact welfare reforms is not a vote to confer benefits on illegal immigrants," Herold said. Jacob Engels, publisher of the Central Florida Post and author of the article inked from the Uncle Sam website, directed PolitiFact to an article by the Center for Immigration Studies, an organization that advocates for low levels of immigration. The story was more nuanced, saying that a family that has some citizens and some immigrants in the country illegally could still get some benefits. Our ruling Uncle Sam’s Misguided Children said that DeSantis "voted in favor of food stamps for illegal immigrants." The article fails to point out that even before the farm bill passed, undocumented immigrants were already generally blocked from getting food stamps. The farm bill that DeSantis voted against was a sweeping piece of legislation that mentions immigrants only briefly in the context of requiring states to verify their status. DeSantis stated at the time of his vote against the bill that he thought it was a bad deal for taxpayers and failed to rein in the food stamp program. By voting "no" he took a stand against the overall piece of legislation — that’s not evidence that he "voted in favor of food stamps for illegal immigrants." We rate this claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-05205	"When I started in Ohio it was terrible. Now, we’re getting bipartisan support for our bills. And that’s called leadership."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/jun/11/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-says-his-leadership-has-led-more-b/	Editor's note: This item was updated to correct a vote total for the 2011 budget vote in the Ohio House. John Kasich doesn’t like playing second fiddle, but when he was on "Meet the Press" on June 3, that’s pretty much what he was doing. The Republican governor was on the show facing off against Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts to argue as proxies on the relative merits of the candidates for president. Hoping to give a boost to GOP nominee Mitt Romney, Kasich laid into President Barack Obama’s argument that Republicans in Congress are blocking his moves at every turn and undercutting his agenda. Citing his own experience in Ohio, Kasich said the key is to take the "terrible" politics in Washington D.C. and forge a bipartisan road. "When I started in Ohio, it was terrible," he told host David Gregory. "We’re now getting bipartisan support for our bills. And that's called leadership." Was Kasich right? PolitiFact Ohio looked at a previous claim by Kasich in 2011 that there had been some "significant" bipartisan accomplishments during his first year in office and rated that True. But this statement was more sweeping. PolitiFact Ohio decided to pull the voting records and see what they showed. We started out by determining what bills could be fairly described as Kasich administration initiatives as opposed to something lawmakers may have wanted to do. After consulting with an informal trio of PolitiFact Ohio Statehouse reporters, we came up with eight key bills in Kasich’s first year that are fairly described as his babies: the state operating budget, the state transportation budget, the JobsOhio economic development board bill, a business regulation reform bill, a sentencing reform bill, a collective bargaining reform bill (known as Senate Bill 5), a bill cracking down on pill mills and a measure allowing oil and gas drilling in state parks. Before revealing the results, we should note that Kasich’s fellow Republicans hold the advantage over Democrats in both the House (59-40) and the Senate (23-10). So for those eight bills from 2011, we found that on the average, they received 17 House Democratic votes out of a possible 40 and four Senate Democratic votes of a possible 10. On half of the votes in the House, the Kasich bills received three or fewer votes -- which is less than 10 percent of the Democratic votes that could have been obtained. And half of the time in the Senate, the Kasich bills received no Senate votes. Among the bills receiving scant support from either Democratic caucus were the controversial collective bargaining reform legislation, which no Democrats voted for, and Kasich’s state budget, which received only three House Democratic votes. Next, we looked at bills that Kasich has pushed in his second year as governor. After again consulting our informal panel, we came up with seven key bills Kasich has been the driving force behind in 2012. They are the collateral sanctions bill, a Lake Erie water usage bill, a second JobsOhio economic development package as well as four bills that were part of what Kasich called his mid-budget review, or MBR. The MBR bills were wide-ranging rewrites of Ohio law or leftover initiatives which the Kasich administration wasn’t ready to roll out in his main state budget in 2011 covering education, energy, tax policy and a catch-all bill covering various areas of administration policy. For those seven bills, we found on the average that Kasich received 26 House Democratic votes out of a possible 40 and five Senate Democratic votes out of a possible 10. (Please note that those averages are based on six votes per chamber as each chamber hasn’t voted on one of the seven bills listed.) With the exception of the Lake Erie water use bill, which received a single Democratic vote in the House, we found that Kasich received at least 16 House Democratic votes for all of his other initiatives. In the Senate, Kasich’s bills in 2012 didn’t get much more support than his bills in 2011, although he was blanked only once instead of four times. Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols said the clearest example of Kasich’s point is to compare the state budget vote in 2011 (no Democratic votes in either the House or the Senate) to the mid-budget review package of 2012 (an average of 23 House Democratic votes and five Senate Democratic votes). "Things are much better than they were back then," he said in terms of getting bipartisan support. So where does this leave us as the dust settled? When Kasich appeared on "Meet the Press" to bash Obama, he wanted to draw a sharp contrast between the gridlock in Washington and what he sees as his record in Ohio. He said that when he started in Ohio, the political atmosphere was "terrible" but "now we’re getting bipartisan support for our bills." Our math does show that Kasich is getting more support for his key bills in 2012 than when he began his term -- 26 House Democratic votes compared to 16 and five Senate Democratic votes instead of four. Furthermore, the Democratic shutouts for Kasich have dropped off sharply in his second year. However, Kasich appears to have overstated the Democratic opposition to his initiatives when he came into office in 2011. It is true that almost all Democrats opposed his state budget, and no Democrats voted for the controversial rewrite of Ohio’s collective bargaining laws, but at least some Democrats supported most of the other initiatives sought by Kasich in 2011. We find that to be additional information that puts Kasich’s statement into a clearer context. On the Truth-O-Meter, Kasich’s statement rates Mostly True.

pomt-01401	"We know from the social science that children do best with a mom and a dad."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/oct/12/tony-perkins/tony-perkins-we-know-social-science-children-do-be/	The Supreme Court’s refusal this week to review any of the same-sex marriage cases that had been sent for appeal undercut such bans in several states. Supporters of gay marriage celebrated the move. Opponents criticized it as further proof that "unelected judges" have the power to overrule the will of the majority. Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a leading group in the fight against gay marriage, said children’s welfare is central to the council’s position. "We know from the social science that children do best with a mom and a dad," Perkins said Oct. 12 on Fox News Sunday. We have examined this sort of claim before. The independent research fails to back up Perkins’ view. The Family Research Council has a Web page with 10 arguments from social science against same-sex marriage. We went through the list to see which spoke to the welfare of children, and of those points, which were based on studies that compared children in same-sex and opposite-sex households. Not addressing the welfare of children Five of the 10 had more to do with marriage and society than children. They advanced claims that opposite-sex marriage promotes the domestication of men, paternal commitment, sexual fidelity, "gender-typical" roles and the association of marriage with procreation. A sixth one spoke of how children conceived through artificial insemination "hunger" to know about their biological fathers. While those questions no doubt occur, the book cited by the Family Research Council focused largely on what fathers can bring to child-rearing. It was more a guide to fathering, and less a comparison study of different kinds of households. In fact, it wasn’t a peer-reviewed comparison study at all. The remaining four pieces of evidence That leaves four items on the Family Research Council list. One asserted that children need fathers and cited a study on households where the father is absent. However, that research looked at single-parent households, not children with same-sex parents, and so it addresses a different issue entirely. The Web page offers the corollary point that children need mothers. It cites books, not academic studies, and again, the books are not focused on comparing same-sex and opposite-sex households. They look at gender differences and how children develop over time. The final two points from the Family Research Council address the data on children of same-sex households. You can find many research papers that claim that growing up in same-sex households does no harm. But the council cited the court affidavit of a University of Virginia professor who said that not one of those studies "was conducted according to generally accepted standards of scientific research." That testimony has been critiqued on two scores: It came in 2001 and research has passed it by, and it overlooked a range of studies. But even if the methodological critique were correct, it wouldn’t prove that growing up in an opposite-sex household is better. The council then cited the work of New York University sociologist Judith Stacey to make the point that children raised in same-sex households "are more likely to experience gender and sexual disorders." When we looked at this topic before, Stacey said this represents a "complete misuse of the research." Stacey wrote that the differences she described, such as children being more open to same-sex relationships, need not be seen as deficits. Stacey accused same-sex marriage opponents of cherry-picking her findings. What other research shows We did find one study funded by conservative organizations as showing gay parents are worse than straight ones, but it was denounced by the American Sociological Association, the researcher’s own university and many reputable sociologists. In conducting the study, the researcher loosely defined same-sex couples and, in doing so, only spoke with two children who were actually raised by gay parents. In contrast, we found several research projects that compared much larger numbers of children in same and opposite-sex households. One published in 2012 looked at 78 children -- about half boys and half girls -- raised by lesbian parents. The mothers joined the research project as far back as 1986, long before their children were born. The children were assessed over time and those results were matched to children from heterosexual couples. When asked about how they felt about themselves, their relations with their parents and with their peers, the children of lesbians responded much as did the children of straight parents. However, they were more likely to report being teased at school because of their parents. The American Psychological Association produced a comprehensive review of studies going back three decades. The most relevant section focuses on research that compares the children of lesbian or gay parents. The studies looked at children in terms of their school performance, their relations with their peers, intelligence, self-esteem and a number of other variables. According to this review, "the belief that children of lesbian and gay parents suffer deficits in personal development has no empirical foundation." Our ruling Perkins said that based on social science, we know "that children do best with a mom and a dad." The research cited on the website of Perkins’ group, the Family Research Council, does not provide any support. It relies on books rather than peer-reviewed research, it quotes selectively or mischaracterizes from the work it cites, or at best, challenges the quality of the methodology behind findings that go against its position. In contrast, we found recent peer-reviewed social science research that finds that at the very least, children of lesbian parents do as well as other children. We rate Perkins’ claim False.

pomt-14119	"Jason Kander supports [Obama’s] plan to bring the remaining suspected terrorists to U.S. soil."	false	/missouri/statements/2016/may/09/roy-blunt/sen-blunt-misstates-opponent-jason-kanders-positio/	The race for Missouri’s U.S. senate seat is heating up between incumbent Sen. Roy Blunt and Secretary of State Jason Kander. Blunt said Kander supports President Obama’s plan to close Guantanamo Bay, a U.S. military prison in Cuba housing suspected terrorists, and transfer prisoners to mainland prisons. Blunt tweeted out a petition against the plan 11 times on his campaign account between April 18 and April 20. The petition says, "Jason Kander supports his plan to bring the remaining suspected terrorists to U.S. soil. Tell national Democrats and Jason Kander that bringing suspected terrorists to U.S. soil puts Missouri families at risk." This statement piqued our interest, because Kander made headlines in February for coming out against this plan. So we decided to look into the claim. Obama has tried to close Gitmo ever since he took office in 2009. The Missouri House passed a resolution later that year that opposed the closure. It urged Congress to "reject any act of asylum, containment, transport, imprisonment, or medical care in regard to suspected terrorists from any United States operated foreign prison present within the State of Missouri." Kander, who was serving as a state representative at the time, voted against this resolution. At the end of February of this year, the White House again released a plan for closing the detention center. Part of the plan includes transferring detainees who cannot be released in foreign countries to a U.S. prison facility. One of the proposed facilities is a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, which sits a few miles from the Kansas-Missouri border. Kander released a statement opposing this plan after it was announced by the president. "Our focus right now needs to be defeating ISIS, and we can’t risk the possibility that the terrorists housed at Guantanamo could rejoin the battlefield," said Kander. "These dangerous prisoners should not be transferred to the United States, and I strongly urge President Obama to reconsider this plan." His spokesman Chris Hayden said Kander has never supported legislation on the federal level to close Gitmo and has opposed executive action. "He did not think that a non-binding resolution in the Missouri legislature was the best way to keep us safe from terrorists," Hayden said. Blunt has accused Kander of flip-flopping on the issue. Tate O’Connor, spokesperson for Blunt’s campaign said, "Jason Kander may wish to un-ring the bell, but he cannot." He said Kander is only trying to appeal to Missouri’s popular vote by opposing Obama’s plan. But Kander never officially stated his position on closing Gitmo until February. Even the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which seeks to get Republicans elected to the Senate, released a video last November saying the committee couldn’t find his stance on bringing the prisoners to the U.S. Blunt is going against the message from his fellow Republicans when he says Kander supported Obama’s plan in the past. Our Ruling Blunt says Kander supports Obama’s plan to bring the remaining prisoners at Guantanamo Bay to the U.S. Kander voted against a 2009 resolution in the Missouri legislature that called on Congress to keep the facility open. But that doesn’t mean he supported Obama’s plan to close the prison. He took no official position until February, and even the National Republican Senatorial Committee said they weren’t sure where he stood before then. We rate this statement as False.

pomt-02845	Says Mark Pryor "cut Medicare to pay for Obamacare."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/19/tom-cotton/sen-mark-pryor-cut-medicare-pay-obamacare-says-rep/	So far, PolitiFact has heard some familiar attacks in the 2014 midterm election campaign rhetoric. The latest comes from the Arkansas Senate race, where incumbent Mark Pryor, a Democrat, faces U.S. Rep. Tom Cotton, a Republican. Recently, they traded jabs over Medicare funding. "Some politicians like Tom Cotton voted to cut Social Security, turn Medicare into a voucher system and raise the age of eligibility to 70," Pryor’s ad said. "Pryor cut Medicare to pay for Obamacare," Cotton’s ad shot back. We’ve addressed Pryor’s claim in a separate fact-check. Here, we’ll focus on Cotton’s assertion that the Affordable Care Act strips Medicare funding. Cotton’s office didn’t respond to our requests for comment, but we did hear from Pryor’s folks. We’re certainly no stranger to different versions of this claim. There is a connection between the Affordable Care Act and cuts to Medicare funding. Both parties have recognized a need to rein in Medicare costs, which were growing at an annual rate of 6.8 percent in 2010, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. "Without reform, the nation’s already excessive health care spending would have reached unsustainable levels within the next few decades," the 2010 CMS report read. With the enactment of the health care law, Medicare’s growth was projected to slow to 5.3 percent, according to the same CMS report. Over time, CMS predicts this will result in a 10-year savings of more than $700 billion. The savings will come from reductions to Medicare Advantage, which represents a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. In additions, hospitals will be paid less if they don’t meet certain benchmarks for patient care. The law’s intent was to save money by making the system more efficient and without making reductions in benefits. So Obamacare doesn’t "cut" Medicare funding that already exists. Rather, it controls future spending, which politicians on both sides of the aisle called for. The cost control "is part of what Congress does to try to manage the insanely complex and expensive Medicare system," said Jay Wolfson, a public health professor at the University of South Florida. "It is not new, nor is it partisan." When Mark Pryor voted with the Senate to pass Obamacare in 2009, he wasn’t voting to cut Medicare. He was voting to slow its growth. The goal is to reallocate some of the money saved toward Obamacare’s goal of covering the currently uninsured, said Timothy Jost, a Washington and Lee University health policy law professor. So the savings are designed to offset costs in Obamacare so that the law doesn’t increase the national deficit. Our ruling Cotton’s ad claimed that "Pryor cut Medicare to pay for Obamacare." In reality, the Affordable Care Act calls for a slowed growth of Medicare funding, not a slash to current funds. The savings from this approach will be used to offset Obamacare costs. Because the ad doesn’t make this clear, we rate Cotton’s claim Half True.

pomt-14878	"Welders make more money than philosophers."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/11/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-welders-more-money-philosophers/	Florida Senator Marco Rubio is a fan of vocational training. At the Fox Business Network GOP debate in Milwaukee, Rubio made a pitch for young Americans to put down the textbooks and pick up a blowtorch. "For the life of me, I don’t know why we have stigmatized vocational training," Rubio said. "Welders make more money than philosophers. We need more welders and less philosophers." It was a big moment for Rubio, but was he correct? Philosophically and statistically speaking, no. It’s hard to know exactly how many philosophers there are in America, as many don’t have the title "philosopher" in their job descriptions. For this fact-check, we will look at those who majored in philosophy in college. According to Payscale, a company that collects salary information, philosophy majors make an average first-year salary of $42,200. The average mid-career pay for philosophy majors is even better: $85,000 per year. Additionally, the median pay for philosophy professors is nearly $90,000 per year, according to salary.com. The top 10 percent of philosophy professors make more than $190,000 a year. Rubio will be hard-pressed to find a welder who makes a comparable salary. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median wage for welders, cutters, solderers and brazers is $37,420 -- about $18 an hour. The top 10 percent of welders earn $58,590 or more. That’s significantly less than the top 10 percent of philosophy professors, who earn $190,000 or more. We haven’t heard back from the Rubio campaign yet, but it’s possible that Rubio read something along the lines of this 2014 Wall Street Journal column, which cites a few cases in which welders bring home annual salaries exceeding $150,000. While this might be the case for some extremely high-level welders -- just as some philosophy professors make significantly more money than others -- the labor and salary data suggests these cases are the exception, not the norm. Our ruling Rubio said, "Welders make more money than philosophers." It made for a great sound bite, but neither salary nor labor statistics back up Rubio’s claim. Statistically, philosophy majors make more money than welders -- with much more room to significantly increase pay throughout their careers. It’s clear that Rubio was making a pitch for more vocational training in the United States, but his claim on welders doesn't hold together. As Aristotle said, "The least initial deviation from the truth is multiplied later a thousandfold." We rate Rubio’s claim False.

pomt-01014	"Did you know under President Obama family health care premiums have increased $4,154 on the average?"	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2015/feb/02/barbara-comstock/comstock-says-family-health-policies-have-increase/	"Did you know under President Obama family health care premiums have increased $4,154 on the average?" U.S. Rep. Barbara Comstock, R-10th, recently tweeted. We didn’t know that. So we gave it a look. Other claims using the same number have popped up on a number GOP websites across the country. Comstock and others say the $4,154 figure comes from an annual report on employer health benefits that was published by the Kaiser Family Foundation on Sept. 10, 2014. Kaiser’s findings were based on a survey of more than 2,000 businesses of all sizes across the nation about their health insurance costs. On Page 31 is a chart that details the average annual premiums for single and family coverage for work-based health care plans since 1999. The chart shows that in 2008, the average cost for family coverage -- shared by the company and the employee -- was $12,680. In 2014, it was $16,834. According to Comstock, that means there’s been a $4,154 increase under Obama. But there’s a problem with that computation. Obama didn’t take office until Jan. 20, 2009. Kaiser’s 2008 survey was based on responses companies gave from January to May 2008 about their health plans, some of which were contracted before the survey began. In other words, Comstock is holding Obama responsible for some premium increases that occurred during the presidency of George W. Bush. If we use the 2009 Kaiser report to start to start counting premium increases under Obama -- and even here, some of the hikes still would have occurred when Bush was president -- the bottom line drops. The average family premium was $13,375 in 2009 .The increase between then and 2014 would be $3,459. While Kaiser charts annual average premiums, it makes no attempt to attach the numbers to individual presidents. Craig Palosky, a spokesman for the non-partisan research foundation, declined to comment on Comstock’s claim or offer guidance on the political relevance of data in the report. "I’d like the survey to speak for itself," he said. Some perspective The $4,154 increase since 2008 that Comstock hangs on Obama is a big number. So is the $3,459 average increase in family premiums since 2009, when Obama took office. But these figures need context. Kaiser, in a news release last September summarizing its 2014 report, said the trend on employer-based family premiums over the last five years is good news. "Premiums increased more slowly over the past five years than the preceding five years (25 percent to 34 percent) and well below the annual double-digit increases recorded in the late 1990s and early 2000s," Kaiser wrote. Comstock, in blaming Obama for rising insurance costs, omits a key qualification: Family premiums offered by employers increased at a faster inflation-adjusted pace during the Bush years than they have under Obama. If we use 2009 as the baseline for Obama, then, as we’ve said, family average premiums rose from $13,375 to $16,834 in 2014. That’s an increase of $3,459. Adjusted for inflation, the price went up 10.3 percent. Looking back over the last six full years of the Bush administration, average family premiums rose from $9,068 in 2003 to $12,680 in 2008. That was an increase of $3,612. Adjusted for inflation, the price went up 19.5 percent. The Kaiser survey, while offering a universe of statistics on employer-based insurance, contains little explanation of trends. Kaiser doesn’t offer an opinion whether the Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare, is playing a major role in the slowing of family premiums. The report notes that a major feature of the ACA -- a mandate requiring companies with 50 or more full time employees to offer health insurance or pay a federal fine -- is starting to kick in this year. We spoke to two health care experts and they both largely attributed the slowed rise in premiums to the nation’s slow recovery from the Great Recession. "To some degree, inflation has abated and so has medical inflation," said Paul Fronstin, a senior analyst with the Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington. Another reason for the slowed premium growth, they said, is that employees are paying a greater share of their health care costs through out-of-pocket deductibles for doctor appointments and hospital stays. Our ruling "Did you know under President Obama family health care premiums have increased $4,154 on the average?" Comstock tweeted. She attributed her figure to the Kaiser Foundation’s 2014 survey on employer-based health insurance policies. First, the number is dubious. Kaiser doesn’t t assign statistics in its report to any president. To get to $4,154, Comstock uses Kaiser’s 2008 survey as the base year for Obama. That means she’s blaming Obama for some premiums that went into effect a year or more before he was inaugurated. If we use 2009 as the base year -- when Obama took office -- the increase is $3,459 and even this average would include some policies that were contracted before his presidency began. Second, Comstock’s charge lacks context. By just throwing out a number, the congresswoman suggests the premiums are spiraling. In fact, Kaiser says the rate of increase in the cost of employer-based family policies has slowed during the last five years. We rate Comstock’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-11582	"Fall River, Massachusetts was not 'built by immigrants.' "	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/feb/01/breitbart/following-joe-kennedys-speech-breitbart-says-fall-/	In his Democratic response to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address, U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy III talked about the immigrant roots of a city in his Boston-area district. "We are here in Fall River, Massachusetts, a proud American city," Kennedy said, speaking from a vocational technical high school. "An American city built by immigrants." Breitbart, a conservative website formerly run by Steve Bannon who served as Trump’s strategist, fired back at Kennedy’s description of the city. "No, Fall River, Massachusetts was not 'built by immigrants,' " stated the headline. "Fact-Check: Mostly False." We decided to do a fact-check of our own of Breitbart’s claim. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found the Breitbart story glosses over the role of immigrants in the city’s history. As evidence, Breitbart wrote that Fall River was established in the 1600s by English settlers "who were not ‘immigrants’ but colonists." Breitbart wrote that a native-born family, the Bordens, ran a mill in what became the town before and after the American Revolutionary War. Industrialization began when Col. Joseph Durfee, a native-born Revolutionary War hero built the first factory in 1811. Breitbart said that immigrants arrived at the end of the 19th century. Breitbart has a point that English settlers arrived before other immigrant groups, but when the town truly took off due to the textile mills, it was waves of immigrant labor that fueled the growth. We interviewed Bridgewater State University professor Philip Silvia who wrote his dissertation on local history, The Spindle City: Labor, Politics and Religion in Fall River (1870-1905). Silvia has taught courses on Fall River’s immigrant and labor history. Fall River was settled by English immigrants in the 1600s when few people lived in the area, Silvia said. But ultimately, "it attracted immigrants like no other place," Silvia said. Fall River became prominent in the 19th century when textile factories were constructed. The mills drew various waves of immigrants from different nationalities, including the English and the Irish. Fall River incorporated as a town in 1803 and as a city in 1854. The real surge occurred after the Civil War when Fall River became the pre-eminent textile city in the United States, fueling a massive influx of immigrant workers. A gigantic wave came from French Canada, the largest immigrant group for decades. "Technically one could argue it wasn’t immigrants supplying the capital who built the mills, but without workers, the mills would not have succeeded as they did," Silvia said. Breitbart pointed to immigrant statistics in 1910 and wrote that immigrants "never made up a majority of the population of Bristol County, where Fall River lies, even at their early 20th Century peak." But Silvia, who wrote his dissertation on the topic, said that by 1875, more than half of the population was foreign born. By the 1870s, three-quarters of the mill population were immigrants and that population climbed even higher. Eventually immigrants included those who were Portuguese, Italian, Polish, Jewish and Scottish. Later waves came from Vietnam and Cambodia. Around 1900, there were 18 ethnic groups in the city. "It is an immigrant city," he said. Kennedy’s spokesman pointed to an article by the local newspaper that covers Fall River, The Herald News, documenting visible signs around the city that show its immigrant history. "From the Fabergé egg-shaped bell towers of St. Anne’s Church to the Portuguese bakeries that line Columbia Street, Fall River would not be Fall River without its immigrants...," stated the newspaper following Breitbart’s article about Kennedy’s speech. "Fall River’s notable churches and many of its landmarks were built by the people who began arriving on its streets in the mid-19th century from Ireland, Canada, Italy, Lebanon, Poland and Portugal, and in recent years from Brazil, Syria, Haiti, Cambodia and elsewhere." As of 2016, about 18 percent of the city’s population of 90,000 is foreign born, according to the U.S. Census. We attempted to reach Breitbart and did not get a reply. Breitbart wrote that, "Fall River, Massachusetts was not 'built by immigrants.' " English settlers first established Fall River in the 1600s when it was sparsely populated. But Breitbart gives short shrift to the role waves of immigrants played in growing the community as it turned into a prominent textile city in the 1800s. We rate this claim False.

pomt-02656	"If you have a job in this country, (there's a) 97 percent chance that you're not going to be in poverty."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/14/steve-southerland/rep-steve-southerland-r-fla-says-97-percent-those-/	Five decades after President Lyndon B. Johnson launched the War on Poverty, Fox News Sunday invited Rep. Steve Southerland, R-Fla., among others, to discuss the anniversary. Host John Roberts asked Southerland about ending current programs and moving to a system of block grants: "You said, looking back on Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, it has failed and failed miserably. Do you keep putting more money into existing programs or do you -- as Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) suggested earlier this week -- fundamentally reform everything, (taking) a big pot of money that the federal government has and (giving) that to the states to administer in innovative ways?" Southerland responded, "I think you have to look at the indicators -- the fundamentals of these programs. Look what causes poverty. We know that two-parent families (are) a child's greatest opportunity to avoid poverty. We know that a good quality education with daily parent involvement … reduces poverty. … If you have a job in this country, (there’s a) 97 percent chance that you're not going to be in poverty. And so, therefore, I think there's a better way." Several readers asked us to check Southerland’s claim that if you have a job, there’s a "97 percent chance" that you're not going to be in poverty. We found Census Bureau data from 2012 that supports his claim. The Census Bureau found that 2.9 percent of Americans between 18 and 64 who worked full-time, year-round in 2012 were in poverty. However, we’ll note a caveat. Southerland said "if you have a job" -- and there are people in the United States who have jobs, but not full-time, full-year jobs. Among Americans age 18 to 64 who have part-time jobs, the poverty rate is 16.6 percent. And among all workers -- Americans who have either a full- or a part-time job -- the rate is 7.3 percent. So a more accurate number for the likelihood of poverty "if you have a job" is 92.7 percent, or, rounding up, 93 percent. That’s very close to 97 percent, but slightly off. "While the percentages may vary slightly from one year to the next, independent sources make clear that your chances of living in poverty increase more than ten-fold if you don’t have a steady, full-time job," said Matt McCullough, a spokesman for Southerland. A final point: The census figures show that nearly 2.9 million people worked full time for the whole year yet still ended up below the poverty line. That may only be 2.9 percent of all full-time workers, but it’s still a whole lot of people working, yet still ending up below the poverty line. Our ruling Southerland said, "If you have a job in this country, (there's a) 97 percent chance that you're not going to be in poverty." That’s true only for full-time jobs. If you include both full-time jobs and part-time jobs, then the percentage drops slightly, to 93 percent. On balance, we rate his claim Mostly True.

Thanks Chief Fernandez!"	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/apr/22/broward-county-police-benevolent-association/hollywood-had-more-homicides-any-other-city-browar/	The police union in Hollywood has launched a high-profile battle in an effort to oust Chief Frank Fernandez, and they have literally taken their message to the sky. In March, the Police Benevolent Association floated a banner from an airplane that flew over the beach and downtown that declared, "Hollywood a high crime area. Thanks Chief Fernandez!" Then on April 15, the PBA posted a billboard on Pembroke Road that stated: "Hollywood is #1 in Broward homicides in 2013. Thanks Chief Fernandez!" We decided to investigate whether the homicide statistic is accurate and if Fernandez can be blamed for it. Hollywood police department battles To understand the backdrop of the billboard requires a bit of history about the years of feuds between city officials and police union leaders in this city of 145,000. In 2011, the city declared financial urgency and cut officers’ pay, which led to protests from the union and officer turnover. Fernandez became the city’s assistant city manager overseeing public safety in 2012 and chief in 2013, and he’s been tasked with trying to turn around the long-troubled department. Though Hollywood has a popular beach front that draws tourists and snowbirds, it’s also had some famous scandals in recent years. In 2007, a handful of officers convicted in a scheme that included selling heroin to undercover agents posing as mobsters. (The chief at the time was accused of leaking information about the probe before the arrests, forcing the FBI to bring it to a close prematurely.) A separate group of officers drew national attention in 2009 after one of them crashed into a vehicle, and video captured employees saying they would "do a little Walt Disney" to protect the officer and doctor a police report. News reports in the Sun-Sentinel indicate Fernandez has had some success: He has increased recruiting, made physical improvements to the police station and brought a close to contract negotiations. Fernandez also brought in outside consultants to audit the agency, and they found problems with its use-of-force policy, missing internal affairs files and forgotten rape kits, the Sun-Sentinel reported. The union disputes the audit and says it was written by a hired consultant tasked with finding fault. The billboard is the latest round in the battle between the police union and city leaders who say it’s just another ploy. Hollywood crime statistics Jeff Marano, president of the police union, sent us Hollywood crime statistics from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The data showed homicides in the city rose from five in 2012 to 16 in 2013. A spokeswoman for the city didn’t dispute the numbers but said they come with some caveats. First, the homicides were either drug- or gang-related or domestics, Raelin Storey said. "There were not random acts of murder taking place in the city of Hollywood," she said. The reasons behind the homicides aren’t the point, Marano said. "A homicide is a homicide," he said. "It’s a dead person." Assessing whether the number of homicides placed Hollywood in the No. 1 slot in Broward was more complicated because statewide data for 2013 hasn’t been published yet. (Marano said he determined Hollywood was the highest by speaking with a Hollywood homicide detective who speaks with his counterparts at other departments.) So we decided to do our own research and contact law enforcement agencies in Broward County to ask them to supply the number of homicides in their city in 2013. We mostly focused our search on the larger cities or the ones that had more than five homicides in 2012. The results: Hollywood: 16 Fort Lauderdale: 13 Pompano Beach: 8 Lauderhill: 6 Lauderdale Lakes: 5 Oakland Park: 5 Miramar: 4 Pembroke Pines: 0 We did not find any city that had a higher number of homicides than Hollywood in Broward. Not surprisingly, the city pointed to statistics that give residents a more favorable impression of safety in their city. The data from FDLE showed other serious offenses, which include sexual assaults, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary and larceny and motor vehicle thefts. In total, those offenses dropped 13 percent in Hollywood in 2013. FDLE data showed that the crime rate dropped from 5,869 in 2012 to 5,050.9 in 2013. Experts pick apart union’s billboard We sent the union’s statement and the city’s recent murder statistics to a few criminologists. Several experts told us that when examining small numbers from one year to the next, a jump can appear significant even when it’s not. To draw meaningful conclusions requires looking at several years of data and examining the nature of the homicides. "Homicides are rare events in Hollywood, and as such the rates can bounce around quite a bit," said James Lynch, chair of the criminology department at the University of Maryland and former director of the federal government’s Bureau of Justice Statistics. We asked Marano to explain why the union pinned the number of homicides on the chief. Marano cited the chief’s "poor leadership" and deployment of officers, specifically "not enough officers assigned to street level crimes." But the experts we interviewed rejected the idea that the chief was to blame for the number of murders in one year. "Let’s assume the facts are correct," said Robert Friedmann, a professor emeritus of criminal justice at Georgia State University. "So does that mean blame chief for it? Unless the chief is the one who shoots the people, I would say absolutely not." While there are steps police departments can take in an effort to reduce crime, there are several factors -- including neighborhood and economic conditions and drug and gang activity -- that influence the number of murders in a city in a given year. Those conditions are entirely or largely out of the control of the police, said Ronald L. Akers, a criminology professor at the University of Florida. "We like to attribute declines in crime rates in a community to good police work, but there is not strong evidence to support that," Akers said. "Similarly, one may want to attribute increases in crime to bad police work or an ineffective police department, but again, where is the evidence to support that? What have the police done any differently in 2013? What if the number of murders come down again in 2014?" Our ruling The police union’s billboard states, "Hollywood is #1 in Broward homicides in 2013. Thanks Chief Fernandez!" Hollywood had 16 homicides in 2013, and we could not find any city that had any more homicides than Hollywood. While the number is correct, the union cherry-picked crime statistics to find one that puts the city in the worst light. At this point, we have no idea if the number is part of a trend or an aberration. We also know that overall, crime decreased. The billboard places the blame on Chief Fernandez, but criminologists say the chief can’t be blamed for the number of murders, especially when it is such a small number. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-06456	"Obamacare is so flat-out unpopular, that even the Obama administration chose to reject part of Obamacare last Friday, when they tried to throw out the CLASS Act, which is the long-term care function."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/19/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-hits-obama-administration-ending-/	Michele Bachmann continued to make the case against the health care law supported by President Barack Obama and most Democrats during the Republican debate in Las Vegas on Oct. 18, 2011. "Obamacare is so flat-out unpopular that even the Obama administration chose to reject part of Obamacare last Friday, when they tried to throw out the CLASS Act, which is the long-term care function," Bachmann said. "Secretary (Kathleen) Sebelius, who is the head of Health and Human Services, reported that the government can't even afford that part and has to throw it out. And now the administration is arguing with itself," she added. "When even the Obama administration wants to repeal this bill, I think we're going to win this thing. We're going to repeal it! And I will!" Here, we’re fact-checking Bachmann’s statement, "Obamacare is so flat-out unpopular, that even the Obama administration chose to reject part of Obamacare last Friday, when they tried to throw out the CLASS Act, which is the long-term care function." Bachmann gets a few things right here, but she also gives a misleading impression that the overall law’s popularity prompted the administration’s decision. But first let’s start with what the CLASS Act does. The problem the CLASS Act tries to address is how to pay for either nursing home care or in-home care for people who are functionally limited but do not require hospitalization. Right now, Medicare -- the health insurance program for Americans over age 65 -- usually does not pay for long-term nursing home care, and families can struggle to find appropriate help. The acronym stands for Community Living Assistance Services and Supports, and it was created as part of the health care law. It was intended as a stand-alone government-run program to help defray the cost of long-term care. In some ways, the program was intended to act like a traditional insurance program -- the insured people pay premiums and then draw the benefits only if they need them. (If you have the appetite for it, read this detailed analysis on the differences between CLASS and traditional long-term care insurance.) The late Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., championed the program for years, and it was through his efforts that the program was attached to the health care law. But the CLASS program looks to have fizzled. As Bachmann stated, on Oct. 14, 2011, U.S.Secretary of Health Human Services Kathleen Sebelius announced the program was not going forward, because it could not meet a legal requirement that the program be self-sustaining. (The insurance industry's term for this is "actuarially sound.") "For 19 months, experts inside and outside of government have examined how HHS might implement a financially sustainable, voluntary, and self-financed long-term care insurance program under the law that meets the needs of those seeking protection for the near term and those planning for the future," Sebelius wrote in a letter to Congress. "The work has been groundbreaking in many ways and has taught us a great deal ... But despite our best analytical efforts, I do not see a viable path forward for CLASS implementation at this time." The problem that the program ran into was that people wouldn't join the program unless they were likely to need benefits, which meant costs would have exceeded contributions, said Richard Kaplan, an expert on elder law at the University of Illinois who has studied the CLASS program. "This was only going to appeal to people who were extraordinarily risk averse or who were already ill," he said. The requirement that the program pay for itself was actually an amendment put into the law by then-Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H. Gregg is now an adviser to the investment bank Goldman Sachs, but he gave an interview on the end of the CLASS Act to the Washington Post's Sarah Kliff on Oct. 18. "I didn’t like the idea of setting up the program. But with this, it was either going to have to work or come down as a result of the amendment," Gregg said. As for the Obama administration ending the program, "I don’t think they really had a choice in the matter," Gregg said. And indeed, all the other sources we consulted indicated the administration had to stop the CLASS program because it could not meet its legal requirements. Bachmann is wrong when she suggests the Obama administration voluntarily ended the program in the face of negative public opinion about the overall health law. Which brings us to another point -- the CLASS program is not an integral part of the health care law, as some might think upon hearing Bachmann's comments. Most of the health care law has to do with expanding the coverage of traditional health care insurance. The CLASS program was intended to stand as a totally separate program only designed to help with long-term care. Even if the CLASS program ends, the rest of the health care law still stands. Even Gregg agreed this was the case, telling the Post, "This was not a core element of the overall bill. It was put in as a courtesy to Sen. Kennedy. I do happen to think the overall bill is going to massively fail on the fiscal side and probably fail on the substantive side too. But you can separate off the CLASS Act as not having an effect on the underlying bill, even though the underlying bill will also fail." Finally, Bachmann said the Obama administration is "arguing with itself" about whether the CLASS Act should be formally repealed. Actually, the Obama administration has said that the law should be left on the books, calling a formal repeal unnecessary and unproductive. The law’s advocates say it should be left so it can be modified at some future time. That position has drawn scorn from Republican leadership. "It defies logic for the White House to admit this part of their health spending bill would put an unsustainable burden on taxpayers, yet demand it stay on the books," said Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, in comments to the Associated Press. Our ruling Bachmann said, "Obamacare is so flat-out unpopular, that even the Obama administration chose to reject part of Obamacare last Friday, when they tried to throw out the CLASS Act, which is the long-term care function." She's right that the Obama administration announced the program was ending. But the Obama administration is being forced to scuttle the program because it can't meet the cost requirements the law sets out. It's not because the administration's support is folding in the face of unpopularity. Bachmann messes up so many of the details as to significantly misrepresent the situation.

pomt-13838	Says Ron Johnson "supported a plan to cut benefits and raise the retirement age" for Social Security.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jul/13/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/state-democrats-say-ron-johnson-supported-plan-cut/	Social Security is a perennial campaign issue. And so it is with the 2016 U.S. Senate race in Wisconsin, a rematch between Republican incumbent Ron Johnson and the man he defeated in 2010, Democrat Russ Feingold. The Wisconsin Democratic Party targeted Johnson on the issue with a radio ad released May 4, 2016. A few moments into the spot, the narrator says: "As senator, Johnson’s been working hard to undermine Social Security. He supported a plan to cut benefits and raise the retirement age. Johnson even said it’s a shame that George Bush wasn’t able to privatize Social Security. And he didn’t stop there. Johnson went after Medicare, voting to turn it into a voucher program." We rated Mostly True the Medicare-voucher claim, as Johnson backed plans advanced by fellow Wisconsin Republican Paul Ryan, who is now the House speaker. Under those plans, Medicare would no longer pay fees to health care providers -- instead, Medicare beneficiaries would get a fixed subsidy to use toward their health care. Now let’s see whether Johnson has supported a plan to cut benefits and raise the retirement age for Social Security. Democratic Party’s evidence To back its claim, the Democratic Party cited Johnson’s support for two proposals -- one by Ryan and one by U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah. Both were broad proposals, not specific strictly to Social Security. Ryan’s 2010 "Roadmap" proposal called for what the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel described as "a wholesale rethinking" of Social Security, as well as Medicare and federal taxes. On Social Security, it would have reduced some benefits and raised the retirement age. But based on two statements cited by the Democratic Party, Johnson didn’t express support for the Social Security changes, or for the Roadmap overall, rather he merely praised Ryan. Johnson said he "applauds" Ryan "for putting forth a plan in good faith to begin the conversation on entitlement reform" and he said Ryan showed "courage" by advancing proposals such as the Roadmap. Lee made a proposal in 2012 that included provisions to reduce the size of cost-of-living increases and raise the retirement age for Social Security. Johnson was among 17 senators who voted for it. But it was a federal budget proposal, covering a vast number of programs and proposals, not just Social Security. So, voting for the budget wasn’t necessarily showing support for every element it contained. Johnson has said he is open to considering various options for shoring up Social Security, including cutting benefits and raising the retirement age. And he has pointed out, without necessarily endorsing the idea, that raising the retirement age would save money. But that isn’t the same as supporting a proposal to make those changes. What’s going on here, of course, is an age-old political exercise -- one side resists committing to a specific plan, while the other tries to pin as many unfavorable details on the other as possible. We are left to sort it out based on what is on the record and the facts known now, not on speculation about what a future vote might involve. Our rating The state Democratic Party says Johnson "supported a plan to cut benefits and raise the retirement age" for Social Security. The party could not cite and we couldn’t find any proposal to make those changes that was supported by Johnson. Indeed, such a standalone proposal would have made major news. Johnson has said he is open to considering such proposals and he voted for a federal budget proposal that contained them. But voting for a federal budget proposal and its myriad programs isn’t an explicit show of support for cutting benefits and raising the retirement age for Social Security. For a statement that contains an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1c82fcd0-22a2-4862-91b9-823b934a4ade	None	Democratic Party of Wisconsin	None	None	None	2016-07-13T05:00:00	2016-05-04	['None']
pomt-11414	Says Rebecca Dallet "has talked about her interest in advocating for policies that need to be changed to achieve her political objectives."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/mar/21/michael-screnock/has-rebecca-dallet-candidate-backed-liberals-supre/	In a televised debate from Milwaukee between the two remaining Wisconsin Supreme Court candidates, Sauk County Circuit Judge Michael Screnock, who is backed by conservatives, attacked Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Rebecca Dallet, who is backed by liberals. In the March 2, 2018 debate, a month ahead of the April 3, 2018 election, Screnock charged that Dallet "has talked about her interest in advocating for policies that need to be changed to achieve her political objectives." We found in a previous fact check that Dallet had not been as partisan as Madison attorney Tim Burns, who was eliminated in the primary election. But while Dallet generally sticks to stating her "values" on key issues, there have been instances where she’s gone further. Values vs positions For this fact check, we’re reviewing eight statements made by Dallet. Regarding the first six, Dallet campaign manager Jessica Lovejoy told us Dallet "has not shied away from talking about her common Wisconsin values of equality, fairness, clean air and water, and good schools. She does not advocate for specific policies to advance these values." As we’ll see, in the first three statements, Dallet singled out mass incarceration, the environment and fighting "right-wing special interests" as issues that she said need to be addressed, though she didn’t advocate for specific policies. 1. I’m not going to apologize for standing up for safer communities and for victims. And I think that we can do that while also trying to address racial injustice and the problem of mass incarceration. 2. Just look at our president and you have to worry about equal protection under the law. Women are under attack. We have to protect our environment. 3. I believe we (Burns and her) share many of the same values, and I hope that we can unite Wisconsinites to fight against right-wing special interests and make our state Supreme Court work for the people again. But in the next three statements in which Dallet talked about her values, she went further. Dallet talked about not making it more difficult to vote, alluding to the debate over whether Wisconsin’s photo ID law makes it more difficult to vote; she attacked the National Rifle Association, which is known for its activism to protect gun-owner rights; and she flatly stated that sales of a particular gun should be outlawed. 4. I believe in clean air and water, I believe in our public education system and I believe in working people. I think we need to ensure we increase participation in our voting system, not decrease it. I think we need to address racial and gender inequality head on, not sweep the vestiges of a racist and patriarchal system under the rug. 5. That’s why I took the #NoNRAMoney pledge. I will not accept money from an organization that puts profits above the lives of Americans. Will you join me today in pledging that we won’t vote for any candidate who takes NRA money? nonramoney.org/voter-pledge #NRABoycott 6. Why do you need that rifle that was used in that (Parkland, Fla.) school shooting? What was it, an AR-15? Who ever needs to fire off that many rounds in a minute? There is no reason for that gun. There is no basis for it. It’s not a gun that should be sold in the United States. I mean, let’s talk about reasonable gun control …. I’m not going to write that law, that’s going to be our legislatures. But we should all -- I mean, I’m a citizen just like everyone else -- we should all write our legislatures, tell them how we think and let them write those laws. Recusal rule On the remaining two statements, Lovejoy told us that when Dallet speaks about changing policy, "she's referencing the need to update the Supreme Court recusal policy that currently allows sitting justices," such as retiring Justice Michael Gableman, "to remain on cases where a party spent significantly on their behalf in their election." Here are those Dallet statements: 7. It is the time for women. It’s a time for making sure we stand up and our rights are protected. And experience matters to get the policies we want to move forward and to protect our rights. That statement was made during the concluding remarks of a campaign appearance. Dallet had begun her remarks talking about her experience as a prosecutor and judge, then she talked at length about the importance of the recusal rule, and then she spoke about the experience Screnock and Burns have, before concluding. It could be argued that in making the "policies we want" statement, Dallet was echoing her remarks about recusals rather than making a general statement about the need "get the policies we want." But in the final statement, from a radio interview, it’s harder to see the argument that Dallet was referring to recusals. 8. All of the values that I talked about -- clean air and water, and equal protection, and women -- are under attack. And, this is something we all feel and we all relate to. And I'm the candidate that is going to be able to protect those values at this critical time, and there is just too much at stake right now to have someone without the experience needed to advocate for the policies that need to be changed and to make sure to protect those values. Dallet had been asked earlier in the interview about recusals. But she made the statement we cite when asked about about why she featured criticism of President Donald Trump in her first TV campaign ad. Our rating Screnock says Dallet "has talked about her interest in advocating for policies that need to be changed to achieve her political objectives." Dallet frequently says she is merely stating her values, such as equal rights or clean air and water, and often she singles out those issues without advocating for a particular policy position. But on some occasions she has gone beyond that. For example, after citing clean air and water, and equal protection as her values, she pledged to "advocate for the policies that need to be changed." And she has advocated for addressing "mass" incarceration; increasing voter participation and not allowing the sale of AR-15 guns. We rate Screnock statement’s Mostly True.

pomt-12413	"It was a 100 percent lie that (Donald Trump’s) election unleashed anti-Semitism. … Hundreds of Jewish community centers had bomb threats called in. To the best of our knowledge to this day, 90 percent of them were called in by an American Jewish kid living in Israel, and the other 10 percent were a black radical who was trying to impress his girlfriend."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2017/may/22/dennis-prager/were-two-people-responsible-virtually-all-anti-sem/	A segment hosted by CNN’s Don Lemon on May 18, 2017, got a little heated. Lemon and one of his guests, conservative radio host Dennis Prager, sparred over an apparent increase in anti-Semitic incidents after the 2016 presidential election, and who was to blame. Prager said there was no rise in anti-Semitic incidents, and the incidents that did occur didn’t have anything to do with Donald Trump. "It was a 100 percent lie that his election unleashed anti-Semitism," Prager said. "Hundreds of Jewish community centers had bomb threats called in. To the best of our knowledge to this day, 90 percent of them were called in by an American Jewish kid living in Israel, and the other 10 percent were a black radical who was trying to impress his girlfriend." Is he correct? We found that Prager has a point about the bomb threats to Jewish community centers largely being the work of two suspects who have since been arrested. However, there is evidence that the number of anti-Semitic incidents other than bomb threats did increase after the election. (Prager did not respond to email inquiries.) The suspects To date, the FBI announced two arrests related to the bomb threats. (We should note that the two individuals cited below have not been tried yet.) The first came on March 3, when the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York announced a charge of cyberstalking against a St. Louis man, Juan Thompson. Thompson was charged with "allegedly stalking a former romantic interest by, among other things, making bomb threats in her name to Jewish Community Centers and to the Anti-Defamation League." The Justice Department said that Thompson appeared to have made "at least eight of the JCC threats as part of a sustained campaign to harass and intimidate" his victim. Prager was wrong that Thompson tried to impress a girlfriend; he is charged with trying to implicate an ex-girlfriend in crimes she didn’t commit. As for calling him a "black radical," that’s a somewhat subjective. The Riverfront Times, a St. Louis newspaper, said that as a black journalist, Thompson had filed "searing dispatches about injustices in Baltimore, Mississippi and Chicago. He relished the opportunity to strike back at what he calls an ‘oppressive, anti-black, racial supremacist, capitalist system’ that kneecaps all but the country's rich and white in the pursuit of basic civil rights and opportunities." Then, on April 21, the Justice Department announced that charges had been filed against Michael Ron David Kadar, an 18-year-old resident of Israel with dual citizenship in the United States and Israel. The charges in question were for making telephone bomb threats against Jewish facilities in central Florida and for providing false information to police in Georgia. Then-FBI director James Comey said in a statement that "this kind of behavior is not a prank, and it isn't harmless. It’s a federal crime. It scares innocent people, disrupts entire communities, and expends limited law enforcement resources." So Prager’s on target when he cites Thompson and Kadar as the two individuals charged so far with making Jewish community center bomb threats. The bomb threats Somewhat less certain is the total number of threats called in to Jewish community centers. As we noted, officials have tied Thompson to eight calls. Meanwhile, the criminal complaint against Kadar alleged that between Jan. 4 and March 7, Kadar made "at least 245 telephone calls involving bomb threats and active shooter threats. A significant portion of the threats targeted Jewish community centers and other historically Jewish institutions such as Jewish schools and Anti-Defamation League offices." The FBI declined to comment further to PolitiFact, citing the ongoing investigation. So the exact number of threats the two individuals made -- once duplicate calls and calls made to non-Jewish targets are set aside -- is hard to nail down. However, the number of calls they made appears to be in the ballpark of the number of reported bomb threats. It’s not certain that threats numbered in the "hundreds," as Prager said, but if not, they weren’t far off. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a group that tracks hate crimes, has tracked upwards of 170 such threats made internationally and domestically. And the Anti-Defamation League -- another group that tracks hate crimes, and which was a target of a number of the calls in question -- has identified 167 such threats in the United States in Canada. (The ADL’s tally did not count other countries, as the SPLC did.) Given this data, Prager has a point that most of the bomb threats are traceable to the two individuals who have been charged so far, and he’s also correct that Kadar has been charged with making many more than Thompson. Aryeh Tuchman, associate director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, said that there are probably a modest number of bomb threats not traceable to either of these two suspects. "The two individuals that Prager mentioned accounted for the vast majority of the bomb threats, but not all of them," Tuchman said. That said, Tuchman added one further piece of evidence that Thompson and Kadar account for the vast bulk of threats: "Thankfully, there have been no further bomb threats recently," he said. Anti-Semitic incidents more broadly But if Prager has described the situation with the Jewish community center bomb threats with reasonable accuracy, he has engaged in a bit of cherry-picking by ignoring other signs of increased anti-Semitism after the election. "Even if the bomb threats are discounted, we still saw an increase in anti-Semitic incidents in the first quarter of 2017," Tuchman said. "Not including the bomb threats, there were 380 total incidents in the first quarter of 2017, up from 291 incidents in the first quarter of 2016. That’s an increase of 31 percent." Incidents in 2016 cited by ADL include instances of harassment (such as voice mails or social media attacks), vandalism (such as graffiti) and assault (including one incident in which two shots were fired at a victim’s vehicle). Tuchman added that the number of incidents in December 2016 were almost 70 percent higher than the number of incidents in December 2015. Tuchman cautioned that ADL "believes that the presidential campaign was a factor in the increase in anti-Semitic incidents, but only one factor." But even if the election was only one factor among many, the rise in anti-Semitic incidents overall call into question Prager’s assertion that it’s a "100 percent lie that his election unleashed anti-Semitism." Our ruling Prager said, "It was a 100 percent lie that his election unleashed anti-Semitism. … Hundreds of Jewish community centers had bomb threats called in. To the best of our knowledge to this day, 90 percent of them were called in by an American Jewish kid living in Israel, and the other 10 percent were a black radical who was trying to impress his girlfriend." He’s close to the mark in describing the overwhelming role of two suspects in making bomb threats against Jewish targets earlier this year. However, Prager ignores a documented rise in anti-Semitic incidents beyond bomb threats. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-14073	"Amendment 2 will put almost 2,000 pot shops in Florida ... more pot shops than Walmart and Walgreens combined."	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/may/19/vote-no-2/medical-marijuana-dispensaries-will-outnumber-walm/	Opponents of Florida’s medical marijuana amendment have fired up a new round of attacks, claiming there will be a dispensary on practically every corner if voters approve the initiative. In a three-minute ad released May 16, 2016, the group Vote No On 2 calls Amendment 2 "a scam to legalize pot." Should the measure pass, they say, it’s likely that places to buy medical marijuana will outnumber two well-known retail outlets. "Looks like Amendment 2 will put almost 2,000 pot shops in Florida ... more pot shops than Walmart and Walgreens combined," the video says. It goes on to deride California medical marijuana regulations and users, and implies Florida would become like the Golden State if the measure passes. While polls say medical marijuana is enjoying about 80 percent support among voters, Vote No On 2’s figures spark an interesting point. Would the number of medical marijuana dispensaries outnumber Walmarts and Walgreens locations in Florida? That's possible, according to one state estimate, but the figures are a little hazy. Dispensary data Amendment 2 was first on the ballot in 2014 but narrowly lost the 60 percent required to pass. The current version for the November 2016 ballot has the same name, but United for Care, the group behind the measure, altered the language to address some concerns that hounded the 2014 amendment. The amendment now requires parental consent and doctor certification for minors and more clearly defines the medical conditions it covers: cancer, HIV/AIDS, epilepsy, glaucoma, post-traumatic stress disorder, Crohn’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis "or other debilitating medical conditions of the same kind or class as or comparable to those enumerated," with a doctor’s recommendation. It works like this: If a patient with one of these conditions gets the okay from a doctor, they (or a certified caregiver) will get a state-issued ID card and be able to go to a state-regulated dispensary to buy their marijuana. Doctors technically can’t prescribe marijuana because it is still a Schedule I drug under federal law, meaning it’s considered highly addictive and has no known medical benefits, and is therefore illegal. Doctors would risk losing their ability to practice medicine. Pharmacies also can’t legally distribute cannabis, making dispensaries necessary. So how many dispensaries would there be? The proposed amendment leaves the details of medical marijuana regulations up to the Legislature and the Florida Health Department. Legislators would need to pass a bill for medical marijuana and the health department would develop and enforce regulations. In essence, there could be as few or as many dispensaries as the state wants. There’s only one estimate for how many patients and dispensaries there would be — a 2015 health department analysis. That report used Florida Department of Economic and Demographic Research data to estimate 440,552 patients in Florida would qualify for medical cannabis. The amendment would lead to 1,993 registered treatment centers, the health department said. That’s the figure Vote No On 2 is using in its ad. United for Care doesn’t dispute the figures, because the health department’s analysis is the only study that’s been done. "It’s the best educated guess that we have," United for Care director Ben Pollara said. "It’s up to the Department of Health and the Legislature. … It could be 2,000, it could be 20. It could be 5,000." In any event, 1,993 dispensaries would outnumber all the Walmarts and Walgreens in Florida. Vote No On 2 spokeswoman Christina Johnson said the group chose those businesses to illustrate how ubiquitous dispensaries would be should the amendment pass. The video correctly shows 840 Walgreens drug stores in the state, but includes 191 Walmarts, a figure apparently derived from a January 2007 list from Reclaim Democracy, a group seeking limits on corporate influence in government. A more recent list from Walmart shows 223 supercenters and 10 discount stores. (Neighborhood Markets and Sam’s Club stores are not included in either count.) While Walmart and Walgreens do have pharmacies, we’re not convinced pitting small medical cannabis dispensaries against big chain retailers is a fair comparison. It may be better to compare so-called "pot shops" to the overall number of pharmacies. The state health department told us there are 9,725 licensed pharmacies in Florida. To provide more context for the dispensary estimate, we will note that the state Department of Business and Professional Regulation says Florida has 2,082 active licensed veterinary clinics — and 1,893 package liquor stores. Mile-high estimate With so little spelled out in the proposed amendment, we wondered how the health department arrived at its estimate of 1,993 dispensaries. The health department told us they used Colorado, with about 5.3 million people, for the analysis because the state has allowed medical cannabis for years and has a broad baseline of data. The report says there are 515 licensed medical marijuana centers as of October 2015 (there are 528 now, according to the Colorado Department of Revenue) serving almost 114,000 patients. Analysts then scaled that up to Florida’s population of 20 million. Karen O’Keefe, director of state policies and the pro-legislation Marijuana Policy Project, said of the 24 states and the District of Columbia allowing medical marijuana, it’s misleading to use either Colorado or California as examples for Florida. Not only did Colorado decriminalize recreational marijuana use in 2012 — its 421 retail shops are counted separately from medical dispensaries — but both states lacked the kind of initial regulatory oversight Amendment 2 would require. "California dispensaries still have no state licensing or regulation to speak of, though a regulatory and licensing law should be phased in by 2018," O’Keefe said in an email. "In Colorado, regulations went into effect in 2010-11, but hundreds of dispensaries pre-dated them." A better state to look to would be New Mexico, O’Keefe said, because it required a licensing program in its law when it passed. New Mexico had 23 dispensaries for its 2 million residents, and expanded that to 35 in 2015. Extrapolating Florida’s total based on New Mexico’s regulations would net far fewer dispensaries, O’Keefe said. If it were based on total land area, Florida could limit the number to about 16. If there were the same number of dispensaries per capita as New Mexico, there could be about 340. "I really can’t say how many are likely, since it will depend on many factors, with the primary one being regulations. But I would bet it’s far less than 2,000," O’Keefe said. Our ruling Vote No On 2 said, "Amendment 2 will put almost 2,000 pot shops in Florida ... more pot shops than Walmart and Walgreens combined." The state health department did project 1,993 medical marijuana dispensaries would be needed to serve potential patients, based on data from Colorado compared with Florida. That is more than the 840 Walgreens and 233 Walmart supercenters and discount stores in the state, although the comparison seems like a bit of a red herring. It’s important to remember that while the health department report is the only real estimate available, this figure isn’t definite. The agency and the Legislature would decide the actual number of stores and how they are regulated after the amendment passes. That total is anyone’s guess. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c09fc714-3c09-4d27-a39b-20a3c06cec7b	None	Vote No On 2	None	None	None	2016-05-19T17:04:55	2016-05-16	['Walmart', 'Walgreens', 'Florida']
pomt-01335	"Obama, instead of nominating a health professional, he nominated someone who is an anti-gun activist (for surgeon general)."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/23/ted-cruz/cruz-obamas-surgeon-general-pick-not-health-profes/	The lack of a surgeon general -- the federal government’s top public health spokesperson -- has become a point of contention as the public panics about Ebola. Sen. Ted Cruz said President Barack Obama is to blame for the fact that the position hasn’t been filled. "Look, of course we should have a surgeon general in place," Cruz, R-Texas, said on CNN’s State of the Union Oct. 19. "And we don’t have one because President Obama, instead of nominating a health professional, he nominated someone who is an anti-gun activist." Obama nominated Dr. Vivek Murthy in November 2013, but Senate Republicans blocked his confirmation the following spring because of alleged anti-gun leanings. The National Rifle Association, which scores policymakers’ records on gun rights, announced that it would ding senators who voted for Murthy. CNN’s Candy Crowley pushed back on Cruz’s assertion, noting that Murthy is a doctor. Cruz acknowledged that, but repeated his original point: "He is a doctor, but where he’s made his name is as a crusader against Second Amendment rights." It’s up for debate how much of an impact the surgeon general would have in the current Ebola situation. But it’s bogus for Cruz to imply that Murthy -- a graduate of Yale School of Medicine -- is not primarily a health professional. It’s also a bit of a stretch to call Murthy an "anti-gun activist." A career in public health Here are some of Murthy’s credentials as a health professional: Received his doctor of medicine degree in 2003 from the Yale School of Medicine; Is a physician and Harvard Medical School instructor at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, one of the best hospitals in the country; Has contributed to vaccine development and cancer research published in several medical journals, including the Journal of the American Medical Association, Science, and the Journal of the National Cancer Institute; Co-founded TrialNetworks, which provides medical researchers with information technology systems for managing clinical trials; Member of the U.S. Presidential Advisory Council on Prevention, Health Promotion and Integrative and Public Health. Also of note: As a student, Murthy co-founded two India-based public health projects, one while as an undergraduate at Harvard University and the other while at Yale. The first focused on AIDS prevention, and the latter trained women in rural areas to address community health issues. Political leanings Where Murthy starts to get in hot water with Republicans is with Doctors for America, which he founded and currently heads. Doctors for America is a pro-Affordable Care Act health care reform advocacy group. They started out in 2008 as Doctors for Obama, an arm of the Obama presidential campaign. Doctors for America’s primary cause is health care reform and expanding access to medical services. However, the group also considers gun violence a public health problem, and they have pushed gun control legislation. At a 2013 conference, they held a reducing gun violence workshop. Of particular concern for the NRA is a letter Doctors for America sent to Congress Jan. 14, 2013, following the Sandy Hook school shooting. Murthy’s signature is on the letter. The letter lays out several policy suggestions, including a ban on assault weapon sales, instituting universal background checks and removing laws that prohibit doctors from asking patients if they own a gun -- similar to other Doctors for America proposals. These policy proposals are relatively mainstream and expected from someone who is a political ally to the president. They are also similar to policies supported by other medical associations, such as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics. But the NRA has painted the Doctors for America policy proposals as radical. The NRA and Senate Republicans also made hay with Murthy’s Twitter. In 2012 and 2013, he tweeted occasionally about gun violence -- expressing plainly that he believes in more gun control and that he considers it a health care issue. But does this mean he’d be an advocate for gun control as surgeon general? When we asked Cruz's office for comment, spokesperson Catherine Frazier told us this: "It is wrong to cherry-pick one line out of context from the argument that Sen. Cruz was making, which is that the president’s nominee is no mere health professional, he is a liberal activist that has indicated he would use his position to further a gun control agenda. Both Republicans and Democrats have voiced concern over the nomination." In Murthy’s opening statement at his surgeon general confirmation hearing, though, he listed other public health issues as priorities -- including obesity (his stated primary cause), vaccine-preventable diseases and tobacco use. He did not mention gun control. Later in the hearing, Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., read aloud one of Murthy’s tweets. In response, Murthy said he would not use the surgeon general role as a "bully pulpit for gun control." He added: "The role is not to be a legislator or a judge. The role is to be a public health educator and to bring the country together around our most pressing health care challenges, and I believe at this point that obesity is the defining public health challenge of our time. That is where I intend to put my primary focus." Our ruling Cruz said, "President Obama, instead of nominating a health professional, he nominated someone who is an anti-gun activist." Murthy has a long list of credentials showing he is a health professional, including his position as an attending physician at a leading hospital. Murthy runs a health care reform organization that has pushed for gun control measures, and he has expressed personal support for gun control. But enacting gun control is not Murthy’s main cause and not part of his public surgeon general platform. It’s no secret that Murthy is a political ally for Obama and backs his positions on gun control. But it's inaccurate to say he's an anti-gun activist but not a health care professional. We rate Cruz’s claim False. Update, Oct. 24, 2014: After we published this item, Frazier, Cruz’s spokeswoman, wrote us to say that we didn’t note in our original report that Cruz acknowledged Murthy was a medical doctor. We have added to the story additional context from the interview with Crowley to make that clear. Still, we continue to believe that Cruz was inaccurate to minimize Murthy’s substantial record as a medical professional -- in ways unrelated to gun policy -- and caricature him as primarily an advocate. Our rating remains the same.	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2014-10-23T18:28:59	2014-10-19	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-01642	Says of Mitch McConnell, "What can happen in 30 years? A senator can become a multi-millionaire in public office."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/25/alison-lundergan-grimes/alison-lundergan-grimes-ad-says-mitch-mcconnell-ma/	Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democratic challenger to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, thinks her opponent has been in office way too long. Grimes released a new ad last week that blasted McConnell for his 30-year tenure in Washington. McConnell -- the expected Senate majority leader if he defeats Grimes and the GOP wins enough seats in November -- is running for his sixth term. The ad says that one of the side effects of staying in office too long is that a senator can become a multi-millionaire and lose sight of the needs of average constituents. "What can happen in 30 years?" the ad’s narration says. "A senator can become a multi-millionaire in public office, while voting 17 times against the minimum wage, three times for corporate tax breaks that send Kentucky jobs overseas, and 12 times against extending unemployment benefits for laid off workers." That’s a lot to chew on, but we’ll limit our assessment here to the question of whether senators can really make millions in office. Our friends over at the Washington Post Fact Checker looked into a similar claim by Grimes in May and found that it fell flat. Because the charge is being aired anew, we decided to take a look. Senate salaries It’s true that McConnell was not a millionaire when he became a senator in 1985 but has become a multimillionaire since then. As of 2012, his estimated worth was $22.8 million, making him the 10th-richest senator, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which collects data on money in politics. That’s almost twice as much net worth than the typical senator in 2012; the average was $12.1 million. The problem with the ad is its strong suggestion that McConnell made his millions from being a senator. That’s not the case. When we asked the Grimes campaign for evidence, they pointed to Senate salaries going back to 1985. Senators’ salaries have grown from $75,100 in 1985 to $174,000 in 2009, and they haven’t changed since. McConnell has been the Senate minority leader since 2007, meaning his salary is higher -- about $193,400, according to the Congressional Research Service. (For comparison, Grimes’ current annual salary as Kentucky’s secretary of state is $117,329, according to the Kentucky state government’s salary database.) So adding up annual salaries between 1985 and 2014 and adjusting for McConnell’s leadership positions, McConnell would have earned more than $4 million before taxes and deductions. But as of 2012, McConnell is worth nearly $23 million. If his wealth didn’t come from his office, how did McConnell get so rich? McConnell’s wealth The truth is, much of McConnell’s money comes from his second wife, Elaine Chao, whom he married in 1993. (McConnell was married to his first wife, feminist scholar Sherrill Redmon, from 1968 until 1980.) Congressional financial disclosure forms cover both spouses if the lawmaker is married. Chao, who served as labor secretary under President George W. Bush, is the daughter of James S. C. Chao, the founder of a major international trade company. After immigrating to the United States from China in the 1960s, Mr. Chao founded Foremost Maritime Corporation -- now the Foremost Group, of which he is the chairman. We couldn’t figure out exactly how much James Chao is worth. But the Chao Family Foundations recently donated $40 million to build a new executive education center at Harvard Business School. So how did McConnell’s finances change when he married Elaine Chao? The good news is that elected officials are required to fill out public financial disclosure forms annually. The bad news is that the Senate Public Disclosure Office at the Capitol tosses out any forms that are more than six years old. However, we were able to access McConnell’s disclosure forms back to 1995 through the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money in politics. And McConnell’s campaign gave us the forms for 1994, 1993 and 1992. All congressional financial disclosure forms show assets, income and liabilities in broad value ranges. For example, if someone owns a piece of property worth $800,000, it will be categorized on the form as being valued between $500,000 and $1 million. For consistency, let’s assume the maximum amount possible based on those broad ranges. In 1992 -- in the middle of his second term and the year before he married Chao -- McConnell had up to $825,000 in assets and about $46,000 in income (such as speaking fees and investment returns) on top of his Senate salary. He also had up to $300,000 in liabilities, such as property mortgages, bringing down his net worth. After marrying Chao in 1993, McConnell reported a maximum of $2.6 million in assets -- including a piece of real estate worth up to $1 million that belonged to Chao -- and $93,500 on top of his Senate income. He also had $815,000 in liabilities. And that same year, McConnell inherited his mother’s estate. Fast-forwarding to 2012, his net worth -- $22.8 million -- was nearly three times higher than it was five years earlier (in 2007, it was $7.8 million). In 2008, as we found in McConnell's discloure forms from that year, he and his wife received a gift of between $5 million and $25 million after Chao’s mother died. This apparently accounts for the bulk of the increase during that five-year period. Our ruling Grimes’ ad said, "What can happen in 30 years? A senator can become a multi-millionaire in public office." What's problematic here is the ad’s strong suggestion that McConnell somehow managed to leverage his public office into personal riches. In truth, most of the growth in his wealth stems from his marriage and money his wife received after her mother died. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate this claim Mostly False. Correction, Aug. 25, 2014: An earlier version of this article included the figure for Grimes’ salary that was reported on her Senate candidate financial disclosure form. However, this figure -- $188,000 -- included earnings from 2013, as well as from part of 2014. To make the comparison equivalent to McConnell’s salary, we’ve adjusted her annual pay to $117,329.)

pomt-14069	Before 2005, "the percentage of" Texas high school "students meeting the college readiness standards of the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board stood at 28% in English and 42% in math. Those figures stood at 65% and 66% in 2013."	true	/texas/statements/2016/may/20/don-willett/justice-don-willett-accurately-recaps-surge-texas-/	Deep in the May 2016 Texas Supreme Court ruling that upheld and critiqued the current school funding system is encouraging news about the performance of Texas students. On Page 58 of the majority opinion, Justice Don Willett (who subsequently showed up among individuals that presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said he’d consider to succeed Antonin Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court) refers to a November 2005 decision by the court that required lawmakers to change the system. At the time of the West Orange-Cove II ruling, Willett writes, "the percentage of students meeting the college-readiness standards of the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board stood at 28% in English and 42% in math. Those figures stood at 65% and 66% in 2013," Willett continues. Did Texas high school graduates get so much more college-primed that fast? Best we could tell, the cited figures track with state test results tracked by the Texas Education Agency. Then again, as few as 26 percent of Texas high-school graduates lately show a readiness for college according to a couple of other respected metrics. Texas Success Initiative With help from Texas Education Agency officials, we found figures very close to what Willett presents in the 2016 majority opinion. According to the agency, in 2004, 29 percent of students fulfilled college readiness standards for English language arts and 43 percent did so for math while in 2013, 65 percent of students met readiness standards for English, 66 percent for math. With rare exception, according to the agency, the percentage of students fulfilling each readiness standard escalated steadily through the intervening years. And most recently, in 2014, 68 percent of students met the English readiness standards with 67 percent doing so in math, the agency says. We wondered what the percentages meant. They reflect student test results, TEA spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson advised, in keeping with a state law that requires college and universities to assess incoming high school graduates for their readiness to take college courses and offer remedial instruction as needed. Under the program, called the Texas Success Initiative, the TEA has reported on the readiness of high-school students by calculating the share of students who meet related expectations on the state-mandated English language arts and math 11th grade/exit-level Texas Assessment of Knowledge & Skills. Asked if perhaps standards loosened between 2004 and 2013, Culbertson pointed out by email that in each of the years, a student classified as ready for college needed "scale scores of 2200" on each relevant TAKS including a 3 (out of a possible 4) on the writing portion of the English test. To our inquiry, Shannon Housson, TEA director of performance reporting, said by phone the 124 percent and 54 percent respective improvements in students meeting the readiness standards over nine years reflected schools and students adjusting to and, in some cases, mastering the English and math TAKS, which were given from 2003 through 2011 before yielding to the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness. At its inception, Housson said, the TAKS added up to a "significant increase in rigor" for students accustomed to the previous state-mandated exams. "I remember the angst in the schools," Housson said, as teachers and others came to terms with the new focus on "higher-order thinking skills" linked to the state-set curriculum rather than simply academic skills. Finally, Willett’s citation of the 2005 court decision on school finance led us to look back at how that opinion by Justice Nathan Hecht presented the percentages of students meeting the readiness standards. In the ruling, Hecht showed results for all students plus break-outs suggesting considerable performance lags among African American, Hispanic and Limited English Proficient students. Results for 2013 suggest such gaps have closed quite a bit except among students the state deems English Language Learners. Texas Students With Test Scores Suggesting College Readiness, 2004 and 2013 Subject All Students African-American Hispanic White LEP/ELL* English (2004) 29% 19% 20% 36% 3% Math (2004) 43% 21% 29% 56% 13% English (2013) 65% 55% 60% 74% 14% Math (2013) 61% 51% 55% 71% 12% SOURCES: Web pages, entries for Texas Success Initiative - Higher Education Readiness Component, statewide reports for 2004, 2013 Academic Excellence Indicator System, Texas Education Agency, both undated (accessed May 16, 2016) *Limited English Proficient/English Language Learners SAT, ACT scores There are other ways to gauge college readiness. In 2014, nearly 34 percent of the state’s students who took the pre-college SAT (or 32 percent of public school students taking the test) did well enough to demonstrate a readiness for college work without remediation, according to the College Board, which associates an SAT score of 1550 out of 2400 with a 65 percent probability of obtaining a first-year college GPA of B- or higher. The same year, among 60 percent of 116,147 Texas high school graduates to take the ACT scored well enough to show a readiness for college English, the Iowa-based group says, with 47 percent doing so in math and 36 percent demonstrating readiness in science--and only 26 percent clearing all the tests’ college-readiness benchmarks. ACT says its readiness benchmarks are "scores on the ACT subject-area tests that represent the level of achievement required for students to have a 50% chance of obtaining a B or higher or about a 75% chance of obtaining a C or higher in corresponding credit-bearing first-year college courses." Our ruling Willett, writing for the court majority, said that before 2005, "the percentage of" Texas high-school students meeting the coordinating board’s college readiness standards "stood at 28% in English and 42% in math. Those figures stood at 65% and 66% in 2013." This statement doesn’t acknowledge readiness metrics such as ACT or SAT scores. But it almost perfectly reflects the state’s tallies of high school graduates in 2004 and 2013 who scored high enough on state English and math tests to be considered college-ready.

pomt-01832	"At some point in their lives, 99% of women use birth control."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jul/18/susan-happ/susan-happ-says-some-point-their-lives-99-percent-/	The U.S. Supreme Court’s controversial "Hobby Lobby" decision in June 2014 involved contraception and the insurance coverage that companies are required to provide to employees under the Affordable Care Act. In a 5-4 decision, the court agreed with arguments made by Hobby Lobby, a chain of arts and crafts stores. Attorneys for the owners had argued they should not be forced to provide certain kinds of contraception that they feel violate their religious freedom. The decision was criticized by Democrats, who argued it allows some companies to make a health care decision for their female employees -- including which forms of birth control are covered. For instance, under the decision, the pill is okay, but intrauterine devices and the morning-after pill can be turned down. Jefferson County District Attorney Susan Happ, a Democrat running in the Aug. 12, 2014 primary for attorney general, laid out her concerns about the ruling in broad terms. "Giving corporations, executives and bosses the ability to make decisions about women’s health care is deeply regrettable," she said in a June 30, 2014 news release. "At some point in their lives, 99 percent of women use birth control. This decision seems to ignore that fact and side with corporations over women." Others have cited a similar figure, including President Barack Obama on Feb. 10, 2012 when he unveiled a compromise on birth control coverage in his health care bill that aimed to address concerns raised by the Catholic Church. "Nearly 99 percent of all women have relied on contraception at some point in their lives –- 99 percent," Obama said at a White House briefing. Is Happ right that virtually all women rely on birth control at some point in their lives? When asked for backup, Happ’s campaign directed us to a Feb. 14, 2013 report, "Contraceptive methods women have ever used: United States, 1982-2010," published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That report was based on interviews with 12,279 women between 2006 and 2010. Each woman was asked a series of questions about whether she or a partner had ever used each of more than 20 methods of contraception. The goal of the report was to prepare national estimates on the use of contraception in the United States. Its conclusions were pretty straightforward: "Virtually all women of reproductive age in 2006–2010 who had ever had sexual intercourse have used at least one contraceptive method at some point in their lifetime (99 percent, or 53 million women aged 15–44)." The report said 88 percent of the women in that group have used "a highly effective, reversible method such as birth control pills, an injectable method, a contraceptive patch, or an intrauterine device." It added that the most common methods used were the male condom (93 percent), the pill (82 percent), withdrawal (60 percent), and the injectable Depo-Provera (23 percent). The report also said that the use of contraception had increased from 94.8 percent of sexually experienced women in 1982, to 98.2 percent in 1995 and 99.1 percent in 2006-2010. So the report is pretty clear when it comes to widespread use of contraception among sexually active women considered to be of reproductive age. But Happ’s claim was broader than that. She did not limit it to an age group, or qualify it as sexually active women, which the report did. That means there are some problems with her claim. For instance, the report says that only 86.6 percent of the women surveyed ever had sex with a male, meaning 13.4 percent never did. Similar trends were found in previous CDC surveys. A 2005 report said that about 8.4 percent of the women included in a 2002 survey said they had never had sex with a man. That survey was of 7,643 women between the ages of 15 and 44. When Obama made his 2012 statement, Cybercast News Service noted that the 2010 CDC report found 13.9 percent of women surveyed never had sexual intercourse, a figure that’s in line with the more recent study cited by Happ. So how many women are we talking about? According to the 2012 Census , the United States had about 92 million women between the ages of 15 and 44, so the number of women who never had sex is just over 12 million women. It is also worth noting that the CDC report says says 93 percent of women reported using condoms, and 60 percent reported using withdrawal as a birth control method. Those figures help drive the conclusion that virtually all women use birth control at some point in their lives. Neither, of course, is provided by prescription -- the context in which Happ made her claim. So, that also serves to skew the numbers behind the point she is making. Our rating Happ said "at some point in their lives, 99% of women use birth control." It’s clear she was arguing that contraception use is widespread, and important for women who run the risk of getting pregnant. But in making the statement, Happ used an overly broad brush, applying what is true for a subset (sexually active women between 15 and 44) and applying it to a larger group (all women). We rate her claim Half True.	None	Susan Happ	None	None	None	2014-07-18T05:00:00	2014-06-30	['None']

And then there's former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who Beck said "opened the tent and gave you government health care that is now bankrupting the state." "That was my problem with the Massachusetts Romneycare," Beck said, referring to a three-year-old mandate that requires everyone in the state to have health care. "I remember saying to him, 'Mitt, you're not king. You're not going to be there forever. You opened the door, the progressives came in.'" In many ways, the Massachusetts health care model mirrors a plan lawmakers are considering on Capitol Hill, so we wondered whether the mandate could be the budget-buster Beck claims it to be. First, a few words about the Massachusetts plan. When Romney became governor in 2003, he was looking for a way for Massachusetts to make health care cheaper and more accessible. "People who don't have insurance nonetheless receive health care. And it's expensive," he told National Public Radio in 2006. "We're spending a billion dollars giving health care to people who don't have insurance. ... And my question was: Could we take that billion dollars and help the poor purchase insurance? Let them pay what they can afford. We'll subsidize what they can't." Thus began Romney's plan for an individual mandate, a requirement that nearly everyone have health insurance, even those who are unemployed. Though Romney vetoed eight parts of the bill, including a provision that would have fined small businesses that failed to comply with the mandate (the legislature overrode that veto), the basics of his original vision remained intact throughout the legislative process. Commonwealth Care is a program that helps low-income consumers pay for plans while Commonwealth Choice acts as an insurance exchange for individuals and small businesses. The program is subsidized by taxpayer dollars and federal funding. Today, about 96 percent of the state's population has health insurance, either through the state program, their employers or by other means, which ranks Massachusetts first in the nation in terms of percentage of people with some form of coverage. Nevertheless, Commonwealth Care has had its share of criticism. Some critics say it's been a boon to the insurance industry, while others complain that some consumers are paying even more for coverage, not less, as state lawmakers initially hoped. (In fact, Massachusetts has some of the most expensive health care per family in the country, according to some studies.) Another complaint: Commonwealth Care has taken a significant bite out of Massachusetts's bottom line. Indeed, the program has been quite popular. Initially, the state projected that 215,000 people would eventually be enrolled in the program at the cost of $725 million. By 2007, enrollment had reached 80,000 and six months later, the number had doubled to 158,000 people. In 2008, enrollment peaked at more than 177,000 people. Currently, the state is expecting to spend about $880 million on Commonwealth Care in the coming budget year; that's about 3.3 percent of the state's $27 billion budget. So, while the program has become more expensive, it has not been the budget-buster that Beck suggests. We asked experts whether the state would still be facing a $5 billion deficit if the program hadn't been put into place, and the resounding answer was "yes." "Beck joins a long and growing list of uninformed commentators who allege that Massachusetts’ health reform is bankrupting the state," said Michael J. Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, a tax policy think tank. "He and they are absolutely wrong." The state's budget deficit has been caused by an unprecedented collapse in state tax revenues, Widmer said. According to the administration, tax revenues have fallen $2 billion below the amounts the fiscal 2009 budget was built upon. And the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center, a left-leaning budget think tank, says the problem has been compounded by permanent tax cuts put in place during the late 1990s. Adding to these financial woes is an increase in the number of people relying on unemployment benefits as the result of losing their jobs, said Alan Sager, a professor of health policy and management at Boston University. "The state would be facing a deficit no matter what," Sager said. So, while the state may be broke, it has little to do with the health care program Mitt Romney put in place over three years ago. Instead, tax revenue shortfalls and a growing reliance on unemployment benefits due to layoffs have put a massive budget burden on the state. As a result, we give Beck a False.

pomt-14201	"Andrew Jackson was the last president who actually balanced the federal budget, where we had no national debt."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/21/ben-carson/andrew-jackson-debt-balanced-budget-president/	Former Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said it doesn’t make sense that President Andrew Jackson will no longer be the centerpiece of the $20 bill because he was the last master of the federal budget. Carson, who now backs Donald Trump, lamented the 19th century president’s displacement in an April 20 interview on Fox Business. "Well I think Andrew Jackson was a tremendous secretary — I mean a tremendous president," Carson said. "I mean, Andrew Jackson was the last president who actually balanced the federal budget, where we had no national debt." Black abolitionist Harriet Tubman, who rescued slave families using the underground railroad, will replace Jackson on the front of the $20 bill, while a smaller image of Jackson’s face will appear on the back. Jackson’s appearance on the bill has stirred up controversy as of late, especially because Jackson, a populist and a war hero, presided over the removal of approximately 46,000 Native Americans from their land. We wondered if Carson had his historical facts straight. We took Carson’s statement to mean that Jackson was the last president to do both things: balance the budget and eliminate debt. A lot of presidents have presided over balanced budgets, which is when the government takes in more revenue than it spends, leading to no net borrowing in that year. But a balanced budget doesn’t necessarily mean no debt, because old debt can carry over from previous years. Jackson was, in fact, the only president to preside over a total elimination of all remaining debt while having a balanced budget. However, this wasn’t nearly as dramatic of an accomplishment as it would be today. Experts told us to take this factoid with a grain of salt because the debt was already on its way down, and by the time Jackson took office, the amount of debt was trivial. The history Jackson, who served from 1829-37, was an ardent supporter of keeping banks and government separated. He believed that banks would have undue influence on government, and he was hell-bent on eliminating the debt. (Jackson was also deeply skeptical of paper currency, which adds some irony to the current debate over his position on the $20 bill.) In January 1829, the debt was about $58 million. (Jackson took office that March.) In today’s dollars, that amounts to about $1.4 billion. The total public debt outstanding today is higher by many orders of magnitude: $19.2 trillion. Jackson watched that debt scale down to zero in 1835. According to the Treasury Department, the debt remained close to zero when Jackson left office. But Jackson didn’t have to take much action to make this happen. Since the end of the War of 1812, which racked up a lot of debt, Congress required debt reductions of at least $10 million per year under under Jackson’s two predecessors, James Monroe and John Quincy Adams. So all Jackson really had to do was maintain the status quo, said Daniel Feller, a Jackson expert at the University of Tennessee. "The policy of paying off the debt happened before Jackson, and he happened to be president" when the debt hit zero, Feller said. In addition to continuing the already-established debt-reduction policy, Jackson vetoed some infrastructure bills that would have spent money on things like building roads. He also liquidated the Second Bank of the United States, a precursor to the Federal Reserve, resulting in a massive surplus of government money that was used to pay off the last of the debt, said Neil Buchanan, an expert in federal spending patterns at George Washington University Law School. Immediately following Jackson’s departure, the country experienced a financial crisis, the Panic of 1837. The panic resulted from several factors, including the collapse of a speculative land bubble and international capital flows, but some economists believe Jackson’s fiscal policies should carry some of the blame. "The country did eventually have the good sense to borrow again, to finance the country's enormous economic expansion throughout the 19th and 20th centuries," Buchanan said, noting that it is not always desirable to bring debt down to zero. While the only president to see a national debt of zero, Jackson certainly wasn’t the only president who presided over a balanced budget. In today’s world, it’s rare for the federal government to balance its budget, meaning revenue is higher than expenditures. Since the 1960s, only five years have had balanced federal budgets: 1969 under President Richard Nixon; 1998, 1999 and 2000 under Bill Clinton; and 2001 under George W. Bush. But in earlier years, balanced budgets were much more regular. From 1900 to 1960, about 25 years had balanced budgets, according to government historical tables. Before that, we don’t have year-to-year budget breakdowns. But we do know that there was an overall budget surplus from 1800 through 1850, so balanced budgets were a fairly regular occurrence around the time Jackson was in office. Fuller backed up that point. "Carson is merely applauding Jackson for having paid off the debt through a one-time gimmick," as opposed to adjusting policy to keep the debt low for the long run, Buchanan said. Our ruling Carson said, "Andrew Jackson was the last president who actually balanced the federal budget, where we had no national debt." Experts say this feat doesn’t really deserve the plaudits Carson is giving it, but Carson has his facts basically right. Jackson was the last — and only — president to bring the national debt to zero on top of having a balanced budget. The statement is accurate but needs added context, which is our definition of Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/72b86490-26c7-4af9-81a5-736827d02e19	None	Ben Carson	None	None	None	2016-04-21T17:06:40	2016-04-20	['None']
pomt-12598	Says Tammy Baldwin "supported legislation allowing citizens to withhold funding for our troops."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/apr/05/restoration-pac/early-attack-ad-says-tammy-baldwin-backed-letting-/	More than a year and a half before she faces re-election for a second term, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin was hit with a super PAC ad that attacks her on military funding and dealing with the threat of terrorism from Iran. The video from Restoration PAC, posted March 21, 2017, makes a series of attacks. We’ll check its first one, which comes after a photograph of the Wisconsin Democrat appears on the screen. "Tammy Baldwin has some interesting ideas on how to keep us safe," the female narrator intones. "She supported legislation allowing citizens to withhold funding for our troops." Congress, of course, provides funding for the military -- not citizens directly. And couldn’t Congress easily move money collected through taxes from one fund to another? Let’s explore why this attack mostly misses its target. The PAC We rated as Pants on Fire a Restoration PAC ad that supported Wisconsin’s other U.S. senator, Republican Ron Johnson, in his 2016 win for a second term. The ad used a fake image to make it appear that President Barack Obama had met with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani. As a super PAC, the suburban Chicago-based Restoration PAC can raise unlimited amounts of money from corporations, unions, associations and individuals. And it can spend unlimited money to advocate for or against political candidates. According to the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics, the group took in $4 million during the 2016 election cycle, with $3.8 million of it contributed by Richard Uihlein, president and CEO of Uline Inc., a packaging supply company based in Pleasant Prairie, Wis., near Chicago. Nine days after the Restoration PAC video posted, it was announced that Uihlein had given $2 million to another super PAC that is encouraging Republican businessman Kevin Nicholson to run against Baldwin in 2018. The attack When the attack on Baldwin is made in the Restoration PAC ad, a footnote appears referring to the 2009 version of the Religious Freedom Peace Tax Fund Act, which has been introduced perennially but has never become law. The measures would allow citizens to redirect their tax dollars away from the military -- but not actually withhold funds from troops. According to a summary of the 2009 bill by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service: The bill would have applied to conscientious objectors -- people opposed to any participation in war, usually based upon moral, religious or other beliefs, who made their status known to the U.S. Treasury Department. The department would have had to put income, gift and estate taxes paid by those people in a fund "to be allocated to any appropriation not for a military purpose." Baldwin, then a member of the House of Representatives, was a co-sponsor of the 2009 version, as she had been in 2003, 2005 and 2007. (She was not a cosponsor in 2011, nor in 2013 or 2015, after being elected to the Senate.) To back the attack on Baldwin, a Restoration PAC spokesman referred us to a 2012 article by Media Trackers, a conservative website. The article claimed that Baldwin’s support of the 2009 bill meant she wanted to "block funding for body armor and medical supplies for U.S. troops." But as Milwaukee Journal Sentinel watchdog columnist Daniel Bice reported at the time, when Baldwin faced attacks over the bill in her first Senate campaign, experts say the measure was a feel-good bill that wouldn't lead to federal defense cuts. What the bill could do As the experts told Bice, if the taxes from conscientious observers could not be used on military items, lawmakers could simply dip into another pot of tax dollars to underwrite war-related expenses. Even the group pushing the legislation said at the time the bill would not "directly decrease the amount of money spent on war." And its website now says the bill would "not immediately impact the level of military spending." Roberton Williams, a fellow at the nonprofit Tax Policy Center, told us the bill’s effect would be "symbolic at best." Added Steve Ellis, vice president of the nonprofit Taxpayers for Common Sense: "It’s a pretty empty piece of legislation; more like an accounting trick. Clearly this is intended for a conscientious objector to feel better about their taxes, but it doesn’t reduce their tax bill or really withhold funding for our troops.’" Our rating Restoration PAC says Baldwin "supported legislation allowing citizens to withhold funding for our troops." Baldwin on four occasions, most recently in 2009, cosponsored a bill that would have allowed conscientious objectors to direct the federal government not to use their income taxes and other tax payments for any military purpose. But the bill would not have restricted Congress’ ability to allocate money to the military; even the organization pushing the legislation acknowledges it would not reduce military funding; and experts agree it is a symbolic measure that would not result in funding being withheld from troops. For a statement that contains an element of truth but leaves out important details, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-06608	President Obama "went around the world and apologized for America."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/22/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-repeats-claim-obama-went-around-world-/	In a debate in Orlando on Sept. 22, 2011, Mitt Romney charged that President Obama has gone around the world apologizing for America. President Obama "went around the world and apologized for America," Romney said, in response to a question about Israel and the Middle East. Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, has made this charge several times. The first time we checked it was when he made the charge is his own book, No Apology: The Case for American Greatness. Here’s the claim from Romney’s book that we checked back then: "Never before in American history has its president gone before so many foreign audiences to apologize for so many American misdeeds, both real and imagined," Romney wrote. "It is his way of signaling to foreign countries and foreign leaders that their dislike for America is something he understands and that is, at least in part, understandable. There are anti-American fires burning all across the globe; President Obama's words are like kindling to them." In the book, Romney specifically named the speeches he was referring to: "In his first nine months in office, President Obama has issued apologies and criticisms of America in speeches in France, England, Turkey, and Cairo; at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, the National Archives in Washington, D.C., and the United Nations in New York City. He has apologized for what he deems to be American arrogance, dismissiveness and derision; for dictating solutions, for acting unilaterally, and for acting without regard for others; for treating other countries as mere proxies, for unjustly interfering in the internal affairs of other nations and for feeding anti-Muslim sentiments; for committing torture, for dragging our feet on global warming and for selectively promoting democracy." At the time, we rated the claim False. Romney made a similar claim in June 2011 during a campaign appearance when he said, "A few months into office, (President Barack Obama) traveled around the globe to apologize for America." We rated that one Pants on Fire, because he implied the trips were intended to offer the president a forum to apologize to other countries. That was hardly the case. Let’s recap our specific findings. What Obama said For starters, as we looked over Obama's remarks, we noticed that he never used the word that is the universal hallmark of apologies: "sorry." Merriam-Webster defines an apology as "an admission of error or discourtesy accompanied by an expression of regret." We read the seven Obama speeches cited in Romney’s book and selected the passages that seemed the most critical, apologetic or conciliatory, and then ran them by several experts with different points of view. Because of their length, we've compiled those passages into a separate document with links to the full remarks, and we encourage you to click over and read those remarks now. At times, Obama uses an on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand formulation that he tends to employ right before he asks the two sides to come together. At a town hall meeting in France, for example, Obama encouraged Europe to work with the United States, and admitted that the United States "has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive." But he immediately said that Europe has been guilty of a "casual" and "insidious" anti-Americanism. "On both sides of the Atlantic, these attitudes have become all too common. They are not wise. They do not represent the truth. They threaten to widen the divide across the Atlantic and leave us both more isolated," Obama concluded. And at a major address to the United Nations, Obama said, "I took office at a time when many around the world had come to view America with skepticism and distrust. Part of this was due to misperceptions and misinformation about my country. Part of this was due to opposition to specific policies and a belief that on certain critical issues, America has acted unilaterally, without regard for the interests of others. And this has fed an almost reflexive anti-Americanism, which too often has served as an excuse for collective inaction." At other times, Obama doesn't seem so much to be criticizing the United States as he is criticizing the foreign policy stances of the Bush administration. In England, a reporter said that during the 2008 campaign, Obama had said that the power and authority of the United States had diminished in recent years. Obama was quick to turn the question toward the Bush team. "Well, first of all, during the campaign I did not say that some of that loss of authority was inevitable," Obama said. "I said it was traced to very specific decisions that the previous administration had made that I believed had lowered our standing in the world.... I would like to think that with my election and the early decisions that we've made, that you're starting to see some restoration of America's standing in the world." At a speech in Cairo on relations between the United States and the Islamic world, Obama got very close to regretting decades-old U.S. actions in Iran. But then he immediately countered with criticism of Iran. He did not make a formal expression of regret, but suggested both countries simply "move forward." Here are his exact remarks: "In the middle of the Cold War, the United States played a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government. Since the Islamic Revolution, Iran has played a role in acts of hostage-taking and violence against U.S. troops and civilians. This history is well known. Rather than remain trapped in the past, I've made it clear to Iran's leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward." Looking at all the remarks Romney cited, we noticed that Obama is most conciliatory when discussing torture and detention at the U.S. military installation at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Obama mentioned this in four separate instances that Romney cited in his book. Typically, Obama would say that the United States must always stay true to its ideals, and that's why Obama "unequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the United States, and I have ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed by early next year." (He has not been successful with his order of closing Guantanamo; we’ve rated it a Promise Broken.) Obama's most pointed remarks on Guantanamo were at the National Archives, in a major speech on fighting terrorism. Obama said that after 9/11, "our government made a series of hasty decisions. I believe that many of these decisions were motivated by a sincere desire to protect the American people. But I also believe that all too often our government made decisions based on fear rather than foresight; that all too often our government trimmed facts and evidence to fit ideological predispositions." He also said that the Guantanamo prison "likely created more terrorists around the world than it ever detained. So the record is clear: Rather than keeping us safer, the prison at Guantanamo has weakened American national security. It is a rallying cry for our enemies." Did Obama apologize? Back in 2010, we sent Obama's remarks to several different experts on foreign policy and apologies, to see if they thought Obama was apologizing. • Nile Gardiner, a foreign policy analyst with the the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Obama is definitely apologizing, and it's not good. He co-wrote the Heritage analysis, "Barack Obama's Top 10 Apologies: How the President Has Humiliated a Superpower." "Apologizing for your own country projects an image of weakness before both allies and enemies," Gardiner said. "It sends a very clear signal that the U.S. is to blame for some major developments on the world stage. This can be used to the advantage of those who wish to undermine American global leadership." He noted that Obama tends to be most apologetic about how the United States has fought terrorism and its approach to the Iraq war. "There is a very strong partisan element to his apologies, but the biggest driving factor is Obama's personal belief that the U.S. is not an exceptional, uniquely great nation," he said. • John Murphy, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, studies presidential rhetoric and political language. He said Obama is using conciliatory language for diplomatic purposes, not apologizing. "It's much more a sense of establishing of reciprocity," Murphy said. "Each side says, okay, we haven't done great, but we have a new president and we're going to make a fresh start and move forward. I don't think that's an apology. ... In rhetorical history, an apology is generally considered an account of some kind of bad behavior in which you are going to take responsibility and express regret." Romney's criticisms of Obama are part of a conservative tradition that emphasizes steadfastness in foreign policy, particularly in the wake of the Vietnam War. "There's long been a strain of conservative rhetoric that argues that what matters most for the United States in the world is our will," Murphy said. "The difficulty with that was shown in the second Bush administration, when will power is not quite enough. In Iraq, for example, you have to have a battle plan that makes sense and understand the situation you're going into'' and have enough resources to do that. • Lauren Bloom, an attorney and business consultant, wrote the book, The Art of the Apology, advising businesses and individuals on when to apologize and how to do it. She said Obama's words fall short of an apology, mostly because he didn't use the words "sorry" or "regret." "I think to make an effective apology, the words 'I'm sorry' or 'we're sorry' always have to be there," Bloom said. Obama's remarks are really non-apologies, and they're not good in business or personal relationships, Bloom said. The one area where they can be useful: international diplomacy. "Gov. Romney is trying to appeal to the inner John Wayne of his readers, and that has a certain emotional appeal," Bloom said. "For the rest of us, a level assessment of less-than-perfect human behavior is perfectly reasonable." • Rhoda E. Howard-Hassmann, a professor who studies international human rights, maintains the Web site Political Apologies and Reparations, a database of documents on apologies. Many of the apologies in the database relate to genocide or slavery. "To say the United States will not torture is not an apology, it is a statement of intent," Howard-Hassman said. "A complete apology has to acknowledge something was wrong, accept responsibility, express sorrow or regret and promise not to repeat it." Obama's Cairo address in particular was a means of reaching out to the Islamic world, not an acknowledgement of wrongdoing, she said. "Whether he's apologizing or not, he's saying 'I respect your society, and I respect your customs.' Maybe that's what Romney considers an apology, that gesture of respect," she said. "But a gesture of respect is not an apology." Other presidential apologies Short of conducting a full review of all American presidents to see if any others had ever apologized, we decided to narrow our focus and look at Obama's two immediate predecessors, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Several sources we reviewed discussed Clinton's remarks about the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, and described them as an apology. But Clinton did not explicitly apologize, and he assigned responsibility to the international community, not just the United States. "The international community, together with nations in Africa, must bear its share of responsibility for this tragedy as well," Clinton said in Rwanda in 1998. "We did not act quickly enough after the killing began. We should not have allowed the refugee camps to become safe haven for the killers. We did not immediately call these crimes by their rightful name: genocide. We cannot change the past. But we can and must do everything in our power to help you build a future without fear, and full of hope." Clinton did apologize, forcefully, to the survivors and families of the experiments conducted in Tuskegee, Ala., in which government doctors left sick men untreated as part of a research study on syphilis. "The United States government did something that was wrong -- deeply, profoundly, morally wrong," Clinton said at a formal ceremony in 1997. "To the survivors, to the wives and family members, the children and the grandchildren, I say what you know: No power on Earth can give you back the lives lost, the pain suffered, the years of internal torment and anguish. What was done cannot be undone. But we can end the silence. We can stop turning our heads away. We can look at you in the eye and finally say on behalf of the American people, what the United States government did was shameful, and I am sorry." Bush made remarks in 2002 about American slavery, which some people construed as an apology, at Goree Island, Senegal. But Bush did not formally apologize or express regret, instead opting to praise the Americans in history who worked to end slavery. "My nation's journey toward justice has not been easy, and it is not over," he said. "The racial bigotry fed by slavery did not end with slavery or with segregation. And many of the issues that still trouble America have roots in the bitter experience of other times. But however long the journey, our destination is set: liberty and justice for all." Bush did, however, specifically apologize to King Abdullah of Jordan for the abuse of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. The 2004 apology took place privately, but Bush and Abdullah spoke soon after at a Rose Garden press conference. "We also talked about what has been on the TV screens recently, not only in our own country, but overseas -- the images of cruelty and humiliation. I told His Majesty as plainly as I could that the wrongdoers will be brought to justice, and that the actions of those folks in Iraq do not represent the values of the United States of America," Bush said. "I told him I was sorry for the humiliation suffered by the Iraqi prisoners, and the humiliation suffered by their families. I told him I was equally sorry that people who have been seeing those pictures didn't understand the true nature and heart of America." Obama's praise and motivations While Obama has admitted mistakes, he has also praised America. Romney acknowledged as much when he wrote that Obama, "always the skillful politician, will throw in compliments about America here and there." In Cairo, Obama called the United States "one of the greatest sources of progress that the world has ever known. ... We were founded upon the ideal that all are created equal, and we have shed blood and struggled for centuries to give meaning to those words -- within our borders, and around the world." At the Langley speech, Obama told the CIA staff, "What makes the United States special, and what makes you special, is precisely the fact that we are willing to uphold our values and our ideals even when it's hard, not just when it's easy; even when we are afraid and under threat, not just when it's expedient to do so. That's what makes us different. So, yes, you've got a harder job. And so do I. And that's okay, because that's why we can take such extraordinary pride in being Americans. And over the long term, that is why I believe we will defeat our enemies, because we're on the better side of history." And at his speech accepting the Nobel Prize, Obama said: "Whatever mistakes we have made, the plain fact is this: The United States of America has helped underwrite global security for more than six decades with the blood of our citizens and the strength of our arms. The service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform has promoted peace and prosperity from Germany to Korea, and enabled democracy to take hold in places like the Balkans. We have borne this burden not because we seek to impose our will. We have done so out of enlightened self-interest -- because we seek a better future for our children and grandchildren, and we believe that their lives will be better if others' children and grandchildren can live in freedom and prosperity." What’s new from the debate What Romney said at the debate in Orlando -- "He went around the world and apologized for America" -- is very similar to what he said at his campaign stop in June -- "A few months into office, he traveled around the globe to apologize for America." At the debate, Romney added this comment: "He addressed the United Nations in his inaugural address and chastised our friend, Israel, for building settlements and said nothing about Hamas launching thousands of rockets into Israel." We looked again at Obama's first speech at the United Nations. It's true that he does not specifically mention Hamas. But it's certainly not a one-sided chastisement of Israel. Obama repeatedly calls on Palestinians to understand and respect Israel's security needs. And he specifically mentions the fear Israeli civilians have of rocket attacks. "We must remember that the greatest price of this conflict is not paid by us. It's not paid by politicians," Obama said. "It's paid by the Israeli girl in Sderot who closes her eyes in fear that a rocket will take her life in the middle of the night. It's paid for by the Palestinian boy in Gaza who has no clean water and no country to call his own." Our ruling Some of the Obama speeches that Romney cited in his book certainly laid out Obama’s foreign policy ideas, and it seems fair to say that a less confrontational approach was among Obama’s goals. Obama had made no secret during the campaign that he intended to set a different course on foreign policy than Bush -- a committed unilateralist -- had pursued. Still, we think it’s incorrect for Romney to portray these early speeches as part of a global apology tour. Using Romney’s standard, you could argue that any change in foreign policy that’s undertaken after a presidential transition and announced to the world would constitute an "apology" for the previous policy. On the substance of Romney’s charge, we believe that what we wrote in March 2010 still stands. While Obama's speeches contained some criticisms of past U.S. actions, those passages were typically leavened by praise for the United States and its ideals, and he frequently mentioned how other countries have erred as well. We found not a single, full-throated apology in the bunch.

pomt-02307	Says Rick Scott presided over cuts to the Bright Futures college scholarship program.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/apr/01/american-bridge-21st-century/rick-scott-presided-over-bright-futures-cut-democr/	Republican Gov. Rick Scott paid for college by working at a doughnut shop and getting help from the GI bill. Now he says he wants low-income students to have that same shot at the American dream that he did. Scott has called for lowering the cost of college, including challenging colleges to offer $10,000 degrees. On March 17, 2014, he repeated that message at a college affordability roundtable at Barbara Goleman High School in Miami Lakes. Democrats were watching. American Bridge 21st Century, a Democratic super PAC, used a video clip of a reporter interviewing Scott at the event to produce an online attack video. While a smiling Scott appears to be standing in a library, a reporter asks: "In your first year in office you proposed millions of dollars in cuts to public education. Then in 2011-12 over those two years (you) signed off on tuition increases of 13 percent. You presided over cuts to the Bright Futures college scholarship program. To what extent is your recent efforts to boost education and hold the line on costs of education re-election politics?" "All of that is incorrect," Scott responded, and then the video cuts him off. Text on the screen says, "Scott approved cuts to Bright Future scholarships," followed by, "Rick Scott is bad for Florida." We heard the rest of Scott’s defense thanks to a recording by Miami Herald education reporter David Smiley. Scott talked up funding increases for K-12 education, "record funding for universities" and his fight to cut higher education tuition -- but he didn’t mention Bright Futures. Education funding has been a hot topic in the race between Scott and former Gov. Charlie Crist, the Democratic frontrunner. Here we will examine American Bridge’s charge that Scott presided over cuts to Bright Futures. Bright Futures Launched in 1997, Bright Futures is the college scholarship program funded by the Lottery and designed to keep high-achieving students at Florida schools. The Web ad cites a May 2011 article in The Ledger about Bright Futures cuts approved by the Legislature and Scott during the annual legislative session. American Bridge sent us many other articles that described cuts that year. Why would state legislators want to make the program less generous? They say it’s grown too expensive and that too many students qualify. In an effort to make the scholarships more competitive, they have increased test score requirements, a move that drew the attention of the U.S. Justice Department for making it harder for poorer students of minority backgrounds to get the grant. There are a few ways we can examine cuts to the program, by looking at the total number of students served, the total amount of money disbursed, and the average scholarship amount per student. (There are different levels of Bright Futures awards depending on grades and other factors, but we will cite the overall average.) Here are recent years’ numbers on Bright Futures. The spending picture is not settled for the current and future fiscal years, so we have included an estimate for 2013-14 and the proposed figures for 2014-15. Year Number of students served Amount of money disbursed Average award per student 2007-08 159,170 $379.8 million $2,387 2008-09 169,366 $429 million $2,533 2009-10 177,612 $423.5 million $2,385 2010-11 179,076 $423.3 million $2,364 2011-12 174,047 $333.8 million $1,918 2012-13 162,980 $312.1 million $1,915 2013-14 estimated 154,160 $309.4 million $2,007 2014-15 proposed 127,573 $266.2 million $2,086 Source: Florida Department of Education At a glance, it appears the total amount of Bright Futures funding nose-dived after Scott took office. Crist vows on his campaign website to reverse the cuts under Scott. Reality is slightly more muddled. The decline in the total number of Bright Futures recipients and the program's total budget is a result of decisions by the Legislature under both Crist and Scott to rein in costs. (We asked the Crist campaign for a response; they didn’t provide one.) The program’s costs spiraled up from an initial price tag of $70 million in 1997 to $437 million in 2011. Some critics said the standards for getting the awards were too easy. In 2010, Crist’s last year as governor, the Legislature reduced Bright Futures scholarships by $1 dollar for every credit hour. The bill also raised SAT/ACT requirements incrementally, which was expected to lead to a drop in the number of students who would qualify. For example, the Legislature raised the minimum SAT requirement for Florida Medallion Scholars -- one subset of Bright Futures -- from 970 in 2010-11 to 1050 in 2013-14. In 2011, Scott’s first year as governor, the Legislature decided to further raise test scores for 2013-14 graduates. For example, those Medallion Scholars would now have to score 1170 on their SAT by 2013-14. Scott’s summary of his proposed 2014-15 budget states his proposal "fully funds" the scholarships for eligible students and that the decline in total funds is due to a projected decrease of students because they changed the standards. So both Crist and Scott signed legislation that had the effect of reducing funding for Bright Futures. Our ruling American Bridge’s video said that Scott presided over cuts to the Bright Futures college scholarship program. During his tenure, the program’s total budget and number of students served has dropped. The average award amount under Scott is smaller than during the Crist years. However, it's worth noting that the Legislature under both Crist and Scott tightened eligibility requirements, which reduced the number of students who received the money. Both Crist and Scott signed off on those changes. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	American Bridge 21st Century	None	None	None	2014-04-01T15:44:02	2014-03-18	['None']
pomt-13794	Says Hillary Clinton "said all work-related emails were sent back to the State Department. The FBI director said, that's not true."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/19/chris-christie/stamp-one-correct-chris-christie-says-clinton-wron/	Several speakers touched on Hillary Clinton's email scandal at the second night of the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was one. He used it to argue that "Hillary Clinton cared more about protecting her own secrets than she cared about protecting America’s secrets. And then, she lied about it over and over and over again." "She said there was no marked classified information on her server. The FBI director said, that's untrue," Christie said. "She said that she did not email any classified information. The FBI director, says that's untrue. She said all-work related emails were sent back to the State Department. The FBI director said, that's not true." For this fact-check, we'll look at Christie's claim about what happened with Clinton’s work-related emails. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, decided to use a private, unsecured email server at her New York home for government business. When news of the system came to light — indirectly, as part of the investigation into the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya — Clinton's lawyers went through the 60,000 or so emails she had collected to cull out personal communication. She claimed the remaining government-related emails were turned over to the State Department. The Clinton campaign fact sheet on the controversy says she provided copies of 30,490 emails covering over 55,000 pages. "In providing these emails to the department," the fact sheet says, "Clinton included all she had that were even potentially work-related — including emails about using a fax machine or asking for iced tea during a meeting — erring on the side of over-inclusion, as confirmed by the department and National Archives’ determination that over 1,250 emails were 'personal' records (which they have indicated will be returned to her)." That's in line with her statement on the April 3, 2016, edition of Meet the Press where she said, "I think that anybody who's actually looked at this has concluded that I have now put out all of my emails." (At the time, before the FBI released the results of its investigation, we gave her a Half True because more than 31,000 had been deleted by her lawyers without any government review.) And in a Sept. 4, 2015, interview on MSNBC with Andrea Mitchell, Clinton claimed that her lawyers "went through every single email." Then the FBI released the results of its probe. Director James Comey reported finding "several thousand work-related emails that were not in the group of 30,000 that were returned by Secretary Clinton to State in 2014." Some were uncovered because they had been archived in government email accounts belonging to workers who had sent or received them. Some were discovered among the millions of fragments of emails stored in the unused space of the servers used by the Clinton system. Two emails were classified as "confidential;" one was classified as "secret." None were top secret. But Comey also said it wasn't surprising that those work-related emails weren't turned over. "We found no evidence that any of the additional work-related e-mails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them," he said during his news conference. "Our assessment is that, like many email users, Secretary Clinton periodically deleted emails or emails were purged from the system when devices were changed." The FBI director also said some of the work-related emails not turned over to the State Department may have been deleted because her lawyers had not, in fact, gone through every one. Instead, they "relied on header information and used search terms to try to find all work-related emails," he said. "It is highly likely their search terms missed some work-related emails, and that we later found them, for example, in the mailboxes of other officials or in the (unused) slack space of a server." If Clinton had been using a government account like she should have, the work-related correspondence would have been archived, the FBI director said. But her system didn't do that. When we asked the Clinton campaign about Christie's work-related email claim, spokesman Josh Schwerin noted Comey testified before Congress that three of the classified emails were not properly marked as classified, and there was no evidence that any work-related emails were intentionally deleted. Our ruling Christie told the convention that Clinton "said all work-related emails were sent back to the State Department. The FBI director said, that's not true." The FBI did indeed discover that work-related emails had been deleted by Clinton's lawyers despite her insistence, still posted on her website, that she included all emails "that were even potentially work-related." We rate Christie's statements as True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b6405c2c-d0e7-419e-9603-27d1a5dfd1f8	None	Chris Christie	None	None	None	2016-07-19T23:42:48	2016-07-19	['Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation', 'United_States_Department_of_State']
pomt-00238	Says Socrates said, "When the debate is lost, slander becomes the tool of the losers."	pants on fire!	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/oct/08/viral-image/no-socrates-didnt-call-slander-tool-losers/	A viral image on Facebook quotes Socrates as saying, "When the debate is lost, slander becomes the tool of the losers."​ There’s no evidence Socrates said that. The Facebook page Allen West Republic shared the photo on the morning of Sept. 25, the day Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and one of the women accusing him of sexual assault, Christine Blasey Ford, testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. (Kavanaugh narrowly passed the Senate’s confirmation vote and was sworn in Oct. 6.) The post has been shared more than 12,200 times since then, but the misattribution has been around a lot longer. A user posted the quote on Goodreads in 2008, and the quote has been circulating ever since. Socrates didn’t write anything himself, so the picture of who he was and what he said is reliant on others’ writings. Plato and Xenophon wrote about Socrates and slander but not in the context of lost debates, said Christopher Moore, a philosophy and classics assistant professor at Penn State. Socrates believed those who slandered him hated philosophy and truth, but he didn’t call them losers. In Plato’s "Apology," Socrates points to his effort to find men smarter than himself as the root of slander against him, according to Debra Nails, a Michigan State University philosophy professor emeritus. When Socrates decided other men weren’t as smart as him, those men didn’t like him very much. However, there's no evidence of him saying any version of the viral image quote. Plato’s and Aristotle’s versions of Socrates were not interested in debates as something that could be won or lost, at least not by an individual, according to Christopher Rowe, Durham University classics and ancient history professor emeritus. In Socrates’ view, only truth could defeat anyone.

pomt-02979	The goal of Common Core is "to instill federally determined attitudes and mindsets in students including political and religious beliefs."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2013/oct/21/florida-stop-common-core-coalition/common-core-instills-religious-political-views/	If reading about how Common Core aims to establish the same standards across states in reading and math makes you yawn, consider some of the more controversial subjects in which the feds want to tell your children what to think, say Common Core opponents. "The Common Core standards, along with the aligned curriculum and the mining of nearly 400 data points reveal that the goal of the standards is not simply to improve academic achievement but also to instill federally determined attitudes and mindsets in students including political and religious beliefs," states a report on the website of the Florida Stop Common Core Coalition. Here, we will fact-check whether Common Core includes the federal government dictating what students should think about politics and religion. Report that makes claims about Common Core Common Core refers to a set of national education standards adopted by 45 states. The standards were created after years of discussion by private nonprofit groups and state education departments. The goal: to better prepare students for college and careers and ensure that students in all states learn the same academic concepts. President Barack Obama's administration has used its education funding grant process, Race to the Top, to encourage states to use the new standards, but no state is required to adhere to Common Core. Florida is one of the states that approved Common Core. Amid backlash, the state Board of Education voted on Oct. 15 not to adopt reading or writing samples associated with the new national benchmarks -- though local school districts can still choose to do so. Common Core is about standards: the knowledge and skills students are required to have in each grade, from kindergarten through high school, not the curriculum schools use to teach those standards. Florida’s Next Generation Sunshine State Standards include general information about the U.S. political system. It also includes the world's major religions in the World History section. All curriculum decisions are made locally by schools boards, schools and teachers, according to the state Department of Education. We read nothing in the standards that suggested that any level of government was telling students what political or religious beliefs they should personally hold. So what evidence do the critics have for saying the Common Core will instill political and religious beliefs? The Florida Stop Common Core Coalition cited a report written by Education Liberty Watch. The co-authors were Dr. Karen Effrem, President of Education Liberty Watch in Minnesota and a co-founder of the Florida Stop Common Core Coalition, and Randy Osborne, a political consultant who has worked on the campaigns of several conservative candidates and causes, including the Florida marriage amendment. The report zeroes in on something called the National Education Data Model, which lists hundreds of data elements. The report linked to a screen grab it created of those data elements. The list shown includes "voting status" and "religious consideration" and "religious affiliation." (It also includes far more mundane elements such as a student’s birthdate, address and race.) These are elements that districts could choose to collect on any individual in the district: students, parents or teachers. We could not find the same list of attributes on the NEDM website, but we shared it with officials involved with NEDM and they didn’t dispute it. But there are some major caveats about this list of data elements. First, this is not a required list of data for all states or school districts to collect. Instead, it is a voluntary model that states can use to organize student data that they already collect, said Jack Buckley, the commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics. That means states or districts could choose to use some of the data elements and not others, or ignore the data model entirely. Helping states or districts organize their data is something that the feds have done for many years, long before Common Core, he said. Buckley said that federal officials did not come up with these potential elements out of thin air -- they were chosen because certain school districts or states had sought that particular data element in the past. "Remember this is all voluntary," Buckley said. "If your state already collects this, or has a reason why it collects it, (then we tell them) ‘here is how we recommend you code it’ so everyone doesn’t invent their own code for religions.’" We interviewed Alexander Jackl, chief architect Choice Solutions, Inc., an education data software company and one of the original authors of the National Education Data Model. Jackl is also a member of a working group about the newer version -- the Common Education Data Standards, or CEDS. The data fields for religion in particular are useful for private, religious schools, he said. Those fields "are in the NEDM conceptual model as possible attributes," Jackl told PolitiFact in an email. "This makes sense as parochial schools and religious universities might make use of NEDM as well and those elements would be useful for them. It looks, though, like they were not carried forward into CEDS." We contacted a few school districts in Florida to ask if they collect data on voting status, political affiliation or religious affiliations, or if they plan to start doing that with Common Core. Here’s the response we received from a spokesman for Miami-Dade schools: "No. No. No. And no." Broward, Hillsborough and Pasco schools also don’t collect that data. "I can’t think of any useful or legitimate educational reason to know that information," said Linda Cobbe, Pasco schools spokeswoman. The Florida Department of Education does not require school districts to ask about voting status, political affiliation or religious affiliation and has no plan to do so under Common Core, department spokeswoman Cheryl Etters said. Fears have become widespread Claims that Common Core will lead to collecting data about students religious or political beliefs have been repeated by conservative pundits. In Georgia, Gov. Nathan Deal signed an executive order in May to prohibit the state from collecting certain information about students and their families, including religious and political affiliation and voting history. A similar bill was recently introduced in the Michigan house. In response to questions from parents, the Arizona state superintendent of public instruction distributed a fact-sheet that states: "Will the system track a family's political affiliations or firearms ownership? Absolutely not." Also, there is a clear difference between a state or a school district choosing to ask students about their voting status or religious affiliation and, as the report suggests, and using Common Core as a way to "instill federally determined attitudes and mindsets in students including political and religious beliefs." Effrem sent us an email arguing that the Common Core standards are intended "to teach and instill non-cognitive/psychological/socioemotional attitudes." She cited an example of a lesson in Utah in which "students use their voices to advocate solutions to social problems that they care deeply about" and a middle school in Florida that apparently took a Junior Scholastic quiz called "what kind of party animal are you?" But nothing we saw in Effrem’s email proved that as a result of Common Core the federal government is trying to instill particular religious or political beliefs in students. Additionally, we found nothing in either of the data models to suggest that the federal government is telling students what political or religious beliefs they should hold. For public schools, it wouldn’t be constitutional, anyway. Our ruling The goal of Common Core "is not simply to improve academic achievement but also to instill federally determined attitudes and mindsets in students including political and religious beliefs," said an anti-Common Core group. Their evidence, though, is flimsy at best: A computer model that has a data field for voting status or religion, which would typically be used by a private school. We could find no public schools that kept such data, and Florida Department of Education has no plans to require that they do. That’s a far cry from attempting to instill particular religious or political beliefs. We rate this Pants on Fire!

pomt-01220	Austin mayoral candidate Steve Adler opposed an injunction to stop a "company from dumping petrochemicals directly into the Barton Springs aquifer."	half-true	/texas/statements/2014/nov/21/brad-rockwell/steve-adler-represented-store-trying-build-over-aq/	UPDATE, 5:30 p.m., Nov. 25, 2014: After hearing from Rockwell, we removed parts of our original story: testimony about whether mechanical systems could cause the project to meet anti-pollution standards – an element that didn’t speak to Rockwell’s claim – and a comment by a lawyer that workers took care of spilled gasoline, an action we didn’t confirm. We also took out our reference to a wave of litigation. While several judges considered the Lowe’s conflict in 2004, environmentalist groups filed only one lawsuit, Rockwell told us. We also made it clear Rockwell does not believe his statement was an exaggeration. These changes did not affect our rating of the claim. Vivid image: Austin mayoral candidate Steve Adler going to court to keep a judge from stopping petrochemicals from being dumped beneath Barton Springs. Austin attorney Brad Rockwell recently charged Adler, an eminent-domain lawyer, with doing just that. (Disclosure: Rockwell's daughter, Lilly Rockwell, covers city government for our parent newspaper, the Austin American-Statesman. She wasn't involved in this fact check.) "I met Steve Adler in litigation while he was representing a company who was dismantling the SOS ordinance," Rockwell said at a Nov. 12, 2014, press conference held with mayoral candidate Mike Martinez next to the lengthy spring-fed swimming pool. Adler and Martinez vie in a Dec. 16 runoff. At the press conference, Brad Rockwell was referring to the Save Our Springs law approved in 1992 to limit development potentially polluting the pool. Rockwell, former deputy director of the Save Our Springs Alliance, continued: "Adler opposed our efforts to get an injunction to stop this company from dumping petrochemicals directly into the Barton Springs aquifer." Did Adler battle for a company to dump oil ‘neath the pool? Adler represented Lowe’s It’s public record that Adler represented Lowe’s before an Austin state district judge in 2004 and opposed a temporary injunction, shortly granted, that kept Lowe’s from continuing to build a store in Southwest Travis County. In March 2005, though, the Austin City Council moved to settle the dispute, clearing the way for the Brodie Lane store. Adler and others went before a judge in July 2004 in response to a lawsuit brought by the city of Sunset Valley and environmental groups that year intended to stop the Lowe’s project from being built on land in the heart of the Barton Springs recharge zone, described in Statesman news stories at the time as covering a 20-mile stretch of Travis and Hays counties. Rainfall in the zone percolates through soil and creek beds, a November 2003 Statesman news story said, replenishing the segment of the Edwards Aquifer that supplies not only Barton Springs but wells serving 50,000 residents. In question: Whether the plaintiffs were right that the construction was subject to the Save Our Springs ordinance limiting impervious cover to 15 percent or, as Lowe’s maintained, the company was free to put in up to 40 percent impervious cover in keeping with what Travis County permitted. In the July 1, 2004, hearing before Judge Scott Jenkins, Adler advanced reasons the project wasn’t subject to the SOS ordinance. Among his contentions: The land wasn’t in Austin’s purview, or extraterritorial jurisdiction, or if it was, the project still could proceed under looser development rules in place when plans were initially submitted to Sunset Valley. Engineer’s testimony And according to a hearing transcript, Adler didn’t say a word about whether Lowe’s should be allowed to pour petrochemicals into the earth. But during the hearing, parties seeking the injunction, including the city of Sunset Valley and Save Our Springs, called to the stand Lauren Ross, an environmental engineer, who testified about her visits to the construction site the day before. Asked if she observed conditions that would drive up average annual pollutants on the site after completion, Ross testified: "There are clearly pollutants present on the site and discharging from the site that would not have been present prior to the beginning of the construction process." Specifically, Ross said, she saw "clear evidence of hydrocarbon sheens on the water in the construction rock" around a fuel tank in violation of state requirements. Also, Ross testified, there’s "no containment to prevent fuel spills from moving across the site." She said that when she visited in the morning, a mesh silt fence intended to keep sediment from flowing off the site was breached at a spot where it looked to her like the land was graded to make all runoff head that way; she said the fence was restored by the time she returned in the afternoon. Most disturbing, Ross said, she saw that water running off the site wasn’t going into a culvert along Brodie Lane. Instead, she said, the flow was going into a hole in the ground onto limestone rock beneath, meaning all the project’s runoff was "being discharged directly onto limestone that is presumably a recharge feature" for the aquifer, she said. Asked what the flowing water looked like, Ross said the water had been filtered through the silt fence, but still had sediment and "any of those escaping hydrocarbon sheens that we know are on the site at a more distant location." Ross, asked her opinion of the environmental effect of the construction and on surrounding water features of the Lowe’s project, said: "There is significant risk. And I think what I saw yesterday indicates it is much more than just a risk of contamination of downstream waters and the Edwards Aquifer from the proposed construction. It is clear that despite the engineering standards for erosion-type construction irrigation controls, these systems fail." She also said she couldn’t recall seeing before the level of hydrocarbon sheens on a construction site that she saw on the Lowe’s site. Earlier in the hearing, Adler told the judge that stopping the $19 million project, which he called "well underway," was "going to cause greater environmental damage and greater harm than allowing the project to continue." His legal contentions extended to mention of a 2003 state law intended to make the site subject only to Travis County’s development rules. Judge mentions ‘hydrocarbon spills’ Jenkins’ temporary injunction, issued July 2, 2004, said that if the construction continued, the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable injury due to degradation of waters in nearby Williamson Creek, Barton Springs, the Edwards Aquifer and Sunset Valley water wells. The court further finds, Jenkins wrote, "an increased risk of water pollution, were construction allowed to continue in violation of the SOS Ordinance, because of the failure risks inherent in man-made pollution-control features." Also, Jenkins directed Lowe’s to "ensure storm water runoff from the property be diverted from flowing into aquifer recharge features at or adjoining the property, that Lowe’s remove fuel tanks from the property, that Lowe’s remove from the property water contaminated by hydrocarbons and perform reasonable remediation of any hydrocarbon spills at the property." In an interview, Rockwell stressed the judge’s order as an indication his statement was accurate as well as comments by Ross to the Austin Bulldog for a May 21, 2014, news story quoting her saying that what she saw the day before the hearing was "totally my worst nightmare about why we need to minimize construction over the aquifer. The fuel storage tank failed, secondary containment around the tank failed. ... The silt fence was down, and there was direct migration into the Edwards Aquifer," Ross said. Adler calls claim 'outrageous' Adler called the dumping characterization outrageous. "To dump petrochemicals directly into the Barton Springs aquifer would be illegal in addition to being immoral," Adler said in an interview. "Neither I nor Lowe’s nor co-counsel ever argued that the company should be able to dump petrochemicals into the aquifer." The vital issue in court, Adler said, was whether a 4-3 vote by the Austin City Council in December 2003 was sufficient to let the development proceed. Save Our Springs and others successfully maintained in courts through 2004 that in keeping with the SOS ordinance, six council votes should have been required for the project to launch. Adler told us: "Lowe’s doesn’t want to be dumping hydrocarbons down. No one in the courtroom would countenance dumping hydrocarbons down the aquifer." Adler noted, too, that concerns about hydrocarbons going into the ground from the site weren’t part of pre-hearing briefs. Rockwell agreed, albeit pointing out no one knew of the oily sheen until the inspection visit by Ross. Rockwell, asked if his statement was an exaggeration, replied not. He also said that what he said at the press conference didn’t "purport to summarize the whole litigation or everything about what the injunction fight was about. It’s one aspect, one very important aspect." Other lawyers in the dispute To our inquiries, other lawyers in the dispute offered conflicting takes on this claim. Doug Young, the city attorney for Sunset Valley, which sided with the environmental groups in court, said by phone: "Was Steve trying to vindicate the right of his client, Lowe’s, to dump petrochemicals down a recharge hole into the aquifer? No, I don’t think he was. But did he hear the uncontroverted testimony of Dr. Ross that there were petrochemicals in the surface water there?" Young added: "It would be unreasonable to assume Lowe’s intended to dump that gas on the ground and either not worry about where it went or intend for it to go down this recharge feature. There’s no reason to believe that. But it happened. And they opposed" the injunction to stop the construction. Daniel Byrne, who like Adler represented Lowe’s in the hearing, said by phone: "The notion that anyone was pumping petrochemicals into the aquifer is complete garbage." We emailed North Carolina-based Lowe’s about this topic and didn’t hear back. Our ruling Rockwell said Adler opposed an injunction to stop a "company from dumping petrochemicals directly into the Barton Springs aquifer." It’s not that simple. Adler, representing Lowe’s in court, opposed a successful push by the City of Sunset Valley and environmental groups to get a temporary injunction to stop Lowe’s from continuing to build a store over the aquifer. In a hearing, an expert for the plaintiffs testified about observing a hydrocarbon sheen being part of runoff flowing from the site onto underground limestone and, significantly, the judge’s order in response said Lowe’s should address any oil spills. So, Adler sought to keep a project going that on the day before the hearing appeared to one engineer to be sending runoff with an oily sheen directly underground. However, there is vital missing context in that the legal fight wasn’t rooted in letting Lowe’s dump -- or stopping Lowe’s from dumping -- petrochemicals. The big issue was whether the site should be built out with up to 40 percent impervious cover or the 15 percent allowed under the SOS ordinance. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.

Trump did, however, tweet that he had asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to look into a situation with farmers in South Africa. "I have asked Secretary of State @SecPompeo to closely study the South Africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers," Trump tweeted on Aug. 22. Trump seemed to be quoting a report by Fox News’ Tucker Carlson. He’s talking about a legal battle over land rights unfolding in South Africa. There are very few actual statistics that show racially based farm violence. The last time our colleagues Africa Check fact-checked farm murders in 2017, they found 57. It isn’t true that Trump is sending troops to South Africa. He never said that. We rate this statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-13373	Says Colorado Democratic congressional candidate Morgan Carroll "racked up $11 billion in new spending" in the state Legislature.	mostly false	/colorado/statements/2016/sep/28/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-says-morgan-carroll-racked-11-billion/	The National Republican Congressional Committee is running an ad branding Colorado state Sen. Morgan Carroll as a tax-and-spend Democrat. Carroll is challenging Rep. Mike Coffman, a four-term Republican incumbent in the 6th Congressional District, a crescent-shaped swath of Denver suburbs considered one of the country’s most competitive swing districts. The dark, grainy ad begins with an image of the U.S. Capitol building and the narrator saying, "Washington has a spending problem -- and Morgan Carroll would make it worse." "In the (Colorado) Legislature, Carroll racked up $11 billion in new spending, nearly doubling the state budget," the narrator continues. For this fact-check, we’re focusing on the claim that "Carroll racked up $11 billion dollars in new spending, nearly doubling the state budget," making it sound like she played a key role in the increase. In support of its claim, the NRCC provided documentation showing that when Morgan became a Colorado House member in 2004, the total state budget was $14 billion. The budget grew to $25 billion by 2015 -- and Carroll voted for that budget, NRCC noted. To evaluate the accuracy of the ad’s statement, let’s start with a brief primer on Colorado tax history. Colorado lawmakers are restricted by law in how much they can increase the state budget. In 1992, Colorado voters approved a Taxpayer's Bill of Rights, popularly known as TABOR, a constitutional amendment designed to restrain growth in government. As PolitiFact previously reported, the measure said the government can't spend tax money collected under existing tax rates if revenues grow faster than inflation and population. Instead, the government had to rebate that money to taxpayers. These rebates applied to many types of taxes and business fees, but it primarily affected income and sales taxes. TABOR also required any tax increases to be approved by voters. When the 2001-03 recession hit, TABOR compounded a state government fiscal crisis because of it’s so-called "ratchet effect." As the downturn caused state revenues to drop below the previous year’s spending, TABOR’s rules restricted the government’s spending growth to that lower baseline and state revenues plunged -- even as Colorado’s economic growth rebounded. By 2005, many people believed the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights was hurting basic services, particularly education. So voters were asked to approve Referendum C, allowing government to stop refunding excess revenues for the next five years and permanently eliminating the ratchet effect. The measure drew bipartisan support from Colorado's elected leaders, including then Gov. Bill Owens, a Republican. Anti-tax groups vehemently opposed the measure, saying it was a betrayal of TABOR. The NRCC ad hammers Carroll for raising taxes, citing her vote -- along with a majority of the state Legislature -- to place Referendum C on the ballot. But voters approved Referendum C with 52 percent of the vote, allowing the state to keep about $3.7 billion in revenue that otherwise would have been refunded to taxpayers under TABOR. We looked closer at the claim that Carroll "racked up $11 billion dollars in new spending" by voting for the $25 billion budget in 2015. It’s important to note that about one-third of that $25 billion is federal money, over which state lawmakers have little control. Another 30 percent comes from "cash funds," which is money from fines, fees and limited taxes that are allocated by statute to specific programs, including transportation and health care. Lawmakers exercise most of their control over the state’s general fund, which was $9.6 billion in the 2015-16 fiscal year -- or 38.4 percent of the overall budget. Yet Carroll did vote for the Senate conference committee’s budget bill, which passed on a bipartisan 31-2 vote. What the NRCC ad doesn’t mention is that Republicans control the Senate -- not Democrats like Carroll. Both Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper and Republican Senate leaders praised the bipartisan collaboration on the $25 billion budget that was described as "reasonable, responsible and delivered on time," by Sen. Kent Lambert, the Republican chairman of the the Joint Budget Committee. Outside observers questioned the ad’s suggestion that one lawmaker is responsible for racking up an $11 billion increase in the budget over 11 years in a Legislature that totals 100 lawmakers and experienced changes in which party controlled the governorship, and both legislative chambers during that time. "This claim strikes me as a huge stretch," Seth Masket, chairman of the political science department at the University of Denver, told PolitiFact. "If Carroll is guilty of this, then so is everyone else who served in the Legislature during that time." "Lawmakers are restricted in their ability to increase the budget," he added. "TABOR restricts growth in government spending to where spending was the previous fiscal year, plus inflation and population growth. But basically, the Joint Budget Committee in the Legislature puts together a budget resolution, and Carroll, along with a majority of legislators, voted to approve it." Our ruling The NRCC said Morgan Carroll "racked up $11 billion in new spending," implying that she had a key role in "nearly doubling the state budget." Carroll did vote for a $25 billion budget in 2015, but the Democrat was joined by a vast majority of lawmakers in a Republican-controlled Senate. The budget’s passage was hailed as a bipartisan accomplishment by both parties. Colorado lawmakers are restricted by law in how much they can increase the state budget. While the NRCC ad focuses on the total budget, lawmakers’ control is largely limited to the general fund, which in 2015 was 38.4 percent of the overall budget. The NRCC’s misleading ad exaggerates Carroll’s responsibility for the budget increase. We rule the statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/dcb1cf37-14c7-47c5-8465-1a0b9950a77c	None	National Republican Congressional Committee	None	None	None	2016-09-28T17:18:04	2016-09-22	['Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Colorado']
pomt-04687	Says that like Todd Akin, all Texas Republicans in U.S. House cosponsored a bill "that attempts to distinguish between ‘forcible rape’ and other sexual assaults."	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/sep/06/lone-star-project/pac-says-todd-akin-and-paul-ryan-all-texas-republi/	Amid bipartisan outcry over a Missouri Republican’s reference to "legitimate rape," a pro-Democratic political action committee drew attention to legislation supposedly containing similar language. "Every single member of the Texas Republican congressional delegation cosponsored the same bill supported by (U.S. Rep. Todd) Akin and Paul Ryan that attempts to distinguish between ‘forcible rape’ and other sexual assaults," said a report circulated Aug. 23, 2012, by the Lone Star Project. PolitiFact New Jersey confirmed in an Aug. 22, 2012, item that Akin and Ryan, the Republican vice presidential nominee and Wisconsin House member, co-sponsored the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act in July 2010 and again in January 2011. Both versions were written by U.S. Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., and referred to "forcible" rape; that word was removed from the 2011 bill during congressional deliberations. In all versions of Smith’s legislation, rape or "forcible" rape was mentioned in a section defining exceptions -- that is, cases in which using federal money to pay for abortions would not be prohibited. Lone Star Project researcher Erik Ruselowski emailed us (and we double-checked) that part of the version introduced in the House in 2011: SEC. 309. TREATMENT OF ABORTIONS RELATED TO RAPE, INCEST, OR PRESERVING THE LIFE OF THE MOTHER. The limitations established in sections 301, 302, 303, and 304 shall not apply to an abortion -- (1) if the pregnancy occurred because the pregnant female was the subject of an act of forcible rape or, if a minor, an act of incest; or (2) in the case where the pregnant female suffers from a physical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness that would, as certified by a physician, place the pregnant female in danger of death unless an abortion is performed, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself. According to the text (2010’s HR 5939 and 2011’s HR 3) and numerous news stories about the act we read in the Nexis news database, the main purpose of the legislation was not redefining rape but limiting the use of federal funds to pay for abortion. Seeking background on the term "forcible," we learned that forcible rape was and is listed as a specific crime in some states and, according to a Jan. 6, 2012, Justice Department press release, was from 1927 through 2011 a part of the definition of rape for purposes of the Uniform Crime Report data that law enforcement agencies supply to the FBI. The "longstanding, narrow definition of forcible rape," according to the release, "is ‘the carnal knowledge of a female, forcibly and against her will’ " -- penile penetration of the vagina despite physical resistance by the victim. The new, broader definition is: "The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim." FBI Assistant Director David Cuthbertson said in the release, "This change will give law enforcement the ability to report more complete rape offense data, as the new definition reflects the vast majority of state rape statutes." An Aug. 23, 2012, New York Times news story about Akin’s comment said, "States have been adjusting their definitions of rape for the past 30 years, many moving away from the insistence on evidence of force because most rapes do not result in harm to the woman separate from the act itself." So, what did the failed legislation cited by the Lone Star Project propose to do? Since 1976, federal health appropriations acts have included a modification commonly called the Hyde Amendment, which bars the use of federal dollars to pay for abortions except in cases of rape or incest or to save the mother’s life. Republicans said the Democratic-steered federal health care overhaul, signed into law by President Barack Obama in March 2010, did not provide enough protections against federal money being used to pay for abortions. One focus of the concerns was state-level insurance "exchanges" established by the act, in which private insurance companies could compete for the business of people not insured through employers. A Jan. 1, 2011, Boston Globe news story quoted Smith as saying that without an additional change in law, "we are setting up a funding scheme to pay for abortions." According to the congressional database, Smith’s 2010 bill was short-lived and his amended 2011 bill won approval in the Republican-majority House by a 251-175 vote, with all Republicans and 16 Democrats in favor, but stalled in the Democratic-majority Senate. Notably, the description of rape in Smith’s proposal went farther than the Hyde Amendment, which did not use the word "forcible" but stated simply that abortions are exempted from the bill’s funding restrictions when the pregnancy threatens the mother’s life or is the result of incest or rape. Soon after Smith introduced the bill Jan. 20, 2011, critics called attention to its use of the phrase "forcible rape." A Feb. 1, 2011, Washington Post news story reported that women’s groups objected to the word "forcible" in HR 3: "Critics say the modifier could distinguish it from other kinds of sexual assault that are typically recognized as rape, including statutory rape and attacks that occur because of drugs or verbal threats." The Post quoted cosponsor Rep. Daniel Lipinski, D-Ill., as saying the bill "was not intended to change existing law regarding taxpayer funding for abortion in cases of rape, nor is it expected that it would do so." However, Smith quickly agreed to delete the word because, the Post reported in a Feb. 3, 2011, news story, it was being "misconstrued." A CBS news story the same day quoted Smith spokesman Jeff Sagnip: "The word ‘forcible’ will be replaced with the original language from the Hyde Amendment." House Judiciary Committee press secretary Charlotte Sellmyer told us by email, "The bill was officially amended when the amendment was voted on in committee, which was March 3, 2011." In a phone interview, Lone Star Project founder Matt Angle told us that when he wrote the PAC’s report, he was referring to the Texas members of the U.S. House (the only group that could co-sponsor a bill with House members Akin and Ryan) cosponsoring the act when it was reintroduced Jan. 20, 2011, and afterwards before "forcible" was deleted. "Everybody from District 1, Gohmert, to District 32, Pete Sessions, and all the Republicans in between," Angle said. For perspective, we checked the cosponsors of both the 2010 and 2011 introductions of the bill using THOMAS, the congressional database. The version introduced July 29, 2010, included among its eventual 186 cosponsors all 20 Texas Republicans plus two Democrats -- Solomon Ortiz of Corpus Christi and Henry Cuellar of Laredo -- from the 32-member Texas delegation. The 20 Texas Republicans were, listed by district number, Louie Gohmert of Tyler, Ted Poe of Humble, Sam Johnson of Plano, Ralph Hall of Rockwall, Jeb Hensarling of Dallas, Joe Barton of Ennis, John Culberson of Houston, Kevin Brady of The Woodlands, Michael McCaul of Austin, Michael Conaway of Midland, Kay Granger of Fort Worth, Mac Thornberry of Clarendon, Ron Paul of Lake Jackson, Randy Neugebauer of Lubbock, Lamar Smith of San Antonio, Pete Olson of Sugar Land, Kenny Marchant of Coppell, Michael Burgess of Lewisville, John Carter of Round Rock and Pete Sessions of Dallas. Voters in November 2010 elected three additional Republicans to the Texas delegation. And in 2011, all 23 Texas Republicans in the House but no Texas Democrats were among the 227 legislators who eventually signed on as cosponsors of Smith’s HR 3. The Texas cosponsors were the 20 Republicans from 2010 plus GOP freshmen Bill Flores of Bryan, Francisco "Quico" Canseco of San Antonio and Blake Farenthold of Corpus Christi. Seventeen of the Texans were original cosponsors. Five joined Feb. 8, 2011. The last one, however, got on board March 8 -- after the deletion of "forcible." The latecomer was Culberson, whose office offered no comment when we asked about his timing. We looped back to Angle with our findings on the cosponsors and the intent of the bill. Angle told us that he believes the Texas Republicans showed by cosponsoring the bill that they supported making a legal distinction between rape and forcible rape. Our ruling Except for Culberson in 2011, all Texas Republicans in the House cosponsored versions of the legislation using the word "forcible." But, absent from the PAC’s claim is the fact that two Texas Democrats cosponsored the 2010 proposal, which dampens the suggestion that Republicans alone were committing to placing "forcible" rape into the proposal. And though the PAC said the "bill ... attempts to distinguish between ‘forcible rape’ and other sexual assaults," redefining rape was not the proposal’s purpose. Also, its author agreed to delete the term when critics singled it out. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Lone Star Project	None	None	None	2012-09-06T10:51:41	2012-08-23	['Todd_Akin', 'Texas']
pomt-02422	"Florida high schools are four out of the top 10 in the entire United States."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/mar/04/rick-scott/four-nations-top-10-high-schools-are-florida-rick-/	Gov. Rick Scott has positioned himself as a public education cheerleader as he prepares to face the voters in November. After facing criticism for slashing school spending in 2011, Scott later called for education funding increases and teacher raises. Now in his fourth State of the State address on March 4, 2014, he boasted about the national rankings of our high schools. "Florida high schools are four out of the top 10 in the entire United States," Scott said. We wanted to determine if Scott was correct about the ranking of our high schools. Rankings of high schools Scott’s claim comes from Newsweek’s ranking of "America’s Best High Schools," which looked at public schools and was released in May 2013. Four Florida high schools ranked in the top 10: • No. 2: International Baccalaureate School at Bartow High, Bartow • No. 6: School for Advanced Studies, Miami • No. 9: Suncoast Community High School, Riviera Beach • No. 10: Stanton College Preparatory School, Jacksonville Newsweek invited more than 5,000 high schools to participate and about half responded. The rankings are based on graduation and college acceptance rates, and average SAT/ACT scores based on data from 2011-12 school year. Other factors include scores and enrollment in certain classes such as advancement placement and international baccalaureate. Another often-cited ranking, though, comes from U.S. News and World Report, which uses a different methodology -- and not surprisingly that leads to different results for Florida schools. This ranking, based on data from the 2010-11 school year, shows only one in the top 10 from Florida: Pine View School in Osprey. U.S. News rankings, done together with the American Institutes for Research, cover more than 21,000 public high schools. This analysis takes into account several factors that relate to how a school’s students perform on reading and math tests, including taking into account economically disadvantaged students and minorities. It also examines Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate test data. Education Week, a respected publication in the education field, gives an average grade to each state as a whole. Education Week gave Florida a "C" for K-12 achievement, ranking the state at seventh in the country. Education experts We sent Scott’s claim to several education experts to ask their opinion on the Newsweek and U.S. News rankings. None of them embraced these rankings, and they offered several criticisms and caveats. Matthew Di Carlo, an education policy at the Albert Shanker Institute, cautioned that Newsweek’s data from schools is self-reported and only takes into account a small portion of the nation’s high schools. The indicators measured such as graduation and college acceptance rates are predominantly a function of student background. Jeffrey Henig, a Columbia education professor, said that the Newsweek rankings don’t control for certain factors such as socioeconomic status and whether the schools have competitive entry requirements -- as does the school from Miami on the list. "All 'best school' lists have flaws and most have serious ones," Henig said. "Ranking systems that look at test scores or graduation rates or similar outcome measures, without considering the characteristics of the student populations they serve, tell us little about whether listed schools are good ones, and tell us absolutely nothing about the quality of the state systems in which they are located." Our ruling Scott said that "Florida high schools are four out of the top 10 in the entire United States." Newsweek’s rankings released in 2013 support Scott's claim. But education experts say there are several caveats about using that ranking, which is based on self-reported data for a fraction of the nation’s schools. There also are other rankings under which Florida doesn’t fare as well -- for example, the U.S. News rankings include only one Florida school in the top 10, while Education Week gave Florida a "C" for K-12 education statewide.

pomt-06461	"Since 1970, the Clean Air Act has reduced toxic and health-threatening air pollution by 60 percent while our economy has grown more than 200 percent."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/oct/19/hank-johnson/going-green-helps-bring-green-congressman-says/	A recent environmental flare-up in Congress drew the ire of one Georgia representative and an opportunity to dust off the Truth-O-Meter. U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson recently used his website to voice his outrage about a bill called the TRAIN Act. The bill passed the House of Representatives in late September with strong support by Republicans who said the act is needed to examine Obama administration environmental policies they say have resulted in higher oil, gas and coal prices. The bill, as of late last week, was in the U.S. Senate’s Committee on Environment and Public Works. Johnson, a DeKalb County Democrat, said the bill would block "two of the most important, life-saving Clean Air rules in decades -- the mercury and air toxics rule and cross-state air pollution rule." The congressman then argued it’s false to claim strong environmental regulations hurt big business and used some numbers to back up his case. "Since 1970, the Clean Air Act has reduced toxic and health-threatening air pollution by 60 percent while our economy has grown more than 200 percent," Johnson said. So are Johnson’s numbers correct? The congressman’s office said the information we wanted to check came from the American Lung Association. A spokesman for the association referred us to an Environmental Protection Agency report last year that found emissions for six common pollutants had declined by 63 percent since 1970. The EPA report also found the nation’s gross domestic product has increased by 204 percent in that same time frame. Several experts we spoke with said the EPA’s numbers were on target and had no quarrels with the federal agency’s research. "I think [Johnson] is on point," said Lynn Goldman, dean of the George Washington University School of Health Services. On the economic growth part of the claim, two local economics experts we interviewed thought that number was on target, too. They both looked at GDP data that was adjusted for inflation. Christine Ries, who teaches economics at Georgia Tech, said gross domestic product is the measure most commonly used to measure economic growth. Georgia State University economics department chairwoman Sally Wallace also found no problem with the math in Johnson’s statement. She did suggest we look at per capita income to examine the second part of the congressman’s claim. The growth in that category was also above 200 percent, from $19,167 in 1970 to the 2010 per capita income of $40,584. Johnson’s statement seems to imply that the Clean Air Act did not hurt the economy or even helped it. Wallace wasn’t sure a direct correlation can be made. She researched GDP 10 years before the Clean Air Act passed and the 40 years since and concluded that the average annual growth was greater before 1970. "It’s kind of difficult to say it’s directly related," Wallace told us. Two groups joined forces last year to research the economic impact of the Clean Air Act. The Small Business Majority, an advocacy group for the nation’s 28 million small businesses, and the Main Street Alliance, a national coalition of small business networks in 15 states, concluded in its 10-page report that about 1.3 million jobs were created between 1977 and 1991 as a result of environmental regulations from the Clean Air Act. Using some EPA data, they believe the Clean Air Act’s benefits far outweighed the costs. The report criticized congressional efforts to scale back the EPA’s authority under the Clean Air Act. For years, as a 2001 paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research noted, manufacturers have argued whether the act puts them at a competitive disadvantage globally. The report by the widely cited think tank looked at 15 years of data and concluded that the regulations "retard industrial activity." Johnson is correct in his statement about the Clean Air Act’s impact on pollution. The rest of his argument was aimed at countering claims that strong environmental policies hurt business. The numbers the congressman used seem to be on target, but there’s some room for debate about the Clean Air Act’s impact on the economy. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-02108	Says Hillary Clinton spent 30 days in the hospital in 2012 and appeared "wearing glasses that are only for people who have traumatic brain injury."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/may/14/karl-rove/rove-clinton-hospital-stay-and-glasses-point-traum/	If Hillary Clinton decides to run for president, she knows every bit of her life will be put under a microscope. Republican strategist and Fox News commentator Karl Rove proved the point at an event near Los Angeles last Thursday. In remarks reported in the New York Post, Rove raised questions about Clinton’s health following a mild concussion in 2012. "Thirty days in the hospital," Rove said. "And when she reappears, she's wearing glasses that are only for people who have traumatic brain injury? We need to know what's up with that." Many people took Rove’s comments to mean that he thinks Clinton has a brain injury, though Rove says he was just raising the question and that it should be part of any presidential vetting. There are two points for us to cover in this fact check -- the time Clinton spent in the hospital and the nature of the glasses she wore for weeks afterward. (She doesn’t wear them now.) First, the background. In December 2012, a stomach virus kept Clinton at home where she fainted and hit her head. During a follow-up visit, doctors spotted a blood clot, admitted her to the hospital and treated her with blood thinners. Clinton was in the hospital for about four days, not 30, a point Rove got wrong. (In a subsequent interview, Rove said it was a "30-day period where she’s fighting something.") Clinton testified near the end of January at a House hearing on the Benghazi, Libya, attack, and was seen wearing the glasses Rove referred to. A State Department spokesman said they were related to issues stemming from her concussion. The peculiar shape of one of the lenses led experts and doctors to conclude they were prismatic glasses. The glasses are designed to help with blurred or double vision, experts told us. We spoke with Steven Galetta, who is chair of the Neurology Department at New York University Medical Center. "About 30 to 50 percent of concussions lead to some kind of visual problem," Galetta said. "When there’s double vision, we can manage it by putting a prism over one eye. It bends the light to line up the image from the other eye." Galetta said the glasses are often optional. Whether someone wears them depends on how quickly the person wants to get back to work. "Most patients resolve (the issues) on their own," he said. "I’d say 85 to 90 percent of these patients do incredibly well and have no recognizable symptoms afterwards." Given Clinton’s job as Secretary of State, Galetta said he could see why her doctors might have jumped in to deal with her complaint. Rove exagerated the tie between the glasses and trauma. Galetta said such lenses are used in cases other than traumatic brain injury. Anything that affects the ocular motor nerves or the way the eyes work together can produce double vision that then might be treated with prismatic glasses. So while Rove said the glasses are used "only" for people with traumatic brain injury, doctors say that is incorrect. More broadly, Rove’s characterization of Clinton’s concussion as a traumatic brain injury generated a bit of concern among the physicians we reached. Doug Smith is a professor of neurosurgery and director of the Center for Brain Injury and Repair at the University of Pennsylvania. Smith said the public might not understand how broadly the term applies. The Centers for Disease Control report that 2.2 million head injuries sent people to the emergency room in 2010. "Technically, a concussion is a mild traumatic brain injury," Smith said. "But Rove made a linkage that doesn’t fit. Having a concussion and wearing those glasses tell you nothing about a person’s cognitive status. The vast majority of people with concussions make a full recovery." Our ruling Rove said Clinton spent 30 days in the hospital and then emerged wearing glasses that only people with traumatic brain injury use. Rove since said he was wrong about the length of her hospital stay. The actual number is four days. By describing a long hospital stay and tying it to signs of traumatic brain injury, Rove associated Clinton with a more profound medical episode. Experts reject that association. Concussions are the mildest form of traumatic brain injury. The glasses Clinton wore are an optional treatment for temporary problems of double vision that are relatively common among people who suffer concussions along with other conditions. She has not worn the glasses for some time, and the neurologists we contacted said most people recover fully. While Rove never claimed Clinton suffered brain damage, he was wrong about the hospital stay and combined that with the glasses to exaggerate the nature of Clinton’s injury. His claim is inaccurate. We rate it False.	None	Karl Rove	None	None	None	2014-05-14T10:48:47	2014-05-08	['None']
pomt-02161	"A lot of the problems with forest fires ... is because of bad policy (not to clear out the forests) that was put in place by environmentalists."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/may/01/dana-perino/perino-faults-enviros-mega-fires/	America gets a lot of wildfires. Some of them hit grassy rangelands, some hit forests, most are small but some are huge. The 2011 Wallow forest fire in Arizona destroyed over half a million acres. Since 2000, the country has averaged nearly 75,000 fires a year with over 80 million acres lost. There are many causes but Dana Perino, former press secretary to President George W. Bush, focused on just one. Last week on Fox News’ The Five, the conversation turned to climate change and in the middle of making the case that economic growth had to be part of any solution, Perino made a passing reference to fires. "A lot of the problems with forest fires, the major raging ones that happen in the West," Perino said, "Is because of bad policy that was put in place by environmentalists and not clear out the forests." We tried to reach Perino to ask her what she meant by "a lot" and what policies she had in mind. We did not hear from her. In this fact-check, we dig into the rich debate over the role of environmentalists and wildfires. In particular, we aim to see if fire damage would have been substantially less if environmental policies were different. This question is as vast as the nearly 200 million acres managed by U.S. Forest Service, but we found that extensive drought and vast amounts of combustible material played a key role. And what about governments failing to proactively clear out forests? The consensus suggests a mix of factors that include fire policies dating back to the early 1900s and limited budgets to reduce fire hazards. What’s less clear is the role of environmental activists and environmental policies. It is true that environmental regulations and legal challenges by environmental activists frequently delay the work of the Forest Service. It is difficult to say if these delays played a major role in the large fires the country has experienced. Let’s take a look at the big picture, starting with the role of environmentalists. The environmental factor To John Barnwell, director of policy for the Society of American Foresters, a professional education group, the lack of money to prevent fires is primary. But environmentalists and their actions play a role. Barnwell chafes at the long environmental review process and frequent litigation over Environmental Impact Statements that beset the Forest Service. A 2010 analysis from Western Michigan University found that no other agency tops the Forest Service for the number of suits under the National Environmental Policy Act. It averaged about 100 legal challenges each year. In some well-known cases (think of the Spotted Owl in the Pacific Northwest), logging ground to a halt entirely due to environmental protection rules under the Endangered Species Act. Timber harvests on federal land are a fraction of what they were in late 1970s. Ann Camp, a forestry scientist at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, says national environmental groups seem to be intractable to compromise. "I can tell you from experience that local environmentalists and local chapters of national environmental organizations have been on board for some activities," Camp said. "But the national chapters nixed their involvement and had already decided to contest the outcome -- whatever it was if it included any level of harvesting." We found the case of a New Mexico fire where a Forest Service thinning project that might have reduced the damage was delayed by appeals from two environmental groups. On the other hand, we also found examples where environmental groups worked hand in hand with loggers and state and national officials to move many projects forward. And Camp noted that some large fires took place in remote areas where no logging of any sort had ever been planned. Plus, fires have struck in forests where extensive harvests took place. There is no question that environmental rules and lawsuits delay and sometimes block activities on federal lands, but it is difficult to prove that absent those moves that the western states would have avoided their mega fires. And there are several other factors that play a more prominent role, experts say. The paradox of too little fire When Congress wants an impartial analysis, it turns to its in-house think tank, the Congressional Research Service. In 2012, the CRS looked at the causes of wildfire damage. That report said the roots of recent mega fires are "excess biomass in the forests, due to past logging and grazing and a century of fire suppression, combined with an expanding wildland-urban interface — more people and houses in and near the forests — and climate change, exacerbating drought and insect and disease problems." A huge part of the reason we see huge fires today, the CRS report and experts say, is that we were too quick to put out fires. Around 1910 a series of massive fires wiped out entire towns. In two days, Washington, Montana, and Idaho lost 3 million acres of woodland. The fires led to a cry for the federal government to beef up its efforts to put fires out as quickly as possible. "Our forestry tradition comes from central Europe, which has always had a paradigm that fire was bad for forests," Camp said. Historically, periodic fires cleared out the undergrowth while allowing mature, healthy trees to survive. But with the focus on keeping fires small (the mantra was to put out every fire by 10 a.m. the day after it was reported), the amount of combustible material grew. The growth of grazing livestock also reduced naturally occurring fires by creating gaps in the terrain that stopped a fire from spreading. The result: In the 1800s, a natural stand of Ponderosa Pine, a common species in the West, might have a few dozen trees per acre. Today, hundreds of smaller trees might be squeezed into the same area. When fire hits, it burns hotter and moves faster. Instead of running along the ground, it jumps into the crown of the trees where the winds drive it even more. Many millions of acres of forest face this risk. It wasn’t until the 1970s that Forest Service policy began to shift in earnest toward viewing fire as a potential ally in managing the forests. But today, the Forest Service describes this legacy as the equivalent of a toxic dump. A hazard that built up over decades remains in place and is potentially lethal. Too little water The new millennium opened with an extended drought that left much of the western United States primed for fire. Peter Brown, a researcher at Colorado State University, has studied the fingerprints of fires over the centuries in the growth rings of trees. "Fire is driven by climate," Brown said. "The first thing you need, besides something like a lightning strike for ignition, is dry conditions." The years from 2000 to 2004 were spectacularly dry. Colorado State researchers said the drought was the strongest in 800 years. It killed trees, made the ones that lived more vulnerable to insects and turned the ground cover into tinder. The 2011 Wallow fire in Arizona came after a winter with little precipitation. The combination of dry ground, dry wood and grasses and strong winds produced a fire that in five weeks burned as many acres as had burned in the previous 25 years. Too little money, too much land The federal government has tried to come to terms with the legacy of a management policy that left too much fuel in the forests. Just as the nation was entering one its worst periods of fire, the Forest Service laid out an ambitious plan to clear away that excess scrub, brush and small trees. Called the 2000 Cohesive Strategy, it aimed to use controlled burns and physical removal to treat 6.9 million acres per year. An assessment by Northern Arizona University’s Ecological Restoration Institute highlighted the gap between that goal and the reality. In 2011, the agency planned to reduce the risk of fire in an additional 960,000 acres. "Th­e number of acres treated in Fiscal Year 2011 is not even close to number of acres proposed per year in the 2000 Cohesive Strategy, or that are needed to reduce the threat of catastrophic fire at the landscape scale," the assessment said. At the heart of this problem is money. Barnwell said the Forest Service has been so busy fighting fires, it has needed to use the money that had been budgeted to prevent them. "Over the past 10 years, they borrowed $3.4 billion from other activities to pay for fire suppression," Barnwell said. "Congress will put some of that back, but they’ve missed a season to do really important work. They can never get ahead." We found wide agreement that these fire prevention projects need to take place on a very large scale if they are to tamp down on the mega fires. The Congressional Research Service advised that the odds make it unlikely that the land you clear will be the one where a fire will take hold -- there are just too many acres to cover. By the CRS’ count, the odds that any given acre will catch fire are no more than 1 out of 100. Thus, you have to treat a lot of acres and that has not happened. Lastly, Perino broadly faulted policies "put in place by environmentalists." But both the National Environmental Policy Act (1969) and the Endangered Species Act (1973) passed either unanimously or with overwhelming bipartisan support. President Ronald Reagan signed significant revisions into law. Perino’s characterization seems like an oversimplification. Our ruling Perino said, "A lot of the problems with forest fires is because of bad policy that was put in place by environmentalists." The crux of this fact-check really comes down to how you define "a lot." While the record shows that the need for environmental impact statements and legal challenges have a significant impact on Forest Service projects on federal lands, the connection to the extreme fires of the past 15 years is less certain. Where we found broad consensus is that decades of aggressively putting out every fire as quickly as possible, and the use of land for grazing, created circumstances where the forests are brimming with fuel. That in conjunction with extended dry periods have turned them into tinderboxes. The federal strategy to remove that fuel runs up against budget constraints. The limited money is a much greater constraint than environmental policies. In the end, experts acknowledge that environmental policies are an issue, but they generally tip the scale toward other factors when assigning blame. Perino’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate her claim Mostly False. Update: The Forest Service drew funds from other programs over a 10-year period to pay for fire suppression. A previous version of this fact-check was unclear on this point..

pomt-11607	"They found 60 votes in the Senate in 2006 and 2013" for immigration legislation, and "each time the House Republican majority refused to take it up."	true	/punditfact/statements/2018/jan/26/ronald-brownstein/did-senators-pass-immigration-reform-bills-2006-20/	In a discussion about the recent three-day government shutdown — due to lawmakers' disagreement over federal funding and policies for young immigrants in the country illegally, so-called Dreamers — pundit Ronald Brownstein said that while many Americans want Dreamers to stay, it’s unclear if that can be achieved. Twice before, senators have agreed on immigration reform, but each time, the prospect fell through without action from the U.S. House of Representatives, said Brownstein, a senior political analyst for CNN. "They probably can find 60 votes in the Senate to do that. They found 60 votes in the Senate in 2006 and 2013 for immigration reform. And each time the House Republican majority refused to take it up," said Brownstein, who’s also senior editor at The Atlantic. "Without the president's leverage, without him leaning on House Republicans, you could easily see the same thing again." The Dreamers are in limbo after the Trump administration rescinded a program that prevented their deportation. President Donald Trump has tweeted that "nobody knows for sure" if a deal will be reached and that it must include funding for his border wall with Mexico. Is Brownstein right about the 2006 and 2013 immigration push? He’s got his history right, and we thought it was worth reviewing in depth. May 2006: Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006, 62-36 The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 passed in the Senate on May 25, 2006, along a 62-36 vote. The bill included provisions to strengthen border security with fencing, vehicle barriers, surveillance technology and more personnel; a new temporary worker visa category; and a path to legal status for immigrants in the country illegally if they met specific criteria. Then-President George W. Bush commended the Senate "for passing bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform" and said he looked forward to working with both chambers. But the bill was never taken up by the House. The House in December 2005 passed a separate bill with greater focus on border security and enforcement, the Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005. That proposal narrowed in on employment eligibility verification; immigration fraud; and immigration enforcement authority at state and local levels. It did not include a guest worker program or the legalization of immigrants. Instead of voting on the Senate bill, House Republican leaders held a series of summer "field hearings" to get the public to weigh in on controversial provisions in the Senate bill, which Republicans labeled as amnesty. ''Our No. 1 priority is to secure the border,'' then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert, of Illinois, said in June 2006. "And right now I haven't heard a lot of pressure to have a path to citizenship.'' In September 2006, after meeting with Republican leaders, Hastert said they agreed "that we cannot support totally" a lot of the provisions in the Senate bill, because it "would not secure the border. Matter of fact, it erased the border." Lawmakers from both chambers never formed a conference committee to iron out the details in both bills and the proposals expired at the end of the 109th Congress. June 2013: Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, 68-32 Backed by Democrats and 14 Republicans, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act passed the Senate on a 68-32 vote on June 27, 2013. The bill directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit two reports on border security strategy, including one on where fencing, infrastructure and technology should be used; authorized the use of the National Guard to help secure the border; called for an increase in the number of Border Patrol agents at the southern border, and other border security measures. It also included provisions to allow immigrants in the country illegally to adjust their immigration status, if they met certain criteria. "The bipartisan bill that passed today was a compromise … Today, the Senate did its job. It’s now up to the House to do the same," said then-President Barack Obama. But House Republicans again opposed the Senate immigration proposal, arguing that border security needed to be addressed first before legalizing the status of millions of immigrants. "I’ve made it clear and I’ll make it clear again, the House does not intend to take up the Senate bill," then-House Speaker John Boehner said July 2013. "The House is going to do its own job in developing an immigration bill." He reiterated his position in November 2013: "The idea that we’re going to take up a 1,300-page bill that no one had ever read, which is what the Senate did, is not going to happen in the House," Boehner said. "And frankly, I’ll make clear we have no intention of ever going to conference on the Senate bill." Our ruling Brownstein said, "They found 60 votes in the Senate in 2006 and 2013" for immigration legislation, and "each time the House Republican majority refused to take it up." Senators did pass immigration bills in 2006 and 2013 with 62 and 68 votes, respectively. Both times, House Republicans did not address the proposals on the House floor.

pomt-14324	"It’s actually easier for the United States to get flight manifests from E.U. nations than it is for E.U. nations to get them from their own neighbors, thanks to an agreement the U.S. negotiated when I was secretary of state."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/29/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-us-negotiated-agreement-made-it-ea/	The United States needs to work more closely with Europe to stymie international terrorism, especially stopping westerners from flocking to the Islamic State, said Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. The recent terrorist attack in Belgium, not six months after the Paris attacks, has raised concerns about European security and intelligence sharing. At a March 23 speech in California, Clinton highlighted some perceived security deficiencies among European Union nations. "It’s actually easier for the United States to get flight manifests from E.U. nations than it is for E.U. nations to get them from their own neighbors, thanks to an agreement the U.S. negotiated when I was secretary of state," she said. This claim intrigued us, so we reached out to some experts to see if Clinton was on target. Clinton is talking about the United States–European Union Agreement on Passenger Name Records, a bilateral measure intended to increase the government’s ability to track who is coming into the country. The agreement was signed in 2011 and went into effect in 2012, when Clinton was in office. As a result of this agreement, the European Union provides the United States Department of Homeland Security with passenger name records for every flight from a European Union country to the United States, and vice versa. Passenger name records are essentially very detailed flight manifests, containing information like how far in advance travelers bought their tickets, whether they made specific seat requests and even how many bags they checked. (The European Union has similar agreements with Canada and Australia.) Every expert we queried pointed out that much of the negotiation legwork on this agreement took place before Clinton joined the State Department in 2009. Though the agreement currently in effect was finalized while Clinton headed the State Department, this was the final in a series of negotiations and precursor agreements spanning about a decade following the Sept. 11, 2001, World Trade Center attacks. The standing 2012 version responded to Europeans’ information privacy concerns, and this final push happened during Clinton’s tenure. "The agreement that Clinton was involved in is the culmination of successive agreements, beginning with the impact of 9/11," said Mai’a Cross, an expert in European foreign and security policy at Northeastern University. So, while Clinton's role is up for some debate, the United States does get flight manifests from the E.U. But Clinton also said that all E.U. nations don't share that information with each other. That's accurate, at least for right now. U.S. law requires passenger name record data for any flight entering or leaving the country, but the European Union currently does not. And flight information collection policies are not universal among all 28 European Union members. For example, the United Kingdom has had its own passenger name record system in place for incoming flights, noted Kaija Schilde, an expert on Europe and transatlantic security at Boston University. She added that this issue is further complicated by the Schengen Area, a group of 26 European countries that allow passport-free travel between member countries. So if the United States wants passenger information about a flight from Germany to the New York City, that is an easier get than if Germany wants the same passenger information about a flight from Italy, said Eva-Maria Maggi, a European Union expert at the University of Arizona. This is a result of the U.S.-E.U. agreement but also the fact that the European Union doesn’t have a passenger name record policy similar to the United States, Maggi said. To be clear, the United States does not collect this information for flights that do not enter or leave the United States, like an Italy to Germany flight. Proponents of a European Union-wide system say one of the benefits of such a system is that it would harmonize these differences among member nations. In fact, one such system is on the table, and experts told us the European Parliament will likely approve it in the next couple months. In direct response to the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, the Council of the European Union approved text for a policy that would require passenger name record data for all international flights entering or leaving the European Union. The law would also allow, but not require, member states to collect passenger name records for flights between member countries. Cross noted that passenger name records are just a narrow slice of intelligence information. "If you’re talking intelligence sharing more generally, there has been more sharing within Europe than with other countries," she said. Our ruling Clinton said, "It’s actually easier for the United States to get flight manifests from E.U. nations than it is for E.U. nations to get them from their own neighbors, thanks to an agreement the U.S. negotiated when I was secretary of state." Clinton’s claim is, for the most part, on target. The European Union has an agreement with the United States to provide passenger name records for all U.S.-E.U. air travel. While this was mostly negotiated before Clinton took office, the final push happened in 2011, when she was serving as secretary of state. Countries within the European Union do not have a uniform passenger name record collection policy, so they might not be able to share the same information amongst each other as easily. However, the European Union is on the verge of enacting a policy that would require passenger name record collection for all flights entering and leaving the union. We rate Clinton’s claim Mostly True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-03-29T18:13:07	2016-03-23	['United_States']
pomt-09020	"At his father's bank, Alexi made tens of millions in risky loans to convicted mobsters. Then, the bank collapsed."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/08/mark-kirk/senate-candidate-mark-kirk-says-rival-gave-mobster/	In a mud-slinging fest in the race for President Barack Obama's old Illinois U.S. Senate seat, U.S. Rep. Mark Kirk, the Republican candidate, has hammered Democratic opponent Alexi Giannoulias for his tenure working as a senior loan officer for his family's Broadway Bank. In a Kirk campaign TV ad called "Risky," the announcer says, "At his father's bank, Alexi made tens of millions in risky loans to convicted mobsters. Then, the bank collapsed." We decided to weigh in because this has been the most frequent attack on Giannoulias. And because we like the nicknames. Let's start with Michael "Jaws" Giorango. He was convicted in 1991 of federal bookmaking charges in Chicago. His business with Broadway Bank began long before Giannoulias joined the bank as vice president and a senior loan officer, a job he held from 2002 to 2006. But according to a March 2, 2010, story in the Chicago Tribune -- which has done much of the investigative heavy-lifting here -- Giorango and his new partner, Demitri Stavropoulos, came to the bank in mid 2004, and during a 14-month period when Giannoulias was a senior loan officer, secured about $20 million in new loans. As Broadway was financing land deals in Chicago, Florida, California and South Carolina, Stavropoulos in 2005 began a two-year sentence on a felony conviction for running a multi-state bookmaking ring, while Giorango served time for promoting a nationwide prostitution scheme, the Chicago Tribune found. In July 2009, Broadway Bank filed foreclosure lawsuits seeking to recoup $12.9 million in defaulted loans made to the pair. So there's no question that these were "risky" loans, as the ad put it. But what was Giannoulias' role in these loans? He was a senior loan officer at the bank at the time, but there's no evidence he approved them. In an interview with the Chicago Tribune, Giannoulias' older brother, Demetris Giannoulias, the bank's president and CEO, said he established Broadway's relationship with Giorango in the mid 1990s. And Alexi Giannoulias maintains that throughout his association with the bank, the client relationship with Giorango was managed by Alexi’s father and brother. "In a case like this, where Alexi had no role in managing the client relationship, his responsibilities were more administrative, like getting appraisals ordered and loan documents prepared, coordinating with attorneys, and preparing commitment letters," said Matt McGrath, a spokesman for the Giannoulias campaign. Initially, Giannoulias downplayed his relationship with Giorango as someone he had met at the bank a few times. But in April, Giannoulias said he traveled to Miami to inspect property the bank had financed for Giorango and met with him there, the Tribune reported. In addition to Giorango, the other two ne'er-do-wells pictured in the Kirk ad are former state Sen. John D'Arco and Boris Stratievsky. D'Arco -- convicted of federal corruption charges -- came into play because his name appeared in legal documents in connection with a Giorango company that purchased the Lorraine Hotel in Miami Beach. According to a 2006 story in Crain's Chicago Business, however, Broadway Bank released a statement saying that D’Arco's name does not appear on mortgage papers, "has never been a loan applicant, recipient, co-signer, guarantor or customer" of Broadway, and does not hold an ownership share in the hotel deal. According to Giannoulias' spokesman McGrath, "the Giorango loans included money that went to the purchase of the Lorraine Hotel in Miami in 2001, a land deal which state Sen. John D'Arco was involved in with Giorango." Giannoulias, however, "joined the bank in 2002 after graduating from law school, so this transaction predated his time there." Which brings us to reputed Russian mobsters Lev and Boris Stratievsky. According to a March 13, 2010, story in the Chicago Sun-Times, Giannoulias signed off on $20 million in loans to the father and son. According to McGrath, Giannoulias was not on the loan committee that approved the loans and he did not manage the bank's relationship with them. More importantly, McGrath correctly noted, Lev and Boris "Half Dollar" Stratievsky had no criminal background at the time of the loans. Boris Stratievsky pleaded guilty in May 2008 to federal money-laundering charges, and Lev has since died. "Even a criminal background check wouldn't have turned anything up," McGrath said. So it would be incorrect to say, as the ad did, that Stratievsky was a "convicted mobster" when Broadway Bank made him a loan. One last point. The ad says "At his father's bank, Alexi made tens of millions in risky loans to convicted mobsters. Then, the bank collapsed." The bank did collapse. On April 23, 2010, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) announced that Broadway Bank was closed by the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, which appointed the FDIC as receiver. According to a press release, "the FDIC and MB Financial Bank, National Association entered into a loss-share transaction on $878.4 million of Broadway Bank's assets." And the FDIC estimated the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund will be $394.3 million. The ad, however, suggests that risky loans to mobsters caused the bank collapse, and that's a big stretch. More accurately, the bank invested heavily in construction and development and could not weather the collapse of the real estate market. The losses sustained in loans made to Giorango while Giannoulias was a senior loan officer, while substantial, were a relative drop in the bucket in the overall scheme of the bank's woes. In summary, D'Arco's involvement involved a loan that predated Giannoulias' time at Broadway Bank. Stratievsky had not been charged with anything when Broadway made loans to him. As for Giorango, his relationship with Broadway Bank began long before Giannoulias came on board. But as the Chicago Tribune detailed, the bank made Giorango an additional $20 million in new loans while Giannoulias was a senior loan officer. There's no evidence Giannouias approved the loans, but he did some work on them. Still, we think it's awfully misleading to suggest losses on risky loans to convicted felons led to the bank's demise (though they certainly didn't help). In all, we think that all shakes out to a Half True.	None	Mark Kirk	None	None	None	2010-07-08T18:28:08	2010-06-30	['None']
pomt-08496	Harry Reid "voted to use taxpayer dollars to pay for Viagra for convicted child molesters and sex offenders."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/08/sharron-angle/sharron-angle-attacks-harry-reid-over-giving-sex-o/	Judging by her newest television ad, Sharron Angle, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate from Nevada, is banking on the idea that even Sin City voters have limits on acceptable behavior. In an ad released Oct. 7, 2010, Angle accuses Harry Reid of voting to use taxpayer dollars to pay for Viagra for convicted child molesters and sex offenders. The ad begins by attacking Reid on immigration, repeating a charge from one of Angle's earlier ads that Reid voted "to give illegal aliens special tax breaks and Social Security benefits." When the initial ad came out, we rated those claims False and Barely True, respectively. In this article, we'll focus on the Viagra claim. The narrator says, "Here's the kicker: Reid actually voted to use taxpayer dollars to pay for Viagra for convicted child molesters and sex offenders. What else could you ever need to know about Harry Reid?" Our friends at PolitiFact Texas analyzed a similar -- but not identical -- claim in June, so we'll rely in part on their reporting. The charge stems from the health care law passed by Congress earlier this year. By 2014, states must create exchanges in which individuals can buy insurance from a choice of four plans that must meet minimum standards, although premiums, out-of-pocket costs and benefits may differ. To limit costs for indigent residents, premiums and costs such as deductibles and co-payments will be subsidized for people with incomes between 133 to 400 percent of the federal poverty level, which in 2009 ranged from $29,327 to $88,200 for a family of four. For instance, people with incomes at or below 150 percent of the federal poverty level will only be responsible for one-third of their out-of-pocket costs; the federal government will pay the rest. Last spring, Sen. Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican opposed to the Democratic-sponsored health care plan, requested a report by the Congressional Research Service -- the nonpartisan research arm of Congress -- that examined the Viagra question. CRS concluded that the law does "not appear to prohibit... coverage for drugs prescribed to treat [erectile dysfunction] for a non-incarcerated beneficiary who was previously convicted of rape, child molestation or another sex offense." Nor, the memo states, would those individuals "appear to be excluded from enrolling in a qualified health plan offered through an American Health Benefit Exchange in their state solely because of that conviction." The number of people potentially affected isn't trivial. According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, about 704,700 sex offenders are registered in the United States, including the District of Columbia and U.S. territories. Coburn offered an amendment to the health care bill that would "reduce the cost of providing federally funded prescription drugs by eliminating fraudulent payments and prohibiting coverage of Viagra for child molesters and rapists and for drugs intended to induce abortion." By the time the Senate took up the amendment on March 24, 2010, the margin for passing the bill was extremely narrow, and the bill's sponsors knew that any changes, no matter how small, could effectively kill the bill. So they fought Coburn's amendment for procedural reasons, hoping to save the bill as a whole and knowing that they would almost certainly be called to account for their "no" vote during the 2010 campaign. Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., encouraged his colleagues to reject the amendment, arguing, "This is a serious bill. This is a serious debate. The amendment offered by the senator from Oklahoma makes a mockery of the Senate, the debate and the American people... It is a crass political stunt aimed at making 30-second commercials, not public policy." Ultimately, the amendment failed, 57-42, with Reid among those voting against it. The health care law eventually was signed into law, and Baucus was quite right that it would show up in 30-second commercials. So how accurate is Angle's charge? The ad implies that Reid actively wanted to give subsidized Viagra to sex offenders, but that isn't the case. First, what Reid actually did was vote against an amendment that would have stopped using taxpayer dollars for that purpose. Second, Senate Democrats made it clear at the time that they were not voting on the merits of the amendment, but rather to salvage their bigger legislative priority, the health care bill itself. Finally, Reid didn't actively bring up this issue; it was proposed by a senator opposed to the broader health care bill. We should also mention that the use of taxpayer dollars for sex-offender Viagra was -- and is -- a hypothetical. While CRS concluded that there was nothing in the current law to stop it from happening, the earliest it could start is in 2014 -- so there's ample time for lawmakers or federal officials to write laws or regulations to stop it before then. Finally, whatever taxpayer subsidies for sex offenders may materialize after 2014 would not go to all sex offenders; it would go to the subset of sex offenders who get their health care through the exchanges and who also qualify for subsidies. The ad is correct that Reid voted against a prohibition on taxpayer-subsidized Viagra for sex offenders. But the ad leaves out a lot of important context that, if it had been included, would have given a different impression. We rate the ad Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11789	"The average cost for infant care in GA is almost $7,700/yr – more than average in-state college tuition."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2017/nov/22/stacey-abrams/claim-georgia-child-care-picks-its-numbers-make-ca/	While announcing her child care plan, Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams claimed that the average cost of childcare in Georgia is more than the average in-state tuition. The claim first appeared on Nov.15 in a Tweet promoting "The Bold Action for a Bright Future Plan". "The average cost for infant care in GA is almost $7,700/yr – more than average in-state college tuition," read the post. The Abrams campaign pulled this information from the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank that researches economic trends. The EPI's data says that in Georgia, infant care costs an average of $7,644 a year, 15.6 percent more than the state’s annual average in-state tuition. The EPI’s estimated infant costs come from Child Care Aware of America’s 2015 "Parents and the High Cost of Child Care" report. The report calculates the averages of two types of infant care, care offered at a facility and care offered at someone’s home.The $7,644 used by the EPI is the more expensive type of infant care, care offered at a facility. According to the report, the average cost of childcare provided in a caregiver’s home in Georgia is $5,980 a year. According to EPI, Georgia's average in-state tuition estimate was taken from a 2014 survey conducted by the National Center of Education Statistics, a division of the U.S. Education Department. The total cost of tuition and required fees in a public university in Georgia averages out to $6,614 a year. So Abrams' number is accurate if the comparison is between child care at a facility and in-state college tuition. But it’s not correct if the comparison is with child care provided in a home. Abrams is not the first, and possibly not the last politician to make this type of comparison. Back in 2014, PolitiFact checked President Barack Obama's claim that in 31 states "decent" childcare cost more than college tuition. Back then, Obama also used Child Care Aware of America as a source. We rated his claim as Mostly True. Our ruling Abrams tweeted, "The average cost for infant care in GA is almost $7,700/yr – more than average in-state college tuition."

pomt-02588	During the past four years, "average wages have barely budged."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/28/barack-obama/state-union-obama-says-over-past-four-years-averag/	One of the key themes of President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address was income inequality. "Today, after four years of economic growth, corporate profits and stock prices have rarely been higher, and those at the top have never done better," Obama said. "But average wages have barely budged. Inequality has deepened. Upward mobility has stalled. The cold, hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery, too many Americans are working more than ever just to get by - let alone get ahead. And too many still aren't working at all." Here, we will check Obama’s claim that during the past four years, "average wages have barely budged." At PolitiFact, one of our core principles is "words matter." So in this item, we will look at average wages -- not the median wage, and not the average (or median) family income or household income. We found two federal data sets that look at the average wage. • The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates These statistics are based on data collected from employers in all industry sectors and in all types of regions nationwide. The most recent year available is 2012. Year Mean annual wage, all occupations Inflation-adjusted mean annual wage in 2012 dollars 2008 $42,270 $45,076 2009 $43,460 $46,510 2010 $44,410 $46,760 2011 $45,230 $46,166 2012 $45,790 $45,790 So according to this data set, the average annual wage increased by 8.3 percent between 2008 and 2012. (We also looked at the changes between 2009 and 2012, since either date range seems a plausible "four-year" period to us, and the numbers were similar..) However, this raw wage data doesn’t take into account inflation -- something economists like to consider when determining whether a wage "barely budged." When you use an inflation calculator, the average wage from 2008 was equivalent to $45,075 in 2012 dollars, meaning that the inflation-adjusted wage rose during that period, but only narrowly -- about 1.6 percent. By this data, Obama is correct. • The Social Security Administration's National Average Wage Index These are the numbers used to calculate Social Security recipients’ benefit levels. Here’s the breakdown: Year National average wage In 2012 dollars 2008 $41,335 $44,079 2009 $40,712 $43,569 2010 $41,674 $43,879 2011 $42,980 $43,869 2012 $44,322 $44,322 According to this data set, the average annual wage increased by 7.2 percent between 2008 and 2012. After you adjust for inflation, the average wage from 2008 was $44,079 in 2012 dollars. So from 2008-12, the inflation-adjusted wage rose by less than 1 percent. Whichever data you use, the increases are pretty modest, particularly given that they were spread out over a four-year period. Our ruling Obama said that during the past four years, "average wages have barely budged." Two federal data sets broadly agree: Over the most recent four-year period, the average wage has risen no more than 1.7 percent above inflation. That’s a rising wage -- but by a small amount, about a half a percentage point above inflation per year. We think that’s a reasonable definition for "barely budged." So we rate Obama’s claim True.

pomt-09557	Health care reform "would bring down the deficit by as much as $1 trillion over the next two decades."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/01/barack-obama/health-care-reform-estimates-deficit-reduction-are/	President Barack Obama continued to promote Democratic proposals to reform health care during his State of the Union address. He rebutted charges that it costs too much and pointed out that budget experts believe it could reduce the deficit. "It would reduce costs and premiums for millions of families and businesses," Obama said. "And according to the Congressional Budget Office -– the independent organization that both parties have cited as the official scorekeeper for Congress –- our approach would bring down the deficit by as much as $1 trillion over the next two decades." Obama is correct that the Congressional Budget Office, with its teams of economists and legislative analysts, has found that the Senate Democratic health care plan not only pays for itself but brings down the deficit. That's because the plan includes new tax provisions and cost-savings measures to pay for its spending. The CBO found the Senate Democrats' version of health care reform would reduce the deficit by $132 billion over 10 years. The deficit is expected to go down because tax increases and cost savings in the bill are expected to exceed the cost of the new programs and tax credits. So how does Obama get to $1 trillion over 20 years? The CBO usually only calculates the impact of legislation's cost over 10 years. But it will create calculations for a longer period if Congress requests it. The CBO doesn't like to calculate longer than 10 years because many variables are difficult to predict. Here's what the CBO had to say about calculating health reform's effect on the deficit between 2020 and 2030: "Although CBO does not generally provide cost estimates beyond the 10-year budget projection period (2010 through 2019 currently), Senate rules require some information about the budgetary impact of legislation in subsequent decades, and many Members have requested CBO analyses of the long-term budgetary impact of broad changes in the nation’s health care and health insurance systems. A detailed year-by-year projection for years beyond 2019, like those that CBO prepares for the 10-year budget window, would not be meaningful because the uncertainties involved are simply too great. Among other factors, a wide range of changes could occur — in people’s health, in the sources and extent of their insurance coverage, and in the delivery of medical care (such as advances in medical research, technological developments, and changes in physicians’ practice patterns) — that are likely to be significant but are very difficult to predict, both under current law and under any proposal." In fact, the CBO won't even present its findings as a straightforward dollar number, but instead as a percentage of the gross domestic product, or GDP, which is a number that measures a nation's economic output. The CBO said that over the second 10 years, the Senate proposal should reduce the deficit by about one-quarter to one-half percent of GDP. Obama's $1 trillion figure is an extrapolation of what one-fourth to one-half of 1 percent of GDP might be. (The White House press office confirmed that this was how he arrived at that number.) According to the CBO's latest numbers, GDP will be $22.5 trillion in 2020. You can do a rough estimate and find that you could get to roughly $1 trillion over 20 years, especially if you lean closer to one-half of 1 percent rather than a quarter. We ran all this by Brian Riedl, lead budget analyst at the conservative Heritage Institution. He said that the numbers aren't phony, but that Obama tries to put a hard number on something that is inherently unpredictable. "You really can't model GDP 15 years from now," he said. Riedl also said he thought Congress would not be able to stick to some of the spending reductions contained in the Democratic proposals, especially in regards to Medicare. We also asked Jim Horney, director of federal fiscal policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, what he thought of the formulation. Horney said the CBO officials don't give a precise number because they don't have official estimates for the overall economy, called a baseline, for the second 10 years. "They correctly hesitate to put in precise numbers that might make people think they do have a 20-year baseline," he said. As for Obama's $1 trillion number, Horney said, "It's a little speculative, but if you say in your speech it will reduce the deficit one-quarter to one-half percent of GDP, no one listening to the State of the Union would have a clue as to what you meant, and it would make it sound like a tiny amount when it's not." So Obama is relying on some very shaky estimates here. He would have been on firmer ground if he had simply said that during the second 20 years, the CBO found that health care would continue to improve the deficit. He gave himself some leeway was by saying it could be "as much as" $1 trillion, but that's an estimate that the CBO itself didn't produce. In fact, the CBO said the uncertainties involved are too great to create detailed projections. For putting a firm number on the CBO's carefully hedged projection, we rate his statement Half True.

pomt-13332	Says GOP Congressional candidate Scott Jones "wants to build a wall. He wants to round people up and deport folks."	half-true	/california/statements/2016/oct/05/ami-bera/does-calif-republican-scott-jones-want-build-wall-/	Democratic Congressman Ami Bera has repeatedly described his Republican challenger’s immigration stance as "extreme," saying it compares with Donald Trump’s. Bera tried to draw that connection again during a recent interview with Capital Public Radio, in which he said Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones "wants to build a wall" and "wants to round people up and deport folks." Bera and Jones are in a tight race for suburban Sacramento County’s 7th Congressional District. Here’s Bera’s recent statement in context: "I mean this is a guy Scott Jones who’s extreme, extreme on immigration. You know he wants to build a wall. He wants to round people up and deport folks and yeah I’m worried that Scott Jones and Donald Trump are right there in tandem on immigration and I disagree with that approach." In May, Jones said he planned to vote for Trump for president. Three months later, he said he did not know who he would vote for. Bera is backing Hillary Clinton. We decided to fact check whether Jones "wants to build a wall," and whether he "wants to round people up and deport folks." Our research Asked to back up the "build a wall" assertion, the Bera campaign pointed to a widely-viewed November 2014 video in which Jones calls on President Obama to reform immigration. Jones made the video weeks after Sacramento County Sheriff’s Deputy Danny Oliver was killed during a shooting rampage by an undocumented immigrant who had been deported twice. At the end, Jones says: "An American patriot, Ronald Reagan, once told Russian President Mikhail Gorbachev to ‘tear down this wall,’ to preserve democracy and secure safety and freedom for a nation. Mr. President, I’m asking you to build up that wall for the very same reasons." Scott Jones makes the "build up that wall" comment at the 7:00 minute mark in the video above. Jack Pitney, professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College and former Republican National Committee staffer, said "it’s a stretch" to say Jones was advocating for the same massive wall along the Southern border that Trump has since called for. "It’s an exaggeration of what (Jones) has said in the past," Pitney said, adding it’s not exactly clear what Jones meant by "build up that wall." In the "Immigration Reform Plan" released by the Jones campaign last month, Jones called for a "combination of beefed-up border patrols, increased fencing and technology, and certain consequences for illegal entry will help us keep America safe," to secure the border. A spokesman for the Jones campaign said in a statement: "Sheriff Scott Jones has never advocated for building a wall on the entirety of the Southern Border." "Round people up and deport folks" To back up its claim that Jones wants to "round people up and deport folks," the Bera campaign pointed to Jones’ support for the federal Davis-Oliver bill. That legislation, according to a Washington Post article, would authorize state and local governments to enforce federal immigration law and direct money to help in that effort. It would also punish localities that have created "sanctuary cities," where illegal immigrants need not fear being arrested for their immigration status. It is named after the Sacramento County deputy killed in 2014, and Placer County Detective Michael Davis, Jr., who was also killed in the rampage. Trump specifically mentioned and supported that bill during his immigration policy speech in August. The Bera campaign says the bill would "amount to a strategy for comprehensive mass deportation." Pitney said linking Jones to the federal bill shows the Bera campaign has "at least a smidgen of documentation" to back up part of its claim. The professor noted, however, that deportations are common under Republican and Democratic administrations alike. Jones has not called "for the mass deportation of those in our country illegally," his campaign said. In his reform plan, Jones says: "All immigrants currently living here illegally should be given a pathway to legal status, provided they register and pass criminal background checks. Working immigrants should be allowed to stay and support their families, pay taxes, and live out of the shadows." When the Sacramento Bee asked Jones in January about his immigration stance, he responded: "No. 1, you are not going to deport 11 million people. I wouldn’t even advise you do that because by and large they are productive members of our community. They deserve more than what we are giving them despite the fact that they are here illegally. I would advocate for a pathway to legal status for each and every one of them." In the 2014 video, Jones also said he was open to a pathway to citizenship for the nation’s undocumented immigrants. Our ruling Congressman Ami Bera said his Republican challenger Scott Jones "wants to build a wall. He wants to round people up and deport folks." There’s some truth to that: In a 2014 video, Jones calls on President Obama to reform immigration and to "build up that wall," to "preserve democracy and secure safety and freedom for a nation." The statement hints at Jones’ possible preference for border security. But his official immigration reform plan released last month calls for "increased fencing and technology," and doesn’t mention the word "wall." Bera’s next claim that Jones wants to deport people might be technically correct: Jones has called for deporting undocumented immigrants "who have committed serious crimes." Bera’s overall statement is partially accurate. But it makes too broad a connection between Jones and Trump, who’s called for deporting millions of undocumented immigrants, not just those who have committed major crimes while in the United States. Bera ignores this key context. We rate his claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-13876	Proposed NC law for body camera footage gives police "broad authority to keep video footage secret – even from individuals who are filmed."	true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/jul/01/aclu-north-carolina/aclu-north-carolina-police-will-have-significant-p/	A bill that passed the N.C. General Assembly on Wednesday will create statewide rules for police body camera and dash camera footage, if Gov. Pat McCrory signs it into law. UPDATE 7/11/16: McCrory signed the bill into law. The bill’s main sponsors – two Republican members of the N.C. House who are retired law enforcement officers – have said it strikes a balance between the interests of police and the public. But open-government advocates including the state American Civil Liberties Union chapter say the opposite – that this bill would give police inordinate power to keep footage shielded from the public. "Giving law enforcement such broad authority to keep video footage secret – even from individuals who are filmed – will damage law enforcement’s ability to build trust with the public and destroy any potential this technology had to make officers more accountable to the communities they serve," said ACLU attorney Susanna Birdsong in a news release. We can’t see the future, so we won’t try to say whether keeping video footage secret will damage law enforcement’s public image and accountability. But we can look at just how easily footage could be kept secret if the bill becomes law. Two levels of publicity The bill would establish two ways for members of the public to view police video – disclosure and release. 1. Disclosure: When people are allowed to watch the video but can’t make copies of it or otherwise show it to the general public. Disclosure would only be available to people who are seen or heard in their video (or people who represent them, like lawyers or guardians). And even then it’s not guaranteed. Like the ACLU said, police can still decide the video requires so much secrecy that even people in the video can’t see it. 2. Release: The more typical meaning of something being made public. It’s an option for anyone who believes the video footage should be available for the public to see at any time. That includes reporters who wish to show the footage the the public as well as people who want copies of the footage to use as evidence in lawsuits, for example. Under the proposed law, release would only be possible if a judge signs off on the request. The status quo For any type of police video footage right now, there’s no explicit statewide standard. What’s considered public varies from agency to agency, according to Frayda Bluestein, a UNC-Chapel Hill law and government professor. One of the bill’s cosponsors, Asheboro Republican Allen McNeill, argued that the bill will improve transparency since many agencies now make these videos personnel records, which are hard for the public to access. Bluestein has studied the issue for years. She said most videos are considered investigative records, although some are classified as personnel records. In either case, she said, it’s still possible for the public to successfully open up those records simply by asking the agency. And if that fails, the courts are there to decide who is right. But the proposed law would make a trip to court the only option, even for the most innocuous footage. Who gains from transparency? Nationwide, police footage of officers shooting, choking and beating people have given rise to civil lawsuits, criminal charges and movements like Black Lives Matter. The Raleigh News & Observer recently used jailhouse video obtained by a public records request in Harnett County to show the official account of an inmate’s death differed from what actually happened. Other times, the police themselves have released videos in order to defend their officers’ actions. It’s rare in North Carolina, but not unheard of. Greensboro officials released body cam video last month of an officer shooting and killing a woman in 2014. Last year Lincolnton police released body cam footage leading up to an officer shooting a dog. In 2009 Chatham County officials released portions of dash cam video of a car chase that led to a fatal shooting. Who watches the watchmen? Birdsong said police will have "broad authority" to deny people the right to see video, including video of themselves. For disclosure requests the bill gives six provisions, saying officials "may consider any of the following factors in determining if a recording is disclosed." Those give police a wide range of options for denial: if the video contains otherwise confidential information, if it’s deemed "sensitive" or revealing, if it might harm someone’s reputation, if it might harm someone’s safety, or if it’s related to an active, inactive or potential criminal or internal investigation. "The 'may consider' portion of that is the part that is the most concerning to me," Birdsong said. If denied, people can appeal to a judge. But the law will force the judge to give latitude to the police’s original decision – the judge can only overrule police if he finds an "abuse of discretion." Getting the record made public All that was just to be able to watch the video one time, without being able to make a copy or show other people. What about people who want to make it fully public? That decision would be entirely up to a judge. But one public records attorney we spoke with, Mike Tadych, said it could be difficult to argue to a judge that video should be released if no member of the public has been able to see the video. That’s because the law would also require judges to only release the parts of the video specifically described in court. "I don’t know how in the world, without knowing what's on it, you would be able to say you know what's on it," Tadych said. Furthermore, anytime a judge is deciding whether to make footage public, the law would require that the local district attorney, the head of the agency that took the video and any officer whose image or voice is on the video must be notified and given a chance to testify. There are no such rights for the private citizens whose image or voice is in the footage. Our ruling The ACLU said if the bill becomes law, police will have "broad authority to keep video footage secret – even from individuals who are filmed." Police can stop individuals who were filmed by police from viewing the video, using broad and sometimes vague reasoning. And even on appeal, judges have limited authority to overrule the police. Police won't be able to decide if a video is made completely open to the public. Only a judge will. But in any given case, a number of law enforcement officials will have rights of notification and testimony that aren’t given to the regular individuals who are also in the video. We rate this claim True. After The Fact Gov. Pat McCrory signed the body cam bill into law on Monday, July 11. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/236400b3-7fa7-47c7-b200-7ff1e8dd16ab	None	ACLU of North Carolina	None	None	None	2016-07-01T16:55:06	2016-06-29	['None']
pomt-01827	Amid the "crisis at our southern border," there are "reports of illegal migrants carrying deadly diseases such as … Ebola virus."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/18/phil-gingrey/rep-phil-gingrey-says-migrants-may-be-bringing-ebo/	As a surge of unaccompanied children from Central America was arriving on the United States’ southern border this month, Rep. Phil Gingrey, R-Ga., expressed concern about the impact they could have on public health. On July 7, 2014, Gingrey wrote a letter expressing these concerns to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Here are excerpts: "As you know, the United States is currently experiencing a crisis at our southern border. The influx of families and unaccompanied children at the border poses many risks, including grave public health threats. "As a physician for over 30 years, I am well aware of the dangers infectious diseases pose. In fact, infectious diseases remain in the top 10 causes of death in the United States. … Reports of illegal migrants carrying deadly diseases such as swine flu, dengue fever, Ebola virus and tuberculosis are particularly concerning." Health experts agree that when large numbers of people from countries with spotty health care systems make an arduous trek and then get corralled into crowded holding facilities, it can pose a health risk. But the introduction of Ebola, the feared viral disease of African origin that kills up to 90 percent of victims through organ failures and leaking blood and fluids? That would be terrifying. So is it true that amid the "crisis at our southern border" there are "reports of illegal migrants carrying deadly diseases such as … Ebola virus" into the United States? After Gingrey’s letter became widely known, some commentators expressed disbelief that he had invoked Ebola, given that the disease is endemic to Africa, not Central America. On his July 17 show, Stephen Colbert mocked Gingrey, saying, "That virus has never appeared outside of Africa, but Gingrey may have caught it from an illegal already, because I believe one of the symptoms is baseless fear leaking out of your ass." When we checked with Gingrey’s office, however, spokesman Cameron Harley pointed us to a comment Gingrey made to NBC News’ Luke Russert that suggested he’s standing by the concerns he stated in the CDC letter. "The border patrol gave us a list of the diseases that they’re concerned about, and Ebola was one of those," Gingrey told Russert. "I can’t tell you specifically that there were any cases of Ebola, I don’t think there were, but of course tuberculosis, Chagas disease, many – smallpox, some of the infectious diseases of children, all of these are concerns." So is there anything to the Ebola claim? Experts we asked issued a resounding "No." First, we checked with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whose job includes tracking outbreaks of serious infectious diseases. Spokesman Daniel J. DeNoon confirmed that the CDC has received no reports of a human Ebola infection anywhere in the Western Hemisphere, much less the U.S.-Mexico border. "Ebola cases in humans have never been reported outside of Africa," DeNoon said. William Schaffner, an infectious-disease specialist at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, agreed. "The congressman is misinformed," he said. "There is no Ebola in the Western Hemisphere." We also checked whether it was plausible for a child or adult entering the United States from Central America via Mexico to be infected with the Ebola virus. CDC scientists call it "extremely unlikely," DeNoon said. Independent experts agreed. "It’s very, very, highly unlikely if you are talking about someone from Central America who has not traveled to Africa," Thomas W. Geisbert, a microbiologist and immunologist specializing in Ebola at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Geisbert said there have been examples of travelers carrying similar exotic diseases by airplane to the United States -- for instance, a passenger infected with Marburg virus who arrived in Colorado a few years ago, and another who came to Minnesota infected with Lassa virus earlier this year. And it’s worth noting that there’s currently a major Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Through July 12, there were 964 Ebola virus cases in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, including 603 deaths, according to CNN. However, the profile of the jet-flying Ebola carrier doesn’t mesh with the types of people now flocking to the U.S. border. "The incubation period is two to 21 days, so theoretically, an African could fly from an infected area, land in a Mexican airport, take a bus toward the border, hire a coyote to take him across and then ‘present’ with Ebola," said Thomas Fekete, section chief for infectious diseases at the Temple University School of Medicine. "But this presupposes a suicidal person who also has the resources for this kind of travel." Indeed, the prior, scattered examples of exotic and deadly diseases reaching the United States suggest that "the likelihood of an illegal migrant getting infected and introducing the disease to the U.S. is probably less than that of a ‘legal’ traveler," said Daniel G. Bausch, head of the virology and emerging infections department at the U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit No.6 in Lima, Peru. Another problem: If you had such an infection, the chances are good that you would die on the journey to the United States, said Arthur Caplan, director of the division of medical ethics at New York University’s Langone Medical Center. "You would be too sick to make it to the border by foot," he said. So where did these "reports of illegal migrants carrying deadly diseases such as ... Ebola virus" come from? Initially, when we asked for documentation, Gingrey’s office sent us a number of links to articles. Some discussed the one government-confirmed case of swine flu among recently arrived children, as well reports of scabies and lice and concerns that conditions in the centers holding newly arrived children could promote the spread of diseases such as tuberculosis. Here are the three links Gingrey’s office sent us that mentioned Ebola directly: • A post at a site called The Common Sense Show. It discusses the potential arrival of Ebola-infected migrants as part of a "coming series of pandemics" that "has some governmental agency fingerprints on this invasion. Smart money would say that the CIA is involved." • An outspokenly anti-President Barack Obama opinion piece in the American Thinker, a Web publication that, in turn, sources its Ebola information to an article on prisonplanet.com, a site run by Alex Jones, a broadcaster who describes himself as a "prominent figure of the 9/11 Truth Movement." Citing the continuing surge of migrants at the border, the article closes with this: "Obama is an enemy to the American people and seems determined to destroy us one way or another. The tyrant must be removed from office as soon as possible." • An article in WND, formerly known as WorldNetDaily, which has gained attention for publishing articles skeptical of President Obama having been born in Hawaii. The WND article, like the other two, didn’t offer hard documentation of Ebola being found in the United States -- only suggestions that it could. "Other diseases like dengue and Ebola virus also may be in this wave of illegals, since people are coming from Central and South America, the Middle East and West Africa," the WND article said. When we asked Harley, the spokesman for Gingrey, whether his office considered these three citations to be credible sources supporting the Ebola claim, he backtracked, saying, "These websites were not our source. The source was communication with border agents and organizations that we work with on immigration regularly." When we asked for further detail, we did not hear back, so we cannot vet these sources’ credibility. Our ruling Gingrey said that amid the "crisis at our southern border," there are "reports of illegal migrants carrying deadly diseases such as … Ebola virus." We don’t dispute that the conditions for newly arrived migrant children pose public health challenges. But Gingrey went well beyond that when he invoked Ebola, a particularly scary and untreatable disease with high mortality rates. The reality is that Ebola has only been found in Africa -- and experts agree that, given how the disease develops, the likelihood of children from Central America bringing it to the U.S. border is almost nonexistent. But most importantly for our fact-check, Gingrey’s office was unable to point to solid evidence that that Ebola has arrived in Western Hemisphere, much less the U.S. border. To the contrary, the CDC and independent epidemiologists say there is zero evidence that these migrants are carrying the virus to the border. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-03099	"The American people support defunding Obamacare and oppose shutting down the government."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/sep/23/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-favors-defunding-obamacare-opposes-gov/	Sen. Marco Rubio is among the big names in the Republican Party salivating at the chance to defund Obamacare. But Florida’s Republican senator says there’s no need to shut down the federal government over it, and conveniently enough, he says the American public agrees with him on both fronts. After the U.S. House of Representatives passed a short-term continuing resolution to defund Obamacare and keep the federal government open, Rubio issued a press release on Sept. 20, 2013: "The American people support defunding Obamacare and oppose shutting down the government. The House voted today to follow the will of the American people and the Senate should now follow suit." We decided to examine recent poll results to determine if Rubio correctly characterized the public’s view on Obamacare and a government shutdown. Polls about Obamacare The Kaiser Family Foundation, a healthy policy think tank, has repeatedly asked respondents since 2011 if they approve or disapprove of cutting off funding for the health care law, formally called the Affordable Care Act. The most recent poll, in mid August 2013, showed that 57 percent disapproved of cutting funding, while 36 percent approved. Those numbers have changed little since 2011. A few days after Rubio made his claim, CNBC released a summary of a poll that found Americans oppose defunding Obamacare by a plurality of 44 percent to 38 percent. (Due to the timing, we will not take this poll into account for rating Rubio’s claim, but we’re mentioning it since it is on point.) CNBC’s pollsters noted that people particularly oppose defunding Obamacare if it would lead to a government shutdown or other dramatic outcomes. "Opposition to defunding increases sharply when the issue of shutting down the government and defaulting is included. In that case, Americans oppose defunding 59 percent to 19 percent, with 18 percent of respondents unsure. The final 4 percent is a group of people who want to defund Obamacare, but become unsure when asked if they still hold that view if it means shutting down the government," stated the report. So where might Rubio get the idea that the majority of Americans support defunding Obamacare? We contacted spokespersons for Rubio for a response and didn’t hear back. But we did find an August poll released by the conservative group Heritage Action, the lobbying arm of the Heritage Foundation, which showed that 57 percent support defunding Obamacare. The poll done by Basswood Research also found that about 68 percent support temporarily halting funding to make sure the provisions "do not do more harm than good." The poll was conducted in 10 House districts -- six currently held by Republicans. But the Heritage poll was widely criticized as a push poll, including by the Washington Post’s conservative blogger Jennifer Rubin, who called it "Heritage’s Junk Poll." Still, many recent polls show either a majority or plurality of Americans are critical of Obamacare depending on how the question is asked. How is it that these people don’t also want to see it defunded? For an answer we turned to Robert Blendon, professor of health policy and political analysis at Harvard University. Not surprisingly, the answer is in the wording. When respondents are asked if they favor "defunding" Obamacare, they oppose that, Blendon said. But when respondents are asked if they support repealing the law, they support some type of repeal. For example, a July 2013 CBS poll found 39 percent support repealing the entire law and 18 percent support repealing the mandate. While Americans think the law spends too much money, they don’t want to cut it back to zero funding. The individual mandate is probably the most unpopular part of the bill, Blendon said. However, "defunding doesn’t sound like a way to get rid of the individual mandate -- it sounds like you’re taking money away from sick people." If President Barack Obama wants to keep the bill as is and Republicans want to repeal it, Blendon said, then the public "is in the middle, which is to keep some and get rid of some. ... Neither party is giving them exactly what it is they want." Polls about government shutdown As for a government shutdown, the polls we found -- whether by an impartial media outlet or the right or the left -- showed the majority of Americans opposed. A CNN/ORC poll conducted Sept. 6-8 found that if the federal government had to shut down for a few days, 38 percent said it would cause "major problems," and 11 percent said it would cause a "crisis." When asked about a shutdown lasting for a few weeks, about three-fourths said it would cause major problems or a crisis. A poll done for Republican members of Congress found a significant majority oppose a government shutdown. A poll done for the conservative Crossroads GPS found that despite opposition to Obamacare, voters say it’s a bad idea to risk shutting down the government. "Only tea party backers embrace the idea, while independents reject it two-to-one," stated the Crossroads GPS poll. A poll for the liberal Huffington Post found a majority believe a shutdown would hurt the economy. Finally, we found one poll, a Washington Post/ABC News poll from Sept. 12-15, that came close to combining the moves of defunding Obamacare and a government shutdown, but it didn’t actually use the phrase "government shutdown." Instead, it asked if people favored or opposed the health care law (not defunding it) and then asked those who opposed the law if they favored "shutting down major activities of the federal government." According to the Post, the poll found that "only about one-quarter of Americans (27 percent) want Congress to shut down the government rather than pass a budget that funds Obamacare -- a threat that is inherent in some GOP lawmakers' pledges not to support any such budget. (Another 20 percent oppose Obamacare but don't want to risk a shutdown, while 5 percent oppose the law but aren't sure what they want to come from budget negotiations.)" Our ruling Rubio said, "The American people support defunding Obamacare and oppose shutting down the government." Rubio makes it sound like he has support from the public for his main objective, which is defunding Obamacare. He doesn’t. When asking the public about Obamacare, word choice matters, and "defund" leads to a different result than "repeal." While the law isn’t popular, a recent Kaiser poll found 57 percent opposed cutting off funding. On his second point, he’s right that most people tell pollsters they don’t want a government shutdown. But we’ll point out that both sides in the budget battle in Congress say they don’t want a shutdown. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-01950	Mark Warner’s "record is one of acting against" the Keystone XL pipeline.	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2014/jun/23/ed-gillespie/ed-gillespie-says-mark-warners-record-against-keys/	Republican Senate candidate Ed Gillespie says Democratic incumbent Mark Warner voices support for the Keystone XL pipeline but works against it. The crude oil pipeline would extend 1,179 miles from the Alberta oil sands in Canada to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with existing pipelines that run to Gulf Coast refineries. The privately-built line could carry 830,000 barrels of oil a day. Environmentalists say Keystone would contribute to global warming. Supporters say it would create jobs and reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil. Because the pipeline crosses a U.S. border, it must be approved by the U.S. State Department. The department began its review in 2008 and, three years later, determined there would be no significant environmental damage and asked other federal agencies to weigh in. But this April, the department indefinitely delayed its approval until after a challenge to the pipelines route in Nebraska is settled by that state’s courts. In the Senate, pipeline supporters have tried several times during the past two years to pressure the Obama administration to approve the project. After an effort last month was bogged by partisan infighting, Gillespie blasted an email and news release saying of Warner, "He likes to tell us he supports Keystone Pipeline, but his record is one of acting against it." We wondered whether Warner, who for years has said he backs Keystone, really does have a record to the contrary. Paul Logan, spokesman for Gillespie’s campaign, said the statement was based on Keystone votes Warner cast in 2012 and this May. Let’s take a look: The 2012 vote Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., on March 8 tried to attach to a highway funding bill an amendment saying that the State Department’s environmental sign-off on the pipeline the previous year satisfied all federal permitting and authorizations needed to start Keystone. The measure, which required 60 votes to proceed, failed 56-42 with Warner voting against it. Warner said then that although he supported Keystone, he thought it should be used as leverage to gain support for a comprehensive energy bill that would include tax incentives for the production of alternative energy. He said, "...I will not be voting for the Keystone amendment today because, by making this a straight up-or-down issue without taking advantage of the opportunity to put together the beginnings of an energy package, we’re missing a great opportunity." The 2014 vote On May 12, a Senate deadlock on a bipartisan energy conservation bill appeared to end any chance the the chamber would consider the pipeline before this November’s elections. The legislation -- sponsored by Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H. and Rob Portman, R-Ohio -- would have provided tax incentives for fuel efficiency in commercial buildings, houses and appliances. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., favored the measure but was concerned that senators facing reelection this year would weigh down the bill with amendments for Keystone and other controversial energy policies. So Reid, who opposes the pipeline, made a promise: If the Senate approved the Shaheen-Portman bill without allowing any amendments, he would permit a vote on legislation mandating that the White House move past its environmental reviews of Keystone and order it approved. Republicans, however, offered a series of amendments to the bill that included Keystone and a provision that would prevent the White House from moving forward on new regulations for coal-fired plants. Their efforts were cut off by Reid. Warner joined most Democrats in voting to end debate and allow the unadulterated energy efficiency bill to come up for consideration. But that motion was opposed by Republicans and fell five votes short of the 60 the bill needed to proceed. GOP leaders said the best hope for advancing Keystone was to stitch it into a bill with other energy measures. Democrats dismissed that reasoning, saying President Barack Obama was bound to veto legislation that would have prevented new regulations on carbon emissions -- as Republicans wanted. Gillespie adopts the GOP line and says that Warner, in voting to cut off debate without amendments, voted against the pipeline. "Reid's purpose in decoupling a Keystone vote from the energy efficiency bill was intended precisely to ensure that it failed," said Logan, the campaign’s spokesman. Logan’s comments point to an additional chapter in this story that Gillespie does not publicize: The decoupled Keystone bill that would have come up for vote had the Senate approved energy efficiency bill according to Reid’s demands. Warner was among 55 cosponsors of the bipartisan bill to advance the pipeline. Other Keystone activities Warner’s campaign sent us list of actions and votes the senator has made in favor of the pipeline: This April, Warner was among 11 Democrats who signed a letter asking Obama to approve Keystone by May 31. Warner was among 53 senators from both parties who signed a letter to Obama in January 2013 urging approval of the pipeline after Nebraska chose a route through the state. A month later, he was 18 senators who sent a similar letter to Secretary of State John Kerry. In March 2013, Warner voted for an amendment to a Senate budget resolution that supported Keystone construction. The amendment required no binding action to spur Keystone, but was was considered an indication of the Senate’s support for the pipeline. Virginia’s other senator, Democrat Tim Kaine, opposed the amendment. Warner has taken heat from environmentalists for his Keystone actions. Blue Virginia, a pro-Democratic blog, in January 2013 listed Warner among 53 "sell-outs to big oil" in the Senate. Protesters have picketed him and his office in Harrisonburg and Richmond. The League of Conservation Voters gave Mark Warner an 85 percent rating on its scorecard in 2013, a downgrade, partly due to his support of the non-binding Keystone resolution. Glen Besa, director of the Sierra Club’s Virginia chapter, told us he considers Warner a solid pipeline supporter. "He’s not only said he supports the Keystone Pipeline, he’s voted for it, much to our chagrin," Besa said. Our ruling Gillespie says Warner’s "record is one of acting against" the Keystone XL pipeline. In 2012, Warner did oppose a procedural step that would have allowed a Senate vote on expediting the project. He explained that he even though supported the pipeline, he thought it should be part of a broad energy policy. Even so, its reasonable to count this vote as an action against Keystone. But after that, Gillespie’s claim runs into problems. Each party blames the other for the Senate’s failure to pass pro-Keystone legislation this May. Gillespie’s campaign notes that Warner helped block a GOP effort to amend an energy efficiency bill with a go-ahead for Keystone and a provision that would prevented new carbon emission regulations. On the other hand, Warner co-sponsored a clean bill that would have expedited the pipeline. A review of the record shows Warner voted in favor of a Keystone resolution in 2013. He signed two letters to the president and one to the secretary of state asking them to expedite the project. Many environmentalists put Warner squarely in the Keystone crowd. So we rate Gillespie’s statement Mostly False.	None	Ed Gillespie	None	None	None	2014-06-23T00:00:00	2014-05-14	['None']
pomt-02044	Says Hillary Clinton "defended Syria’s President Assad as a possible reformer at the start of that country’s civil war."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/01/chris-wallace/chris-wallace-hillary-clinton-defended-syrias-assa/	Talk along the lines of Hillary, Hillary, Hillary dominated the network news shows Sunday, as hosts and their guests mulled Hillary Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state, excerpts from her forthcoming memoir Hard Choices and her potential 2016 presidential bid. Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace countered praise of Clinton from Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., by listing some of Clinton’s troubles as President Barack Obama’s top diplomat. Wallace singled out developments in U.S. relations during Obama’s first term with Russia, Iran and Syria. "She defended Syria’s President Assad as a possible reformer at the start of that country’s civil war," he said. PunditFact wanted to dig into Wallace’s claim. Clinton’s remarks in early days of Syrian protests Clinton’s comments in question stretch back to the Arab Spring of 2011, when government revolts erupted in Middle Eastern countries such as Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen. Syria, too, spun into chaos with violent clashes between government forces of Assad, who assumed the presidency when his father died in 2000, and protesters. The starting point for what became a bloody civil war came in the remote city of Daraa, where 15 schoolchildren were arrested for spray-painting anti-government graffiti on their school with messages such as "the people want to topple the regime," according to CNN. The military used brutal force to address sit-ins in Damascus and Daraa over the treatment of the jailed protesters, which spurred thousands more Syrians to turn against Assad. Clinton talked about the developments Syria on CBS’ Face the Nation on March 27, 2011. Host Bob Schieffer pressed her on why the U.S. reaction would be different from its response to Libya with air strikes. Syria, Schieffer noted, is no friend of the U.S. as an enemy of Israel and ally of Iran, and Assad’s father had "killed 25,000 people, at a lick" in 1982. Clinton said: "Well, if there were a coalition of the international community, if there were the passage of a Security Council resolution, if there were a call by the Arab League, if there was a condemnation that was universal, but that is not going to happen because I don't think that it's yet clear what will occur, what will unfold. "There is a different leader in Syria now. Many of the members of Congress of both parties who have gone to Syria in recent months have said they believe he's a reformer. "What's been happening there the last few weeks is deeply concerning, but there's a difference between calling out aircraft and indiscriminately strafing and bombing your own cities than police actions which, frankly, have exceeded the use of force that any of us would want to see." So Clinton did refer to Assad as "a reformer." But she crafted the line as the opinion of "members of Congress of both parties," not her opinion. And she never defended (as Wallace said) Assad, instead saying in that interview that he "exceeded the use of force that any of us would want to see." Still, Clinton’s comments were widely reported and criticized. Clinton mentioned "both parties," but the Washington Post’s Fact Checker looked into Clinton’s statement and was unable to find public comments from Republicans along those lines. Two days later, Clinton addressed her comment at a press conference in London. She responded to a Wall Street Journal reporter’s question asking if it is her position that Assad is a reformer. "I referenced opinions of others," Clinton said. "That was not speaking either for myself or for the Administration." She said the administration deplored the Syrian crackdown on protesters and that it’s up to Syria’s leaders "to prove that it can be responsive to the needs of its own people." Clinton went on. "We’re troubled by what we hear, but we’re also going to continue to urge that the promise of reform, which has been made over and over again and which you reported on just a few months ago – ‘I’m a reformer, I’m going to reform, and I’ve talked to members of Congress and others about that,’ that we hear from the highest levels of leadership in Syria – will actually be turned into reality," she said. "That’s what we’re waiting and watching for." As the military crackdown on Syrians persisted and worsened, Obama and Clinton called on Assad to go. Clinton was interviewed in November 2011 for ABC News by Jake Tapper, who noted she "at one point seemed to have optimism that Assad was a reformer." Clinton said, "Well, we had hoped so because there was a lot at stake, we wanted to see an agreement, for example, between Syria and Israel. That was something that people have been working on for 30 years. We heard what Assad said about what he wanted to do for reform. But when it came to it, in the Arab Spring and as people actually demanded some freedom and their rights, he responded, as we have seen, very violently. "But he’s not going to be able to sustain what is a unfortunately growing armed opposition apparently fueled and maybe led by defectors from his army. It’s probably too late for him to change course, but there needs to be a change at the top of that government, and there needs to be an effort to engage in genuine dialogue and start on the path of reform." Reaction and context As we researched, we found that talk of the Syrian dictator being a reformer was a popular talking point when he took power. The enthusiasm for Assad began to dissipate with his opposition to President George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq and the assassination of Lebanese prime minister Rafiq Hariri, which Syrian security officials were faulted for but Assad denied. The Bush White House also said the government was allowing members of terrorist groups to pass through his country to fight the United States in Iraq. Then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, opposed to the Bush administration’s foreign policy, visited Assad in Syria in 2007. She said, "We came in friendship, hope, and determined that the road to Damascus is a road to peace." Then-U.S. Sen. John Kerry also had a hopeful view of Assad engaging the West, saying in a March 16, 2011, appearance as the first big anti-governments protests erupted in Syria that Assad "has been very generous with me" and fulfilled Kerry’s diplomatic requests. (Kerry changed his tune on Assad in a March 31, 2011, press release). Another person with "high hopes" that were dashed was Middle East historian and Trinity University professor David Lesch, author of The New Lion of Damascus: Bashar al-Assad and modern Syria in 2005 and Syria: The Fall of the House of Assad in 2012. Lesch interviewed Assad in Syria from 2004 to 2008, writing that he probably knows him better than anyone in the West. In the newest book, Lesch says he was initially impressed by the promise that London-educated Assad seemed to bring with his presidency compared with the 30-year repressive regime of his father, Hafez al-Assad. Instead of finally implementing political reforms with the uprising, Assad listened to his military and thought he could put it down, Lesch told us by email. "I think the Obama administration (and Secretary Clinton) were trying to give Assad some space in which to make the necessary reforms," Lesch told PunditFact. But Assad’s regime by then "had chosen and was committed to forcefully putting down the revolt." Our ruling Criticizing parts of Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state, Wallace said Clinton "defended Syria’s President Assad as a possible reformer at the start of that country’s civil war." Clinton’s original comments in March 2011 were not that straightforward. The statement in question was actually, "Many of the members of Congress of both parties who have gone to Syria in recent months have said they believe he's a reformer." Clinton was talking about the beliefs of Congress and didn’t "defend" Assad, as Wallace put it, instead saying that the use of force that he deployed was more "than any of us would want to see." Still, Clinton’s choice to talk about those members’ opinions of Assad without knocking them down suggests she may have found them credible and bolsters Wallace’s claim. Wallace’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details and takes things out of context. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-08774	"Roy Barnes is part of the team that has run up trillions of dollars in debt that Americans will spend years paying off, and they've done it without creating one job."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2010/aug/24/brian-robinson/barnes-part-team-blame-failed-policies-deal-spokes/	So who's responsible for the economic mess ensnaring Georgia and the rest of the nation? Democratic Party gubernatorial nominee Roy Barnes pointed his finger at his GOP challenger, Nathan Deal, and fellow Republicans during the Democrats' state convention on Aug. 14 in Athens. The Republicans have cut education funding and raised property taxes during their eight years in control of the Governor's Mansion, Barnes charged. "Nathan Deal is part of the team that brought Georgia to where we are now," said Barnes, a former governor. Brian Robinson, a spokesman for Deal, wasn't going to let that slide. "Roy Barnes is part of the team that has run up trillions of dollars in debt that Americans will spend years paying off, and they've done it without creating one job," Robinson told the Athens Banner-Herald. Robinson told PolitiFact Georgia he based his statement on the results of the stimulus package passed by the Democrat-led Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama in February 2009. AJC PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a look at Robinson's claim, since it was more specific than what Barnes said. Republicans have portrayed Barnes as a supporter of Obama and some of the policies supported by Democrats in Washington, figuring they won't play well with voters in conservative Georgia. In fact, in 2008 Barnes donated $2,300 to "Obama for America" and $2,500 to the "Obama Victory Fund," records show. More recently, Barnes avoided the president when he came to Atlanta this month. Barnes campaign manager Chris Carpenter said he wasn't invited to two events Obama held on his visit. A Democratic National Committee spokeswoman said Barnes was invited to an Obama fundraiser. PolitiFact Georgia gave Carpenter a "Pants on Fire" rating for claiming Barnes wasn't invited to any of the events. Robinson cited Barnes' campaign contributions to Obama's presidential bid as part of his rationale for connecting the two Democrats. "If Nathan is a part of [the team of Republicans], then Roy is part of the Democratic team that passed the stimulus bill, bailed out [General Motors] and passed ObamaCare," Robinson said. But do campaign contributions really make Barnes "a part of the [Obama] team"? University of Georgia political scientist Charles Bullock said it's common for state candidates to link opponents to the unpopular policies of their national party. Bullock said it's a "tenuous link" to connect Barnes, a former governor who's been out of office since 2003, to Obama administration policies -- or, for that matter, to link Deal, a former congressman, to the policies of Republican leaders at the state Capitol. "Barnes didn't vote for [those policies], he couldn't. He wasn't a member of Congress," Bullock said. "The only thing you can say [about Barnes and Obama] is there is a D on their jersey." So, what about Robinson's claim about the debt? The federal debt held by the public was nearly $5.8 trillion at the end of fiscal year 2008, which encompassed most of George W. Bush's last year as president, according to the White House Office of Management and Budget. In fiscal year 2009, OMB data shows the debt rose to $7.5 trillion. The federal fiscal year begins Oct. 1 and ends Sept. 30 of the next calendar year. Fiscal year 2010 ends Sept. 30, 2010. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the debt held by the public will rise to $10.5 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2011 under Obama's budget and nearly double by September 2020. Now, let's deal with Robinson's claim about jobs. "There are fewer jobs today than there were [when the stimulus passed]," Robinson said. "You can't say you created a job if 30 others were lost." Federal labor statistics data show the number of Georgians employed has dropped by about 200,000 people since the 2009 stimulus was adopted. Georgia's unemployment rate rose in that time from 8.7 percent to 10 percent. Nationally, the unemployment rate has risen since February 2009 from 8.1 percent to 9.5 percent. The data suggest Robinson is right about fewer jobs being created since the stimulus. But that's not what he said. Robinson said the stimulus hasn't created "one job." Federal officials credit the stimulus for creating or saving 24,103 jobs in Georgia during the last three months of 2009, the AJC reported in January. There are some issues with the numbers. It combines some part-time jobs into "full-time equivalent" jobs. Raises funded through the stimulus are counted toward the job numbers, the AJC reported in January. Federal officials initially reported jobs "created or saved" by the stimulus. They changed the terminology to "recovery funded jobs reported by recipients" in January after consulting recipients, good government groups and members of Congress. The federal government counts stimulus jobs as positions funded by the money, even if the person worked at the company beforehand. Several private-sector economic-analysis firms say the stimulus has saved or created more than 1 million jobs. U.S. Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass., made a similar claim during a February news conference that "the last stimulus bill didn't create one new job." Our friends on the national PolitiFact site asked Brown about that statement. A spokesman clarified the senator's statement to say the stimulus hasn't created "any new jobs." PolitiFact gave Brown a "Pants on Fire" rating for his initial statement. While Barnes did support Obama financially, he has not been a member of Congress and hasn't been a close adviser to the president. We agree with Bullock that it is tenuous to link Barnes to Obama's policies. As for the other aspects of the claim: Robinson is correct to say debt has risen since the stimulus, but we have trouble with the final portion of his quote to the Athens Banner-Herald. The way the federal government counts stimulus jobs has been problematic, but several independent groups say the stimulus has saved or created some jobs. It's a stretch, we believe, to say the stimulus has not created "one job." All in all, we rate Robinson's statement as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-07606	"Not even expensive bottled water, like Perrier and Evian, are of good enough quality to pump out of mines in Southwest Virginia, according to the EPA regulation."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2011/mar/22/morgan-griffith/morgan-griffith-says-epa-standards-are-so-strict-p/	What do French bottled water and Appalachian streams have in common? More than you might think, according to Rep. H. Morgan Griffith, R-9th. A vocal opponent of the Environmental Protection Agency, the southwest Virginia legislator pledged in February to roll back regulations governing water from mountain-top mining areas. "Not even expensive bottled water, like Perrier and Evian, are of good enough quality to pump out of mines in Southwest Virginia, according to the EPA regulation," Griffith wrote. Standards so strict that Perrier and Evian would fail? We couldn’t swallow that without checking. We had two questions: Would fancy bottled water really fail a conductivity test? And would that sort of test actually tell us anything about the safety of the bottled water? First, a word about EPA the standards and how mountain-top mining works. This form of mining relies on explosives to expose coal seams in far southwest Virginia and West Virginia. The controlled explosions generate huge piles of debris that often bury nearby valleys. In April 2010 the EPA said "the resulting waste that then fills valleys and streams can significantly compromise water quality, often causing permanent damage to ecosystems and rendering streams unfit for swimming, fishing and drinking." The agency established a new purity standard for streams near coal mining areas, saying it was updating provisions of the Clean Water Act to set new conductivity levels. Conductivity is a measurement of how well water transmits an electrical charge and gives a reading on the amount of dissolved solids in water. The EPA set a maximum conductivity of 500 microSiemens per centimeter, which the agency says is about five times higher than a normal level and should "protect 95 percent of aquatic life in the coal regions." Emily Bernhardt, an associate professor of biology at Duke University, studies water quality in coal-mining areas. She told us conductivity is a "really inexpensive way to see if you have a lot of constituents in water." In coal-mining regions, she said, conductivity is correlated with sulfate. Pyrite, a mineral made up of coal and sulphur ions, is found in coal seams and filters into water. She said if water near coal mines has high conductivity, it usually contains a lot of sulfates and metals. Streams in mining areas often show elevated sulfur levels, as well as higher levels of iron, selenium and manganese. But the test is designed solely for rural Appalachia, not for use across the country. In urban areas, for example, high conductivity may occur when road salt is washed into streams. So how do Perrier and Evian seep into this debate? Beth Breeding, Griffith’s press secretary, told us the congressman’s comments were based on the EPA’s conductivity guidance. But the EPA website makes no mention of Perrier or other bottled waters. Griffith’s claim appears to come from Alpha Natural Resources, the nation’s third-largest coal mining company. A PowerPoint slide circulated by the company says Evian, Perrier and San Pellegrino would all fail EPA conductivity tests. We asked Rick Nida, a spokesman for Alpha, whether his company thinks the EPA test is a fair way to evaluate the impact of mountain-top mining. "We don’t think it’s a good standard to use," he said. "The point is rules are so stringent that bottle water doesn’t pass. Richard Yost, a spokesman for the EPA, said the standards are designed to protect aquatic species in the water, not necessarily determine whether the water is safe to drink. "The science demonstrates that stream life present in waters contaminated by mine waste is killed when salinity levels rise above levels that would not be toxic to humans who may drink such water," Yost said. "Aquatic organisms and people respond to salinity in very different ways, so it is not technically valid to make direct comparisons between healthy levels of salinity in central Appalachian streams and acceptable levels of salinity in drinking water." Rather than rely on Alpha’s conductivity data, we put these bottled waters to the test. Paul Bukaveckas, an associate professor of biology at Virginia Commonwealth University who studies river ecology, invited us to conduct the tests at his lab. Mac Lee, a laboratory specialist at VCU, used a sensor he and Bukaveckas employ on the James River. We tested the conductivity of distilled water, Evian, Perrier, Pellegrino and, last of all, a sample taken from the James River in downtown Richmond. Here were our test results: Distilled water: 2.2 microSiemens James River water: 139 microSiemens Evian: 584 microSiemens Perrier: 795 microSiemens San Pellegrino: 1266 microSimens So the bottled water has a conductivity level higher than the EPA’s 500 microSiemens threshold. We asked Bernhardt and Bukaveckas if that is a relevant piece of information. Bukaveckas, the VCU biologist, said the argument reminds him of those raised 20 years ago by power companies disputing the impact -- or even existence -- of acid rain. "They’d point to lakes and say, ‘These are naturally acidic.’ But if you did water tests, you’d find that undamaged lakes were acidic because of organic or naturally occurring acids," he said. The damaged lakes, in contrast, contained acids created by emissions from the smokestacks of power plants. Bernhardt, of Duke, said water is different in each environment, making a comparison between French springs and Appalachian streams pointless. "The EPA’s data find that high conductivity is most closely correlated with the loss of species," Bernhardt said about Appalachian water. "Salty water makes it harder for freshwater fish to live. So maybe it is bad for freshwater fish to be dumped in Pellegrino, but that’s not the right argument to have." Let’s review our findings. After conducting an independent test, we agree with Griffith’s claim that Perrier, Evian and Pellegrino all have conductivity levels above the limits the EPA sets for streams in Appalachian coal areas. But the fact that a Pellegrino bath could kill Virginia’s fish population is irrelevant to these water standards. According to independent water experts, high conductivity in coal country strongly correlates with the loss of aquatic species. Griffith sought to confuse the issue with a non sequitur about bottled water. Saying Perrier is good for humans and therefore must be OK for fish seems to us like saying that because humans eat oranges, fish should too. The congressman has ignored critical facts to give his constituents a skewed impression of an EPA rule. We rate the claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The article falsely claims that Gonzalez is on video admitting to bullying and ostracizing the Parkland shooter and saying she was justified in doing so. The website includes a video clip of a speech Gonzalez gave at a rally in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. She says: "Since he was in middle school, it was no surprise to anyone who knew him to hear that he was the shooter. Those talking about how we should not have ostracized him, you didn’t know this kid. Okay? We did." In reality, Gonzalez was responding to a tweet from President Donald Trump that implied people should have been more active in reporting the shooter’s disturbing behavior before people died. The full video clip showed Gonzalez talking about the shooter being mentally disturbed, but she never made any claims about bullying him. Here is Gonzalez’s comment in full context: "There is one tweet I would like to call attention to. ‘So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities again and again.’ We did, time and time again. Since he was in middle school, it was no surprise to anyone who knew him to hear that he was the shooter. Those talking about how we should have not ostracized him, you didn't know this kid. Okay, we did. We know that they are claiming mental health issues, and I am not a psychologist, but we need to pay attention to the fact that this was not just a mental health issue. He would not have harmed that many students with a knife." We found no other evidence to suggest that Gonzalez bullied Cruz. The article then refers to a tweet Gonzalez retweeted on March 27. The tweet from user @edennnnnn said: "If bullying caused school shootings, you would see trans shooters, queer shooters, female shooters, POC shooters. Bullying does not cause school shootings; entitlement does. And white boys are the most entitled demographic by far." Project Republic described Gonzalez’s retweet as sentiment to blaming "white boys’ entitlement" as the cause of all school shootings. But the tweet isn’t that specific in blaming all school shootings on entitlement. Project Republic has no evidence to show that Gonzalez bullied Cruz; she didn’t admit; and the retweet doesn’t say what Project Republic said. We rate the statement False.

pomt-12936	"About 8 out of 10 favor changing Obamacare significantly or replacing it altogether."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/10/mitch-mcconnell/mitch-mcconnell-says-favor-changing-Obamacare/	As congressional Republicans decide how to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., published an op-ed on FoxNews.com titled, "ObamaCare failed Americans. Now it's time for relief." "By nearly any measure, Obamacare has failed: It didn’t lower costs, it didn’t increase choice, middle-class families continue to lose health plans they were promised they could keep, and Americans continue to call for Obamacare’s repeal," McConnell wrote on Jan. 9. "They spoke loudly again this November, and about 8 out of 10 favor changing Obamacare significantly or replacing it altogether." "That doesn’t mean the law will end overnight," he continued. "There will be a stable transition period, and once repeal is passed we will turn to replacement policies that cost less and work better than what we have now." What caught our eye in this passage was McConnell’s citation of the eight of 10 figure. When we took a closer look, we found a credible source for it, but also some missing context. Let’s take a closer look. Where the number comes from McConnell’s office pointed to a Nov. 28, 2016, news release by Gallup that summarized one of its periodic polls on health care. The headline was, "Most Americans Want Changes to Affordable Care Act." Gallup’s release goes on to say, "Whatever the exact course of action that ensues once Trump and the new Congress take office, it is clear that about eight in 10 Americans favor changing the ACA significantly (43 percent) or replacing it altogether (37 percent)." This data is based on a survey conducted on Nov. 9 to Nov. 13, 2016. "The majority leader made an accurate statement that, according to Gallup, about 8 out of 10 favor changing Obamacare significantly or replacing it altogether," said Don Stewart, a spokesman for McConnell. "Given the myriad problems with the law and the impact on families, the poll was not a surprise." An outside specialist in health policy and polling, Robert J. Blendon of Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said McConnell has a good basis for supporting his claim, given Gallup’s framing of the results. "For years, politicians have taken what's in Gallup releases," Blendon said. Why it can be misinterpreted McConnell has been careful in how he relates what Gallup wrote. But the statistic's usefulness for supporting his larger point -- that Obamacare should be repealed in the way he's proposing -- is not as clear. Reading his op-ed, it’s easy to jump to the conclusion that 80 percent of Americans want to repeal the law. But that's not the case, according to the Gallup data. It’s true that only 14 percent of respondents said they would keep the law as is, and that’s less than the 37 percent who wanted to repeal the law entirely. However, a plurality of respondents -- 43 percent -- said they wanted to keep the law but make "significant changes" to it. Specifically, 28 percent said they approved of the law but wanted to see significant changes to it -- and this constituency included both people who generally approved of the law and those who generally disapproved of it. The inclusion of those who approve the law and want changes to it -- and who would be unlikely to be on board for a full repeal, as McConnell seeks -- is what inflates the number to 80 percent. Other recent surveys fill in some of the blanks about what these respondents might be thinking. An October 2016 survey by Harvard University’s Chan School and Politico gave respondents six options for handling the Affordable Care Act (not counting "don’t know," which registered 10 percent). The first three categories include people who either support the law or think it should go even further than it does today: Replace with universal Medicare: 14 percent Expand the existing program: 8 percent Keep the law as is: 18 percent Collectively, then, 40 percent either support an even stronger law or keeping the law as is. The other three categories align more closely with McConnell’s opinion, and they add up to 50 percent. Replace with a tax credit program: 16 percent Scale back and give states control: 14 percent Repeal completely: 20 percent The Politico-Harvard results broadly mirror other recent polls about repealing the Affordable Care Act. In general, more people favor a repeal than oppose one, but support levels for a repeal are in the 40 percent to 50 percent range, rather than the 80 percent range. For instance, a Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll taken in mid December 2016 found that 49 percent favored repeal, 47 percent opposed repeal, and 4 percent were unsure or refused to answer. Our ruling McConnell wrote that "Americans continue to call for Obamacare’s repeal. … About 8 out of 10 favor changing ObamaCare significantly or replacing it altogether." McConnell has carefully worded a statistic from a credible source, the Gallup news release. However, it's worth remembering that a notable share of people whose favored "significant" changes to the law either want a single-payer plan or an even stronger Obamacare law -- two options that are off the table for McConnell.

pomt-09221	"I got a letter from 20 people who said they wanted their money back, 14 never gave me a penny."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/may/17/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-people-asking-refunds-never-don/	Though he officially declared his "independence" by leaving the Republican Party on May 12, 2010, Florida Gov. Charlie Crist says he won't return money contributed to his U.S. Senate campaign while he was running as a Republican. "People gave to a good cause, and we're going to spend it on a good cause,'' Crist said minutes after switching his voter registration. "That's why I'm going to keep it. It's important to be able to get our message out and communicate with the people of Florida.'' The next day, in a wide-ranging interview with the editorial board of the St. Petersburg Times, the refund talk resurfaced. This time, Crist discussed a letter he received from 20 Republican heavyweights asking for refunds. He suggested that the letter was more a stunt than a sincere request. "I got a letter from 20 people who said they wanted their money back, 14 never gave me a penny," Crist told the Times, adding, "You gotta give it to me first before you can have the option." We wanted to see if Crist is right. The letter in question actually is published on Marco Rubio's Senate campaign website. It reads in part: "We helped to support, and yes to bankroll, your political career. For years you have been asking us for money. And for years we have put our names and credibility on the line by asking our friends to donate to you. Those days are over. "As part of your transition into this new phase of your political career, we respectfully request that you return every penny of donor money from every donor who asks for a refund. For those of us who have donated to your Senate campaign, you can start by refunding in full the contributions we have made. "Recent reports with the Federal Elections Commission indicate your campaign is sitting on a stockpile of approximately $7.6 million dollars in contributions. "Charlie, that is not your money." The letter is signed by mainly Florida Republicans, including former Florida GOP Chairman Al Cardenas, Outback Steakhouse executive Chris Sullivan, Palm Beach County GOP chair Sid Dinerstein and former U.S. Ambassador to Portugal Al Hoffman. Palm Beach Post reporter Mike Bender quickly took the list of letter writers and compared it to the list of Charlie Crist's campaign contributors. He published the results of his analysis on the Post's political blog. The analysis showed that of the 20 people listed on the letter, only nine actually donated to Crist's Senate campaign, and of the nine -- Hoffman -- got his contributions back in February 2010 (Hoffman asked for his money back in February over allegations of excessive spending by the Republican Party of Florida and Crist's hand-picked chairman Jim Greer). PolitiFact Florida checked Bender's reporting by searching the Federal Election Commission's electronic campaign database and came up with the same number. Here's a list of the signers and how much they contributed to Crist's campaign. Bill Becker, Vero Beach, FL - $0 Wayne Berman, Washington, D.C. - $0 Al Cardenas, Miami, FL - $4,800 Sid Dinerstein, Palm Beach Gardens, FL - $0 Ed Easton, Key Biscayne, FL - $2,400 Peter Feaman, Boynton Beach, FL - $500 Gay Gaines, Palm Beach, FL - $0 Phil Handy, Winter Park, FL - $0 Mike Hightower, Jacksonville, FL - $0 Charlie Hilton, Panama City, FL - $0 Ambassador Al Hoffman, North Palm Beach, FL - $4,800 Congressman Gary A. Lee, Ft. Myers, FL - $0 Anita Mitchell, West Palm Beach, FL - $0 Tom Petway, Jacksonville, FL - $2,400 Ambassador John Rood, Jacksonville, FL - $4,800 Peter Rummell, Jacksonville, FL - $4,800 Frank Schwerin, Naples, FL - $0 Jason Steele, Satellite Beach, FL - $0 Chris Sullivan, Tampa, FL - $4,800 Jason Unger, Tallahassee, FL - $2,400 Hilton did donate $2,000 to Crist's 1998 Senate campaign. The Post reported that one of the 20 to sign the letter, Gay Gaines of Palm Beach, hasn’t donated to Crist in at least 15 years. She gave $2,400 this year to Rubio. Crist, in his statement to the St. Petersburg Times editorial board, is off a little bit by saying 14 of the 20 have asked for a refund. Actually, 11 never gave Crist "a penny" for his 2010 Senate campaign. And a 12th person had his money back before sending the letter to Crist. That's close enough, however, to rate Crist's claim Mostly True.	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2010-05-17T14:34:42	2010-05-13	['None']
pomt-12193	"Twitter reaches only 15 percent of the population."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2017/jul/26/mark-cuban/mark-cuban-says-twitter-reaches-only-15-population/	Texas businessman and possible 2020 presidential aspirant Mark Cuban, who backed Hillary Clinton for president in 2016, challenged Kellyanne Conaway’s defense of President Donald Trump’s frequent Twitter posts by suggesting most Americans aren’t Twitter-philes. Cuban was reacting to a June 30, 2017, Fox News tweet quoting the White House counselor saying the president conveys his ideas through social media "because the middle man can't be trusted." "This is backwards," Cuban tweeted back. "Twitter reaches only ~ 15pct of population," Cuban said, adding: "For a tweet to reach the general population the MSM (mainstream media) has to report on it." Reporting matters. But it’s a reach to dismiss Twitter, which says its mission is to "give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly, without barriers." The California-based platform, which permits individuals and groups to post brief messages generally viewable to anyone who cares to peek, became a durable social-media phenomenon after its embrace at Austin’s South by Southwest in 2007. As of July 2017, the president’s @RealDonaldTrump Twitter account had more than 34 million followers. By then, Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, had 92 million followers, a "followership" built over many more years in politics. So, do just 15 percent of Americans see Twitter directly? Cuban’s backup Twitter itself says that as of the end of June 2017, it had 328 million monthly active users. The company said that 79 percent of Twitter accounts were based outside the United States. When we asked Cuban the basis of his cited 15 percent figure, he said by email that he saw it in a report in 2016. He said we could confirm the number by talking to any analyst of Twitter’s stock or by engaging the company. A stock analyst Our emails to Twitter media representatives went unanswered, but we connected with Perry Gold, a New York-based stock analyst identified by Twitter Inc. as one of more than 30 analysts of its stock. Gold, of MoffettNathanson LLC, a media and telecommunications research firm, pointed out internal metrics made public by Twitter covering the first quarter of 2017. In the four months, according to the figures, Twitter had 70 million monthly active U.S. users, up 3 million from the last four months of 2016, the company noted in an April 2017 letter to shareholders. Our run at perspective: The U.S. population was 323 million as of July 2016 including nearly 249 million residents age 18 or older, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. So you could assert, roughly, that 22 percent of all Americans engaged with Twitter in the first few months of 2017. Removing minors from the population count leaves you with nearly 249 million residents, perhaps opening the way to estimate that up to 28 percent of U.S. adults used Twitter in the year’s first quarter--again, a rough estimate. Gold also pointed out that according to a June 2017 ranking of digital media platforms by Comscore, a cross-platform measurement company, Twitter that month ranked 13th nationally with 110,290,000 unique U.S. visitors/viewers. At No. 1, per Comscore, Google had 241,433,000 unique U.S. visitors/viewers. Another speculative calculation: If you assume the Google count reflects nearly every U.S. user of the Internet, then you could say the count of Twitter’s unique visitors/viewers was about 46 percent of all the U.S. online population for the month. Experts caution We sought independent expert analysis from professors pointed out by Kathleen McElroy of the University of Texas including Dhiraj Murthy, author of a book on Twitter for social communication, who called "monthly active users," the indicator aired by Twitter, "a very difficult metric with lots of limitations as even bots or quite occasional users can be incorporated into these numbers, depending on how calculations are done." Most research agrees, Murthy said by email, that most tweets go unread or passed along. Meredith Clark, an assistant professor of journalism at the University of North Texas, and a University of North Carolina "big data" colleague, Deen Freelon, each suggested we consider the results of a Pew Research Center survey of 1,520 U.S. adults taken in March-April 2016 finding that while 79 percent of online Americans reported using Facebook, 24 percent reported using Twitter. "On a total population basis (accounting for Americans who do not use the internet at all)," Pew wrote, that means 68 percent of U.S. adults are Facebook users and 21 percent use Twitter. SOURCE: Web post, "24% of online adults (21% of all Americans) use Twitter," Pew Research Center, Nov. 10, 2016 Per Twitter, survey respondents were asked: "Do you ever use the internet or a mobile app to use Twitter?" While 24 percent said yes to the query, 75 percent had not ever done so, Pew found. "Roughly one-quarter of online adults (24%) use Twitter, a proportion that is statistically unchanged from a survey conducted in 2015 (23%). "Younger Americans are more likely than older Americans to be on Twitter. Some 36% of online adults ages 18-29 are on the social network, more than triple the share among online adults ages 65 and older (just 10% of whom are Twitter users). "Twitter is also somewhat more popular among the highly educated: 29% of internet users with college degrees use Twitter, compared with 20% of those with high school degrees or less," Pew said. Both professors saw potential complications in Cuban’s statement. Clark said by email: "Cuban's claim rests on the assumption that everyone has an equal probability of seeing any other user's tweets, which we don't, because of Twitter's algorithms and our own decisions on whom to follow, re-tweet, mute, block, etc.," Clark wrote. Freelon elaborated: "Philosophically, your rating of Mr. Cuban's statement may depend on how the term ‘reach’ is defined. Limiting the focus to people who see a tweet directly on Twitter is one approach," he wrote, "but some tweets get seen because they’re mentioned in news coverage or discussed elsewhere online. Freelon said a "liberal definition of the term ‘reach’ pulls in many more people. Exactly" how "many is probably impossible to say with any degree of certainty." Our ruling Cuban said: "Twitter reaches only 15 percent of the population." A 2016 survey and more recent Twitter metrics suggest that around 21 percent of U.S. residents at least peek at tweets. Cuban’s larger point--that most of us are not Twitter-locked--holds up. We rate the claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-01538	Of the 98 top oxycodone-dispensing doctors who used to live in Florida, "today, there are none."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/sep/16/pam-bondi/attorney-general-pam-bondi-says-floridas-pill-mill/	Attorney General Pam Bondi has launched her re-election advertising campaign with a major milestone in Florida law enforcement: The death of the state’s infamous "pill mills." In a Sept. 8 TV commercial, the incumbent touts her record of overseeing the demise of rampant prescription drug abuse enabled by Florida doctors. "With our amazing law enforcement, we closed down the pill mills," Bondi said. "Of the top 100 oxycodone-­dispensing doctors in this country, 98 of them lived in Florida. Today, there are none." That statistic implies Bondi was tough on crime, but PolitiFact Florida wanted to know if it was accurate. Closing the clinics The pill mill epidemic was a nationwide problem in 2010, driven by doctors who would write prescriptions and sell drugs out of clinics they owned themselves. Florida’s lax laws gave the Sunshine State a reputation for easy access to the drug, so much so that billboards advertised to "narco tourists" -- buyers from out of state who would come to Florida to buy the drug. With more than 1,000 pain clinics in operation across the state, Florida became known as the "Oxy Express." Bondi, who was elected in 2010, was a staunch supporter of HB 7095, a 2011 law that increased penalties for doctors who abused prescription privileges, banned them from prescribing drugs like oxycodone and strengthened state regulatory power over prescription pill trafficking. The bill passed both houses of the Legislature unanimously on May 6, 2011, and was signed by Gov. Rick Scott on June 3, 2011. Bondi’s camp told PolitiFact Florida the stat in the commercial came from the Statewide Task Force on Prescription Drug Abuse & Newborns 2014 Progress Report, which specifically dealt with the effects of opiate abuse by pregnant women on their children. The report credited changes in Florida law that shut down many clinics. "In 2010, 98 of the top 100 oxycodone pill dispensing physicians nationally resided in Florida," the report read. "In 2011, after the passage of HB 7095, only 13 of the top 100 resided in Florida, and by the end of 2012, not one Florida doctor appeared on the top 100 list." The report, which used figures that also were widely reported by the media, cited U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration data accessed January 2013. Bondi’s office also gave us a DEA press release from April 5, 2013, to back up that claim -- although that release said "90 of the top 100 oxycodone purchasing physicians in the nation were located in Florida." When we asked the attorney general’s office why there was a discrepancy in the numbers, they insisted the number was 98. The DEA stood firm, however: In 2010, the number was 90 of the top 100 oxycodone-purchasing doctors. The federal agency also told us the number of doctors in Florida in 2011, after HB 7095 passed, was down to 10 and not 13. But wait, Bondi’s commercial says "oxycodone-dispensing doctors," not "purchasing," as the DEA measured in 2010. That’s because the 2011 law no longer allowed physicians to simply buy the drug to resell, DEA public information officer Mia Ro told PolitiFact Florida. "When the Florida law changed, it prevented physicians from dispensing pills out of their clinics," Ro said. The agency doesn’t track "what’s filled or prescribed," she said. That means the DEA numbers weren’t tracking whether or not actual abuse had happened, just that Florida doctors were buying lots of oxycodone. Some physicians are still allowed to buy hydrocodone in large quantities, Ro said -- emergency room personnel, for example -- but private doctors could no longer buy the drug and sell it on their own. There was one unnamed DEA registrant from Florida who was in the top 100 oxycodone buyers in 2014, Ro said: A purchaser for a fleet of cruise ships, to use the drug in the fleet’s sick bays. That’s not to say pill mills weren’t a problem, or that the 2011 law didn’t make a difference. By the time HB 7095 was enacted, it was estimated as many as 11 people per day were dying from prescription drug abuse. From 2010 to 2012, overdose deaths from prescription drugs, illicit drugs and alcohol dropped nearly 17 percent, and overall prescription drug fatalities fell 23 percent, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report. About 52 percent of that decrease was in deaths from oxycodone. Our ruling Bondi said that of the top 100 oxycodone-dispensing doctors, 98 were in Florida, and "today, there are none." She cited DEA numbers that since 2010, the number of physicians who dispensed the most oxycodone in the nation and also lived in Florida had dropped from 98 of the top 100 to zero. The DEA told us there are a few problems with that stat. First, it was for the biggest purchasers of oxycodone, not dispensers -- the DEA said the list didn't track dispensation. Second, the number in 2010 was 90 and not 98, although the 98 figure was widely reported by the state and the media in the past few years. Third, in 2014 there was one top 100 oxycodone purchaser in Florida, a buyer for a cruise ship fleet. The DEA data only tracks top purchasers, not whether actual drug use decreased, but other sources confirmed oxycodone abuse is on a downward trend in the state, although there’s debate over whether a 2011 law Bondi supported is the sole factor. While the specifics are a bit off, the gist and context of what Bondi is saying is accurate: There are no more Florida pill mill doctors in the DEA’s top 100. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-07406	The Bush tax cuts "helped to create a substantial part of the deficit."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/apr/29/dennis-kucinich/rep-dennis-kucinich-says-bush-tax-cuts-caused-subs/	Cutting spending to reduce the deficit has been the focus of budget talks since Congress convened in January. Doubts that President Obama and House Republicans can do it by reconciling their deficit-cutting plans led the ratings agency Standard and Poor’s to lower its outlook on the United States from "stable" to "negative." It led S&P to warn that the U.S. could lose its coveted status as the world’s most secure economy if lawmakers don’t agree to bring spending in line with revenue. The GOP plan, approved by the House, would lower taxes on corporations and the wealthiest Americans and draw the bulk of its savings from cutting federal health care programs. Obama's plan would raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans and reduce military and domestic spending. House Speaker John Boehner answered it by declaring tax increases "a non-starter." "We don’t have deficits because Americans are taxed too little, we have deficits because Washington spends too much," said the Republican from West Chester in Southwest Ohio. From both the other end of state and the political spectrum, Rep. Dennis Kucinich also said he was unsatisfied by the president's plan. But the Cleveland Democrat said he favored Obama's intention to end the so-called Bush tax cuts for the wealthy. The tax cuts, he said, "helped to create a substantial part of the deficit." Boehner's comment about too much spending was a statement of opinion. PolitiFact Ohio can't rate it. But we can look at Kucinich's claim about the tax cuts, which runs contrary to assertions that tax cuts pay for themselves. The Bush tax cuts refer to two pieces of legislation -- the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 -- that were enacted under President George W. Bush and written to expire at the end of 2010. They were extended for two years in December. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service examined them in "The Bush Tax Cuts and the Economy," a report issued last December, and in an earlier study of budget deficits and major legislation. Back in 2001, CRS said, the Congressional Budget Office projected gradually rising federal budget surpluses for the next decade. The tax cuts helped alter the outlook "dramatically," and the budget in 2002 recorded a deficit for the first time since 1997. "The Bush tax cuts, with a $1 trillion 10-year price tag, contributed to this shift from budget surpluses to deficits," CRS said. Other contributors included the 2001 recession, the increase in defense spending for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the Medicare prescription drug benefit. But the tax cuts "generated the largest 10-year increases in budget deficits," CRS said. Estimates by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation put the total cost for the tax cuts (including the Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004) at more than the amount allocated to the Defense Department for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. "This means that even with the spending for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the federal budget would have been in surplus in 2007 if the tax cuts had not been enacted, or if their costs had been offset," said a 2008 analysis from the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The CBO last year projected a decrease in deficits if the tax cuts expired, and said extending all of them permanently would cost $3.3 trillion over 10 years and increase deficits. PolitiFact has previously examined assertions that tax cuts increase revenues by stimulating economic growth. We found that the Congressional Budget Office, the Treasury Department, the Joint Committee on Taxation and the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers say that tax cuts lead to revenues that are lower than they otherwise would have been – even if they spur some economic growth. "There's no clear relationship between taxes and economic growth," said Bob Williams of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. "Too many factors complicate the picture to draw clear conclusions about the taxes-growth relationship." Our colleagues at FactCheck.org came to a similar conclusion. Additionally, the Congressional Budget Office reported in March, "Relative to the size of the economy, federal revenues are currently at their lowest level in 60 years." "There is no real dispute among economists that broad-based federal income tax cuts reduce revenue (except when tax rates are much higher than they are now)," said Alan D. Viard of the conservative American Enterprise Institute. "Revenue is lower than it would be without the Bush tax cuts -- liberal and conservative economists are in accord on this question." Debate will go on about the effectiveness of tax cuts in stimulating growth. We won't enter it. But analysis backs up Kucinich in saying that the Bush cuts "helped to create a substantial part of the deficit." We rate his statement as True.

pomt-08628	"Wisconsin is one of the highest taxed states in the nation."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/19/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-wisconsin-one-highest-taxed-stat/	In an effort to link taxes to the lack of job creation in Wisconsin, Republican gubernatorial candidate Scott Walker is highlighting complaints that Wisconsin’s taxes are too high. "Wisconsin is one of the highest taxed states in the nation, and it is no coincidence that our jobs are disappearing," Walker’s campaign website says. "Runaway government spending, paid for with high taxes, has led to the worst state unemployment rate in a generation. In the last year, Wisconsin lost a record-setting 130,000 jobs, and employers continue to lay off workers by the thousands. "From Harley-Davidson laying off hundreds of workers to Thomas Industries closing its doors in Sheboygan, one thing is clear: Wisconsin is not competitive. Other states are taking our jobs, and this must change." The question of the impact of taxes on job creation is a complicated one, and one hotly debated by candidates and economists alike. The question of where Wisconsin ranks is a bit easier to sort out. So is Walker correct? Are we "one of the highest taxed states in the nation"? The Journal Sentinel spent months examining tax burden rankings earlier this year and documented how far Wisconsin had fallen from its top-5 rating in recent years. The trend had received little attention up to that point, and in case you missed the April article, here’s a recap. (Some of the rankings are updated based on new Census Bureau data released this summer.) Under the latest figures, Wisconsin ranks 13th among the states for total tax burden. It was 14th the previous year -- the focus of the Journal Sentinel article. Those rankings measure total state and local taxes as a percentage of personal income. Wisconsin’s taxes are about 5 percent more than the national average. By another measure, taxation per person, the state was 18th in the latest rankings and its average burden was 1 percent below the national average. The year before it was 20th. The per-person measure is widely used but not as commonly as the income-based rank. The tax burden rank includes sales, property, income, fuel, alcohol and cigarette taxes, among others. The state ranks 12th on individual income tax burden, 8th on property taxes, 23rd on corporate income tax burden and 33rd on sales tax burden. Now, let’s look at the spending side of the ledger. Wisconsin is 25th of 50 in spending, with its governmental units consuming about 20 cents of every dollar of total personal income. That’s 1.5 percent above the national average. Wisconsin’s tax rank is higher than its spending rank because spending is also paid for by fees and federal revenues -- two sources Wisconsin relies less on than other states. Jill Bader, the Walker campaign’s spokeswoman, said the claim of "one of the highest in the nation" is based on three things. First, by the campaign’s accounting, Wisconsin’s total tax burden on income is right on the cusp of the top 10 because several states are bunched closely around the 11th spot. If you round up the tax burden percentage it’s a tie at that spot, instead of a 13th ranking, Bader said. The campaign also cites an informal prediction made in 2009 by Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, a research organization. Berry speculated that the big state tax increases enacted by Gov. Jim Doyle and the Legislature for 2010 and 2011 might eventually push the state back into the top 10, even as high as 6th. Because there is a two-year lag in Census Bureau tax data, those tax increases are not yet reflected in the rankings -- and won’t be until 2012. Finally, the campaign cites a national study by the Tax Foundation, a conservative research organization, that ranks Wisconsin in the bottom 10 of states on "business tax climate." Wisconsin was rated 42nd. So let’s take a look at the evidence and the Walker claim. Overall tax rank It may seem to be splitting hairs to distinguish between states when some are bunched up fairly tight. But that’s the way the tax rank game has always been played -- by researchers, politicians and the media -- so it’s not fair to change the rules now. We don’t remember hearing anybody rounding Wisconsin down to nearby states when we were top 5. When Wisconsin was ranked in the top 5 tax states, few would have disputed the state was among the highest. Now that Wisconsin has fallen to 13th in the latest rankings, on one measure, and 18th by another, we think the "one of the highest" claim misses the mark. When you factor in fees, which some consider taxes by another name, the state’s rank is 17th. Predicting the future Todd Berry’s prediction that the state will rise into the top 10 again is, he acknowledged in an interview, based on informed speculation. Only six states enacted bigger tax increases in 2009, so that’s a point in favor of Berry’s prognostication. But predicting future ranks is an imprecise science, at best, and his crystal ball doesn’t provide solid evidence of Walker’s claim, which is based on current rankings. Business taxes It strikes us as legitimate for Walker to base his claim in part on narrow business tax rankings. After all, he makes the statement in the context of businesses making hiring decisions. But he cherry-picks one study from the Tax Foundation, which criticizes states like Wisconsin that have progressive income taxation, under which high-income individuals pay at higher rates. If you look at that study, Wisconsin ranks at or near the middle of the pack on most of the taxes examined. The corporate income tax, for example, is in the bottom half of states in the study. Census figures put it just into the top half, but well below the national average. But the Tax Foundation penalizes Wisconsin overall because its individual income tax burden is 8th-highest. The foundation downgrades states that have a particularly high tax of one kind or another. Other studies by business-oriented groups portray Wisconsin’s business taxes in a much different light than the Tax Foundation’s study. Business taxes in Wisconsin are in the lower half of states based on how much those taxes consume of a state’s private sector economic production, according to a 2009 study prepared for the Council On State Taxation, a group of big corporations. So, to sum up: Walker claims that Wisconsin is "one of the highest taxed states." His campaign rounds the numbers up to put the state closer to the top 10 and it relies on a researcher’s prediction that is informed but speculative. The campaign also cherry-picks a study by a conservative group that finds business taxes are high, but it does not account for other data that show Wisconsin’s business taxes are middle or low. Overall, we found the state ranked 13th for total tax burden in rankings released this year and 14th in last year’s. There is some room for argument over what "one of the highest" means. But when you look at all state and local taxes combined, we think it’s a stretch to put Wisconsin’s current ranking up on that pedestal. We find Walker’s claim to be Half True.

pomt-10154	"John McCain said...in December he was surprised there was a subprime mortgage problem."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/02/joe-biden/biden-more-or-less-right-on-mccains-subprime-surpr/	On two occasions in the vice presidential debate, Sen. Joe Biden alleged that Sen. John McCain said some time ago that the mortgage crisis had taken him by surprise. "Two years ago Barack Obama warned about the subprime mortgage crisis," Biden said early in the Oct. 2, 2008, debate. "John McCain said shortly after that in December he was surprised there was a subprime mortgage problem." Then a few minutes later Biden said: "John McCain said as early as last December, quote – I'm paraphrasing – 'I'm surprised about this subprime mortgage crisis.'" This was likely an attempt to mute McCain and Gov. Sarah Palin's recent touting of McCain's advocacy in 2006 for stricter oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the federally sponsored mortgage companies. McCain has cited that position to suggest he saw the mortgage crisis coming. (Indeed McCain did support more oversight of Fannie and Freddie, as we reported here .) But is it true that McCain said he was "surprised" at the mortgage crisis? We believe Biden was referring to McCain's remarks in this interview with the editorial board of the Keene Sentinel , a newspaper in New Hampshire, on Nov. 4, 2007. Turning to the subject of the mortgage crisis, one of the journalists asked him: "The dimension of this problem may be surprising to a lot of people, but to many people, many others, there were feelings that there was something amiss, something was going too fast, something was a little too hot, going back several years. Were you one of them? Or, you're a busy guy, you're looking at a lot of things, maybe subprime mortgages wasn't something you focused on every day. Were you surprised?" McCain: "Yeah. And I was surprised at the dot-com collapse, and I was surprised at other times in our history – I don't know if 'surprised' is the word, but –" Question: "S&L's?" McCain: "Yeah the S&L –" Question: "Is this bigger than that?" McCain: "You know, I don't know the dimensions of this. It's hard to know what the dimensions of it are. As I say, I never thought I'd pick up the paper and see a city in Norway somehow dramatically impacted by it. When I say 'surprised,' uh, I'm not surprised when in capitalist systems that there's greed and excess. I think it was Teddy Roosevelt who said unfettered capitalism leads to corruption or something like that..." McCain went on to say that a handful of people, including an adviser of his, Doug Holtz-Eakin, did sense something amiss in the economy. But he concluded with this: "I'd like to tell you I did anticipate it, but I have to give you straight talk, I did not." So yes, McCain said the mortgage crisis surprised him. And he concluded by acknowledging flat-out that he did not anticipate the crisis. So there is certainly truth to Biden's accusation. But McCain also said he didn't know if 'surprised' was the word. And he issued a blanket caveat about how greed and excess among capitalists never surprised him. So the context undermines Biden's claim a bit. (Not to mention that Biden flubbed the month that McCain made his comments.) We give Biden a Mostly True.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2008-10-02T00:00:00	2008-10-02	['None']
pomt-07859	Says the foreman of the jury that convicted him was a Greenpeace activist.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/feb/10/tom-delay/tom-delay-says-foreman-jury-convicted-him-was-gree/	Tom DeLay, the Republican former U.S. House majority leader convicted in Austin of laundering corporate contributions to bolster Texas House candidates, insisted he did no wrong and that the the case against him was just politics. In a Jan. 13 interview, DeLay told Matt Lauer, host of NBC-TV’s "Today," that his indictment and trial was driven by liberal Democrats and that the "foreman of the jury was a Greenpeace activist." Greenpeace is an international group that calls itself the leading independent "campaigning organization that uses peaceful direct action and creative communication" to expose and promote solutions to global environmental problems. "The point is is that this is a political campaign" against me, DeLay said. Greenpeace v. DeLay? We wanted background. An online search of news coverage showed that The Houston Chronicle identified the jury foreman in a Nov. 23 news article saying in part that the "forewoman" is a Greenpeace activist named Katie Stotts. The article’s author, R.G. Ratcliffe, told us in an interview that courtroom observers learned Stotts’ name when the judge inadvertently said it aloud. Ratcliffe said the Greenpeace information came from an entry on Stotts’ Facebook page indicating that she’d enthusiastically answered an invitation to a Greenpeace event. In our own Facebook check, we found that someone identified as Katarina von Stottsen said "HELL YES" to attending a September 2009 Greenpeace party in Austin. After DeLay’s trial, a letter from Katie Stotts of Austin appeared Nov. 30 on the Austin American-Statesman’s editorial page. In the letter, Stotts says that she was a juror in the trial, adding: "We did have a good mix of political affiliations on the jury, but what it came down to wasn't political sides. It took us three very difficult and intense days to come to a decision because we were considering all of the evidence to ensure that we came to the right decision." Stotts’ letter continues: "For those out there crying ‘liberal,’ they don't have a leg to stand on. It is an insult to my fellow jurors and I who put our lives on hold, and poured every last bit of our energy into making certain that a fair outcome was reached based only on the evidence, not any sort of political agenda... We performed our civil service with honesty and integrity, and stereotypes have no place in that." The letter makes no mention of Greenpeace. DeLay’s daughter, Dani DeLay Garcia, who sometimes serves as his spokeswoman, told us by e-mail that the foreman "wrote that she was a Greenpeace activist on her questionnaire," referring to written questions answered by prospective jurors before jury selection. Garcia also said she’s been told the questionnaires are public record. Not so, advised Michelle Brinkman, chief deputy clerk for the Travis County District Clerk’s office. She noted that the state’s Code of Criminal Procedure says information about a person collected by a court during jury selection is confidential and may not be disclosed unless a party to the trial or bona fide member of the news media applies for it. Then, "on a showing of good cause, the court shall permit disclosure," the law says. At our request, Brinkman asked the judge who presided over DeLay’s trial if questionnaire responses were available. The judge, Pat Priest, replied to her by e-mail Jan. 31: "I don't think we need dance either to Mr. DeLay's tune or to the reporter's, and the jurors made it clear they want their privacy protected. Tell him the information is unavailable." The same day, we reached Dick DeGuerin, DeLay’s lawyer in the case. DeGuerin declined to share a copy of Stotts’ questionnaire responses. But, he said, Stotts partly answered a question about club memberships including political involvements by writing: "I am a paying member of Greenpeace." DeGuerin said she answered the next question, per volunteer activities, with: "I’ve been to multiple rallies for environmental preservation issues." In a follow-up interview, DeGuerin said he did not use any allotted pre-emptory challenges to strike Stotts from the jury. "There were others" in the jury pool "much more objectionable," DeGuerin said. "I wish I’d had 20 strikes." Finally, we reached an Austin-area Greenpeace leader, who referred us to the group’s Washington spokesman, Joe Smyth. Smyth had no comment about Stotts but said via e-mail: "Every citizen enjoys the rights and responsibilities of citizenship, including serving on a jury, so it's bizarre that Tom Delay seems to think he can blame his criminal conviction on someone's politics or membership in an organization." Upshot: While Stotts reportedly self-identified as a Greenpeace backer, we’d need more information to deem her a Greenpeace activist. We rate DeLay’s statement Mostly True. UPDATE, 10:30 a.m. Feb. 11, 2011: After we published this article, Stotts responded to our Jan. 31 e-mail seeking comment. Stotts replied Feb. 10: "I contribute monetarily to Greenpeace, but I am not a Greenpeace activist. I went to, at most, a few local environmental rallies because a good friend of mine used to work for their organization. I have probably volunteered more times for the food bank in Austin than I have for official Greenpeace events. I also work for a conservative insurance company, but neither of these things had an effect on my ability to render an honest and fair verdict in the trial."

pomt-03629	"The port provides more than 297,000 jobs directly to the state of Georgia."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/may/06/johnny-isakson/isakson-ports-claim-target/	The deepening of the Georgia ports is one of the few issues in this state that has the support of the state’s top elected officials regardless of party affiliation. Shortly before President Barack Obama unveiled his proposed budget, U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., made his case for why more federal funding is necessary for the project. "There is nothing bigger right now for the entire state," Isakson said in a meeting with the Albany Herald’s editorial board, referring to the project. "The port provides more than 297,000 jobs directly to the state of Georgia." Isakson’s comments were picked up by several news sites across Georgia. We were curious if Isakson’s numbers were accurate and if there was any context missing. In 2015, a project to expand the Panama Canal is scheduled to be completed, allowing larger cargo ships to sail to America’s Eastern Seaboard. Political and business leaders in Georgia believe the deepening of the Savannah River will allow some of those larger ships to dock at its ports, thereby creating more jobs and boosting the Peach State’s economy. As an example of the significance of this issue, Georgia’s most prominent Republican and Democrat, Gov. Nathan Deal and Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, have worked together extensively to encourage Obama administration officials to provide more money for the ports. A week after Isakson’s comments, the White House released the president’s proposed budget. To the dismay of many Georgians involved in the Savannah project, the budget set aside $1.28 million to deepen the Savannah River, a drop in the bucket for the $652 million project. Georgia taxpayers already have put up $231 million, and the state will need to come up with at least $30 million under the federal-state formula to deepen the river. Isakson spokeswoman Lauren Culbertson forwarded us a report that referred to ports -- plural -- to back up his claim. The report was released in April 2010 and prepared by Jeff Humphreys, director of the University of Georgia’s Selig Center for Economic Growth. The report says there were 295,422 full- and part-time jobs in Georgia supported by the ports during the state of Georgia’s fiscal year 2009, which began July 1, 2008, and ended June 30, 2009. We had two specific issues. The first was that Isakson did not mention other ports in his comments. While the overwhelming bulk of the jobs are attributable to the Savannah port, a number of the jobs came from the Port of Brunswick and other private ports scattered along the Georgia coastline, according to Humphreys’ report. Culbertson agreed that the report included other ports. Humphreys said the senator may have generalized by referring solely to the Savannah port, since it is Georgia’s largest port. "It’s quite understandable," Humphreys said. The Savannah port generates an estimated $447 million in annual federal, state and local taxes, according to Humphreys’ most recent research. The Brunswick port, which is about an hour drive from Savannah, brings in about $23 million a year in tax revenue. Our other issue concerned whether all of these jobs could be directly attributed to the ports, as Isakson seems to have implied in his remarks to the newspaper’s editorial board. There is a more recent report on the ports, released in April 2012, as opposed to the report Isakson cited from 2010. In the newest report, Humphreys estimated there were about 352,000 full-time and part-time jobs resulting from the ports. Humphreys said 154,000 jobs could be attributed to companies that use the ports, and the remaining 198,000 jobs were indirectly a result from the ports. Humphreys said it’s valid for Isakson to include all of these jobs. Those indirect jobs, Humphreys said, range from companies that work with businesses at the port, to the diners that feed port workers. Humphreys also used the word "port-dependent jobs" to describe "indirect jobs." "It’s semantics," Humphreys said of the difference between "port-dependent jobs" and "indirect jobs." These jobs are across the state, the economist said. Although Chatham County is home to the Savannah port, Humphreys’ study concludes Fulton County is the recipient of more jobs from the ports. Humphreys didn’t quibble much with the senator’s argument. "Unfortunately, his numbers are a little out of date," Humphreys said. "In my opinion, he’s basically telling the truth." To sum up, Isakson said the Savannah port provides about 297,000 direct jobs to Georgia’s economy. The senator would have been more accurate if he said "port industry" or simply said "ports." Isakson underestimated the jobs impact in his argument. His estimate was based on a 2010 report, although the most recent report estimated the total at 352,000 jobs. Isakson’s remarks were not precise, but they are largely on target. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Johnny Isakson	None	None	None	2013-05-06T06:00:00	2013-04-05	['None']
pomt-12210	Just 6 percent of Americans say Russia is the country’s most important issue, yet the story receives "75 percent of the coverage" in the media.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/23/kellyanne-conway/does-russia-take-75-percent-media-coverage/	The White House says the media is hostile to the president and is using some new evidence presented by a conservative blogger to make its case. But that evidence is faulty. On Fox News on Saturday, Kellyanne Conway, one of President Donald Trump’s top advisers, argued that the media blocks important White House messaging by covering issues the public sees as unimportant. "This is a media that has decided it’s going be very hostile," Conway told Fox News host Jeanine Pirro on July 22, 2017. Conway then cited two different bits of research to contrast the percentage of news coverage devoted to different political issues and the public’s general interest in each issue. "People were asked, which of the following issues is most important to you?" Conway said. "Health care, 35 percent (of people said it was the most important issue, but it) got like 10 percent of the coverage. Russia, 6 percent most important issue, received 75 percent of the coverage. Immigration, 10 percent most important issue, zero percent of the coverage." New White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders made a similar claim on ABC’s This Week. "Look, there was a Wall Street Journal poll that came out this week that showed that the top three issues that Americans care about are immigration, health care, and jobs. The top three issues that the media cares about are Russia, Russia, and Russia," Huckabee Sanders said. "There's 15 times more coverage on Russia than on the three big issues that Americans care about. That's a problem. That's exactly the definition of Russia fever." The poll Huckabee Sanders is talking about came from Bloomberg, not the Wall Street Journal, and it found that health, jobs and terrorism were the top three important issues among respondents (not immigration, health care and jobs). That said, we wondered more broadly if the White House’s claim the media is devoting 75 percent of its coverage to the Russia investigation while few people claim it is the country’s most important issue. Genesis of this claim Conway’s claim stems from a post on the conservative blog Ricochet.com comparing a Bloomberg poll that asked Americans what they see as the most important issue facing the country right now to a June 27 Media Research Center survey of the time broadcast networks’ evening newscasts devoted to different issues. Bloomberg’s poll found that six percent of Americans said the United States’ "relationship with Russia" is the most important issue facing the country right now, behind health care, immigration, jobs, terrorism and even climate change. The Media Research Center, a conservative group, tracked coverage on the network news broadcasts of ABC, CBS and NBC from May 17 to June 20. The Ricochet’s Jon Gabriel put these two pieces of information together. He concluded that of 469 combined minutes of coverage of Trump during those broadcasts, 353 focused on either the firing of former FBI Director James Comey or Russia. Put another way, of the broadcasts it analyzed, the Media Research Center found 75 of coverage of Trump focused on questions about Comey or Trump. "The media have shown how drastically out of step they are with their own audience. If they want to earn back their hemorrhaging Nielsen numbers, perhaps they can spend time on something other than Russia Russia Russia." Where Conway’s claim falls apart Upon deeper analysis, however, the numbers don’t hold up. And experts we spoke to raised serious flaws in comparing the two pieces of research. The Ricochet post misreads the Media Research Center analysis. The Ricochet post appears to use this Media Research Center graphic to count the number of minutes the evening news talked about Trump. Those categories total 469 minutes, 75 percent of which are about Russia/Comey stories. But the Media Research Center said that it found 640 minutes of total coverage of Trump in its analysis not 469 minutes. That means, excluding anything else, that airtime devoted to the Russia probe constituted 55 percent of all coverage of the Trump presidency during the five weeks following the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller. It’s also worth making clear that the Media Research Center study was only analyzing coverage of Trump, not all media coverage. The Media Research Center analysis is limited. It is important to note that this study was only looking at network evening newscasts from ABC, CBS and NBC. It doesn’t include Fox or Fox News, CNN, MSNBC or any other cable news channel. It also doesn’t include newspapers or radio or online publications like Politico. On top of that, the analysis only covers about a month (May 17-June 20). "A more extensive study would likely have somewhat different results of individual news outlets," said Stephen Farnsworth, director of University of Mary Washington's Center for Leadership and Media Studies. "One of the things you see when you compare newspapers with television is a much wider range of topics being discussed, much more material than in a 30-minute news broadcast." Other polls show that Americans are interested in the Russia investigation. The question in the Bloomberg poll Conway referenced was not about the Russia investigation. Other polls suggest that Americans are interested in the investigation. A June poll by the Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 48 percent of people surveyed said they were extremely or very concerned that Trump or others involved with his campaign had inappropriate contacts with the Russian government during last year’s presidential campaign. Another 20 percent said they were moderately concerned. The White House and Trump play a role in setting what’s covered. Experts told us that it’s also worth noting that the media often covers what elected officials say or do. So if they’re talking more about Russia, the media will, too. Farnsworth pointed to a dearth of committee hearings and public debate on recent Republican health care legislation and the newsworthiness of firing an FBI director. Albert May, Associate Emeritus Professor of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University, said Trump’s tweets calling attention to the Russia probe has helped fuel more coverage. At the same time, Trump has kept a relatively quiet public schedule, May said. None of the experts we talked with were surprised by the schism between the public’s policy concerns and the media’s coverage of the issue. "The longstanding criticism of the press is that you focus on the scandal and not the policy issue like health care, but the truth is that’s what people are most interested in," May said. "The media's issue agenda and the public's issue agenda are never a perfect match," said Thomas Patterson, a Bradlee Professor of Government and the Press at Harvard. "Typically, the public ranks a scandal below policy issues when asked in a poll their opinion of ‘the nation's most important problem.’ So I think what we're seeing in the numbers is business as usual by the national press." Our ruling Conway said just 6 percent of Americans say Russia is the country’s most important issue, yet the story receives "75 percent of the coverage" in the media. A credible national poll found that six percent of Americans listed the U.S.-Russian relationship as the country’s most important issue. The question did not include any discussion of investigating whether Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. At the same time, an analysis by a conservative research organization shows that network news on ABC, NBC and CBS have made the Russia story an integral part of their Trump coverage. But experts caution about reading too much into the network news analysis, which is limited in scope. And either way, Conway’s numbers are off by 20 percentage points.

pomt-06814	There are cities and counties in Georgia that don’t have websites, and where elected officials don’t have email addresses.	true	/georgia/statements/2011/aug/12/sam-olens/olens-some-georgia-counties-cities-lack-websites-e/	A recent statement by state Attorney General Sam Olens had PolitiFact Georgia musing on the quirks of our digital age. Thanks to the Internet, you can track your ex’s new girlfriend on Facebook. You can watch a YouTube video of recording artist Nicki Minaj’s wardrobe malfunction, over and over again. You can even buy a 1963 Studebaker on eBay while reclining in your Barcalounger. But email your county commissioner? That’s not so simple, Olens told attendees at an Atlanta Press Club breakfast Aug. 4. The subject came up as Olens talked about the state’s open records and meetings laws, which journalists use to ferret out government corruption. It’s a bad idea to require all governments to use the Internet to inform residents about meetings, Olens told breakfast-goers. "[K]eep in mind, we still have cities and counties where the elected officials don’t have email addresses, where there are no websites," Olens said. No emails or websites? Surely, Olens jests. Nowadays, even pet cats have their own websites. Really. It so happens that the Association County Commissioners of Georgia, a group that represents county governments, conducted a survey in July to see which counties lacked websites. They found 30. The state Attorney General’s Office sent us a list of those counties, as well as information from the Georgia Municipal Association, which represents cities and towns statewide. The GMA lists 217 municipalities that don’t have their own websites. Some of these governments have a Web presence on a local chamber of commerce or regional development website but do not control or operate them, said Beth Brown, a spokeswoman for the ACCG. They often don’t have enough staff or money to run a website, spokeswomen for both groups told us. Others are so remote they can’t get high-speed Internet access. Consider Taliaferro County. In 2009, an estimated 1,812 residents lived in all of its 195.4 square miles, according to census and state data. Their commissioners work part time, so officials don’t see a need to spend the resources to give them their own accounts, the county clerk told us. Bacon County gives email addresses to elected officials who ask for them, but not all of them in this county of about 10,600 do. Their one-man IT department hopes to get the county’s official website up soon. It just takes a lot of manpower to get it done, he said. The city of Walthourville, population 4,000, just started its website this year and is in the process of assigning email addresses, the city clerk said. So Olens is right. Not only are there counties and municipalities in Georgia that don’t have websites or whose elected officials don’t have government email. State organizations place their numbers at more than 200. Or, to put it differently, the cats of certain pet-obsessed owners have pounced across the digital divide well ahead of scores of Georgia governments. Olens earns a True.

pomt-05820	Says Texas legislators in 2011 increased state spending on education.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2012/feb/20/myra-crownover/myra-crownover-says-2011-legislature-increased-sta/	In a letter to constituents, state Rep. Myra Crownover strikes a familiar Republican chord by suggesting the 2011 Legislature dealt with tough times without shorting Texas public schools. Crownover’s message, which a reader pointed out to us on her campaign website in January 2012, says: "Most importantly, we balanced the state's budget with the first overall decrease in state spending in 50 years. We also were able to increase state spending on Education by $1.6 Billion even in the face of the worst recession in decades." We wondered if Crownover, R-Denton, was right about state education aid going up while the Republican-majority Legislature balanced the 2012-13 budget without a tax increase. That’s proved a common refrain from some Republicans including Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, who presides over the Senate. Crownover’s chief of staff, Kevin Cruser, provided a statement from Crownover pointing out that lawmakers last year wrote the budget after learning the state would reap $27 billion less in tax revenue over the two years than it would need to maintain "current services" spending, which takes into account the impact of growing demands in major funding areas including education, health and human services and employee benefits, according to the December 2011 "Fiscal Size-up" report by the nonpartisan Legislative Budget Board. Crownover’s statement further says schools were asked to tighten their belts and that federal funding available for the education part of the budget decreased significantly. "The Legislature did the best it could to lessen the impact of the recession and the decreased federal funding for public schools," her statement says, which the note says lawmakers could not cover. "In House Bill 1 (the budget act), General Revenue appropriations to the Foundation School Program increased by $1.6 billion over the previous biennium. General Revenue," Crownover notes, "is the term for state revenue that the Legislature has direct control over, and the Foundation School Program represents the most direct source of state revenue to our public schools." By law, the foundation program’s purpose is to guarantee that each school district has adequate resources to provide each student a basic instructional program and facilities. Also, each district is guaranteed access to substantially equalized financing for additional needs. Crownover’s statement also says the Legislature could not fund costs associated with rapid projected growth in the student population. After mentioning the $1.6 billion increase a second time, her statement says legislators did their best to prioritize schoolchildren. Clear sailing, then? Not for long. News accounts of legislative deliberations and budget board figures clarify that Crownover’s slightly-off recap of additional state revenue to the foundation program -- the bump proved to be $1.5 billion -- overlooks other spending decisions adding up to more than $5 billion in state-driven education budget reductions. In a way, this claim is a reminder that touting only one part of a budget can be deceptive. Let’s cover what legislators did and said, starting with news reports. Lawmakers tied up loose ends in the 2012-13 budget in a June 2011 special session. Key to Crownover’s claim: Members voted largely along party lines to approve a $2 billion a year reduction in state aid to schools based on existing funding formulas. According to a June 19, 2011, Austin American-Statesman news article, such aid, triggered by expected changes in enrollment, demographics and local property values, had formed the baseline for state education funding for 60 years. In the June session, the Republican heads of respective House and Senate education panels each acknowledged the June action as a reduction to districts though also saying the cuts could have been worse. As the Senate acted, according to a June 4, 2011, news article in the San Antonio Express-News, Sen. Florence Shapiro of Plano said: "Nobody wants cuts. But we have to have them." And as the House followed suit, a June 11, 2011, news article in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram quoted Rep. Rob Eissler of The Woodlands saying the overall net decrease to districts would average 4 to 5 percent, which he called "not that big a cut." Legislative Budget Board analyses of the budget reveal other ways that lawmakers reduced education aid. Board staffers summarized the yet-to-be finalized budget in May 2011 by saying the foundation program’s total funding, counting federal aid, would be reduced by $1.8 billion, a figure later adjusted to $1.9 billion based on actions in the June special session, according to the 2011 "Fiscal Size-up" report. This occurred, in part, due to federal aid to the foundation program dropping $2.8 billion, according to the May 2011 budget summary. In contrast, lawmakers in 2009 had the luxury of applying $3.3 billion in one-time federal stimulus aid to the public education part of the state budget, helping to cover a projected shortfall in state revenue. Congress did not send fresh stimulus money to the states in 2011. Summing up foundation program funding challenges, the 2011 "Fiscal Size-up" report says the 2011 Legislature was faced both with making up for the loss of the federal stimulus dollars that went to education in the previous budget plus $2.2 billion in costs to school districts to accommodate annual enrollment growth of 78,000 students through the 2012-13 school year. In addition, the report says, legislators had to address an estimated $2.3 billion needed to balance out past under-payments to districts for various reasons. And how did lawmakers confront those demands? They put $1.5 billion more in state revenue into the foundation program, as Crownover notes. Otherwise, the report shows, the Legislature did not cover costs of the projected enrollment increases and postponed a regular distribution of state aid to schools for 2012-13 into fiscal 2014, likely meaning the budget to be written by the 2013 Legislature. In addition, the May board summary shows that schools took another hit due to $1.4 billion in legislated reductions in funding for programs outside the foundation program. That 53 percent reduction, the summary says, diminished teacher incentive pay and dropout prevention funding and zeroed out grants to the pre-Kindergarten Early Start program. In a telephone interview, board staff spokesman John Barton told us lawmakers trimmed the reduction to $1.3 billion in their June special session. Our ruling Crownover’s statement focuses on one stream of public school funding. But other legislative decisions resulted in funding reductions to Texas schools more than twice as great as her touted increase. Overall funding to the foundation program went down. So, lawmakers ultimately cut public school aid, with key leaders even acknowledging so as those decisions were sealed. To tell constituents otherwise is not only inaccurate, it’s misleading and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!	None	Myra Crownover	None	None	None	2012-02-20T06:00:00	2012-01-30	['None']
pomt-10228	"My opponent promises to bring back old jobs by wishing away the global economy."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/04/john-mccain/obama-talks-often-about-the-global-economy-&mdash-/	In his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minn., Sen. John McCain alleged that Sen. Barack Obama's plan to create jobs amounted to "wishing away the global economy." The accusation came as McCain was talking about how he would approach today's troubled economy. "I know some of you have been left behind in the changing economy and it often seems your government hasn't even noticed," McCain said in the Sept. 4, 2008 speech. "Government assistance for unemployed workers was designed for the economy of the 1950s. That's going to change on my watch. My opponent promises to bring back old jobs by wishing away the global economy. We're going to help workers who've lost a job that won't come back, find a new one that won't go away." So where's the evidence that Obama wishes away the global economy? "He opposes free trade deals, threatens to unilaterally renegotiate NAFTA, playing on peoples' fear of free trade — wishing away the global economy," McCain spokesman Brian Rogers told us in an email exchange. "It's pretty straightforward." But it's not actually that straightforward. There's heaps of evidence out there against the charge. Obama regularly speaks not about doing away with the global economy, but competing more effectively in it. In fact, Obama did so in his own acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Denver: "Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy." Here's Obama on August 1, 2008, in St. Petersburg, Fla.: "I refuse to accept that we cannot meet the challenges of our global economy." And later in that same speech: "We can provide every child with a quality education so they have the skills to succeed in our global economy." And on July 31, 2008 in Iowa: "And we'll help American manufacturers — particularly in the auto industry — convert to green technology, and help workers learn the skills they need to stay ahead in the global economy." And on June 16, 2008 in Michigan: "Almost a decade into this century, we still have no real strategy to compete in a global economy." And on and on and on. That doesn't sound to us like someone intent on wishing away the global economy. You may disagree with how Obama would approach the challenges of the global economy, but it's hard to argue that he's pretending it doesn't exist. It's true, as Rogers alluded to, that Obama's rhetoric on free trade is often less enthusiastic than McCain's. He has criticized aspects of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and frequently courted voters who feel left out of the global economy. For example, here's Obama speaking about trade policy in Berlin, Germany on July 24, 2008: "Trade has been a cornerstone of our growth and global development. But we will not be able to sustain this growth if it favors the few, and not the many. Together, we must forge trade that truly rewards the work that creates wealth, with meaningful protections for our people and our planet. This is the moment for trade that is free and fair for all." So yes, Obama is not the most die-hard free trader there ever was. But that's a far cry from promising to "bring back old jobs by wishing away the global economy." He promises quite the opposite — to make the country more competitive in the global economy — and does it quite frequently. We find McCain's charge to be False.

pomt-15309	"Four times, I said, he (John McCain) is a hero, but you know ... people choose selective pieces."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/19/donald-trump/trump-i-called-mccain-hero-four-times/	Donald Trump is facing intense bipartisan backlash after saying Vietnam War prisoner of war Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is "not a war hero," but an indignant Trump won’t apologize. Trump defended his latest provocation on ABC’s This Week, adding that McCain "has done nothing to help veterans" and suggesting the senator should actually apologize to him for insulting Trump supporters. When pressed by host Martha Raddatz, Trump complained that his critics are taking his comments out of context. "Four times, I said he is a hero," he said on July 19, citing a fact-check by journalist Sharyl Attkisson. "But you know … people choose little selective pieces. If you read what I say or watch what I say, which is even better, you’ll say that there was nothing wrong." We took Trump’s advice and put his statement in context. The backstory The McCain-Trump war of words started in a New Yorker article published July 16. Ryan Lizza asked McCain about Trump and his anti-immigration rally held last weekend in McCain’s home state. McCain, as the article notes, led efforts to push through comprehensive immigration reform and "has been at war with the far right in Arizona for years." "This performance with our friend out in Phoenix is very hurtful to me," McCain told Lizza, "Because what he did was he fired up the crazies." Trump couldn’t take this lying down and retaliated on Twitter: (For the record, McCain graduated 894th out of a class of 899.) When Trump attended a rally in Ames, Iowa, on July 18, Republican pollster Frank Luntz asked him if calling McCain "a dummy" was appropriate. Trump recounted his beef with McCain before questioning his status as war hero in a back and forth with Luntz. Here’s a transcript of their conversation: Trump: "(McCain) insulted me and he insulted everybody in that room. And I said somebody should run against John McCain, who has been, in my opinion, not so hot. And I supported him for president. I raised $1 million for him. That’s a lot of money. I supported him, he lost, he let us down. But he lost and I never liked him much after that 'cause I don’t like losers. But, but — Frank, Frank, let me get to it. Luntz: "He’s a war hero. He’s a war hero …" Trump: "He’s not a war hero ..." Luntz: "He’s war hero." Trump: "He is a war hero ..." Luntz: "Five and half years in a Vietnamese prison camp …" Trump: "He’s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured. So he’s a war hero …" Luntz: "Do you agree with that?" Trump: "He’s a war hero, because he was captured, okay? I believe, perhaps, he’s a war hero. But right now he said some very bad things about a lot of people. So what I said is John McCain, I disagree with him that these people aren’t crazy." Trump literally said McCain "is a war hero" five times, but always with strings attached. Twice, he was interrupted by Luntz before he could finish his sentence. Once, the statement was preceded by "I believe, perhaps." And the last two times, Trump added "because he was captured." He also, of course, started all this by saying McCain is "not a war hero." Experts told us these caveats change the meaning of the sentence entirely. " ‘He’s a war hero because he was captured’ implies that anybody who is captured is called a war hero, but there’s really nothing special about them," said Kathleen Kendall, who studies political campaign communication at the University of Maryland. McCain, whose war record has been the subject of false attacks before, was taken prisoner by the Vietcong when his plane was shot down in 1967. For five and a half years, he was tortured and held in solitary confinement amid attempts by the North Vietnamese to obtain information and false confessions, according to the Navy. As the son of an admiral, McCain was offered an early release but refused until POWs who had been at the camp for longer than him were let go. We’re not remarking on whether captivity is a marker of heroism, but Trump likely wasn’t either, says rhetoric scholar Paul Achter of the University of Richmond. "(Trump) appears to have thought it would be a funny aside to the question he was answering," he said. In short, Trump’s self-defense is flimsy at best. As for his accusation of critics cherry-picking his comments, experts say the pot is calling the kettle black. "He’s taking his own words out of context. That’s the offense he’s charging the media with," Kendall said. We reached out to the Trump campaign for a response but didn’t hear back. Our ruling Trump said, "Four times, I said (McCain) is a hero but you know … people choose selective pieces." Trump literally said McCain is a hero five times, but never without caveats. Once, he added "perhaps, I believe" before conceding the point. Twice, he was interrupted. And the last two times, Trump said, "He is a war hero because he was captured." In other words, Trump also chose "selective pieces" and misquoted himself. We rate his claim Mostly False.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2015-07-19T16:55:38	2015-07-19	['None']
pomt-06782	Says a Senate resolution would restore $140 in monthly general assistance payments and prevent people from committing crime.	pants on fire!	/new-jersey/statements/2011/aug/18/sandra-cunningham/sen-sandra-cunningham-claims-new-jersey-residents-/	During a July 11 debate about overriding a veto handed down by Gov. Chris Christie, state Sen. Sandra Cunningham made an impassioned speech about the consequences of eliminating monthly general assistance payments to New Jersey residents in need. The Hudson County Democrat was pushing to restore the $19.5 million that Christie cut from the state budget for the general assistance program. A part of the state’s welfare reform program, the general assistance program serves single persons and married couples without children. Cunningham, one of the sponsors of a resolution for that funding, strongly implied that the state budget for fiscal year 2012 cut the $140 monthly payments and that her resolution would restore that amount. She argued that taking away that money would lead individuals to turn to crime. The problem is that those monthly payments were no longer in jeopardy. PolitiFact New Jersey found that Cunningham was wrong to suggest the monthly payments were going down. In fact, the final state budget maintains general assistance payments at their previous levels. First, let’s look at how Cunningham made her case. "I know when you look at it, you say, ‘It’s $140 per month. What good does it do?’ A hundred-forty dollars per month, if you don’t have a job, if you are trying to keep a roof over your head and food in your stomach, is a great deal of money," Cunningham told her colleagues. "It’s absolutely necessary. "If we don’t help these people, these people will find a way to help themselves," Cunningham continued. "When we talk about urban area, and when we talk about impoverished people, we talk a lot about crime. Well, crime and poverty go together." Cunningham went on, "And in this particular case, if these people cannot find, cannot have something to eat, they will take to the streets and they will commit a crime. They will do that." Before concluding her speech, Cunningham pleaded with her fellow senators: "Please think about how some of our people really need it and how some of our people in this state are forced to live. Please vote for this resolution." The resolution to provide that funding failed in a 24-15 vote. Now, let’s explain the general assistance payments. In fiscal year 2011, the general assistance program provided monthly benefits of $140 and $210 for recipients deemed "employable" and "unemployable," respectively. The fiscal year 2012 budget proposed by Gov. Chris Christie included language to cut monthly benefits by $15. But the Legislature threw out that language when it approved the budget and Christie could not add it back in. David Rosen, legislative budget and finance officer for the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, confirmed that removing that language from the governor’s proposed budget maintained the monthly benefit levels and the governor could not restore that language. Nicole Brossoie, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Human Services, said in an email that the monthly benefits will remain unchanged in fiscal year 2012 because that language was eliminated. State funding for the general assistance program remains slightly below the fiscal year 2011 level, but that’s due to other program changes, Brossoie said. Of Cunningham’s resolution, Brossoie said, "No change would have been made to cash benefits." So, let’s be clear: Cunningham urged her colleagues to maintain $140 monthly payments that were not being cut. Cunningham told PolitiFact New Jersey that at the time she made the statement she believed the Senate resolution would restore the $15 cut to monthly payments. She later acknowledged that the monthly benefits have been restored to their prior levels, but declined to comment further. But what about Cunningham’s claim that losing general assistance payments could drive some recipients to commit crimes? Two experts said general assistance payments won’t necessarily prevent crime. "There is certainly a link between poverty and crime, but it’s not so simple that a small payment would fix it," said John Roman, executive director of the District of Columbia Crime Policy Institute. The ruling Cunningham strongly implied the state budget cut monthly general assistance payments, but the budget actually kept those payments intact. The senator also said losing that money could lead to more crime, but two experts said the payments wouldn’t necessarily prevent criminal acts. Cunningham acknowledged the monthly benefits were restored, but it is still ridiculous for her to claim people will commit crime in response to losing general assistance payments, when those payments aren’t changing at all.

pomt-11860	"We’re growing union jobs faster than Illinois."	true	/illinois/statements/2017/nov/03/eric-holcomb/indiana-governor-right-gloat-about-union-jobs-succ/	If you watched more than an inning of the 2017 World Series, you probably saw an unusual ad from the re-election campaign of Gov. Bruce Rauner. Titled "Thanks, Mike!," the 30-second spot features the governors of Missouri, Wisconsin and Indiana extolling the economic success of their states and "thanking" Rauner’s arch political rival, Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan, D-Chicago, for thwarting Rauner’s reform agenda during the Republican’s first term. Rauner doesn’t appear in the ad. Instead, Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb, all Republicans, look into the camera and boast of their states’ economic gains, which they attribute to policies enacted by Madigan ("raising Illinois’ taxes," says Walker) or prevented by him ("blocking Rauner’s reforms," says Greitens). The most specific claim comes from Holcomb of Indiana: "We’re growing union jobs faster than Illinois." Given Indiana’s status as a "right-to-work" state that bans compulsory union membership and Illinois’ status as one of the most union-friendly states in the nation, Holcomb’s statement invites a closer look. Union gap The Rauner campaign said Holcomb’s claim is based on a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report from January 2017 on union employment and membership. The report shows that from 2015 to 2016 -- the first two years Rauner was in office -- workers represented by unions in Indiana grew from 319,000 to 335,000, an increase of 5 percent. During that same time, workers represented by unions in Illinois fell by 4 percent, from 892,000 to 856,000. The difference between the two states is all the more striking when considered against Illinois’ longstanding reputation as a union stronghold. The report notes that Illinois is among a handful of states that account for most of the union membership in the nation: Over half of the 14.6 million union members in the U.S. lived in just 7 states (California, 2.6 million; New York, 1.9 million; Illinois, 0.8 million; Pennsylvania, 0.7 million; and Michigan, New Jersey, and Ohio, 0.6 million each), though these states accounted for only about one-third of wage and salary employment nationally. Trend tracking Illinois’ 2015-16 union numbers are no statistical fluke. Even before the Great Recession, Illinois had been losing union jobs at a faster clip than its neighbor to the east. From 2006-07, the number of workers represented by unions in Illinois fell from 979,000 to 884,000, a decrease of nearly 10 percent. Indiana’s union job losses in that period were less than 1 percent -- from 334,000 to 333,000. Michael Hicks, an economics professor at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., who tracks Midwest job trends, says the pattern bucks conventional wisdom. "In 2006-07, in the wake of the very difficult manufacturing employment period, Illinois and Indiana shed both public and private union jobs," Hicks said in an email. "But Indiana was holding on better, when it should not have because we are a more manufacturing intensive state (and private sector unions are more tied to manufacturing)." Greater Chicago’s large and diverse economy should have provided a buffer for the state’s overall jobs picture, but that hasn’t happened, Hicks said. "In the most recent data, Indiana is well outperforming Illinois in both private and public sector union job growth. Given the very large agglomeration economy that is Chicago, this should not be the case," Hicks said. Unemployment figures over the past decade also attest to Illinois’ job struggles relative to Indiana. While both hit peak unemployment in January 2010 -- Illinois at 11.2 percent, Indiana at 10.9 percent -- Indiana’s post-recession recovery has been significantly stronger. Indiana ended 2016 with 4 percent unemployment while Illinois was at 5.7 percent. The most recent figures, from September, have Indiana at 3.8 percent and Illinois at 5 percent. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Gratitude deserved? This leads to the big question about the ad: Does the speaker of the Illinois House -- who also happens to be chairman of the Democratic Party of Illinois -- deserve the thanks of Govs. Greitens, Walker and Holcomb? Have policies driven by a Democrat-led General Assembly caused Illinois’ economic woes? Hicks is neither dismissive nor completely accepting of the governors’ claims. "While I am not ready to say with scientific certainty that the budget and pension crises facing Illinois are the sole reason for lagging job growth," Hicks said, "the uncertainty about future tax rates and the risk of interrupted public services must surely be playing a role in Illinois’ poorer than expected economic performance in the post-recessionary period." Our ruling Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb said Indiana is "growing union jobs faster than Illinois." The latest report on union membership and representation from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics backs Holcomb’s claim, with Illinois losing 5 percent of its union jobs between 2015 and 2016 and Indiana gaining 4 percent. It’s a trend that predates the Great Recession and, in the bigger jobs picture, is backed by a decade’s worth of unemployment figures in the two states. We rate this statement True.

pomt-09574	"At the beginning of the last decade ... America had a budget surplus of over $200 billion. By the time I took office, we had a one-year deficit of over $1 trillion and projected deficits of $8 trillion over the next decade."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/27/barack-obama/obama-claims-us-budget-went-surplus-deficit-ten-ye/	A big part of President Barack Obama's first State of the Union speech on Jan. 27, 2010, focused on the economy. To set the stage, he said his predecessor was largely responsible for the country's fiscal shape. "At the beginning of the last decade ... America had a budget surplus of over $200 billion," Obama said. "By the time I took office, we had a one-year deficit of over $1 trillion and projected deficits of $8 trillion over the next decade. Most of this was the result of not paying for two wars, two tax cuts, and an expensive prescription drug program." We've checked several claims to this effect in the last year, most recently one by Obama adviser David Axelrod. Indeed, we found that the government was enjoying a surplus of about $236 billion circa 2001. Later, when Obama took office, the Congressional Budget Office reported the deficit was over $1.2 trillion. A good chunk of the deficits racked up by the Bush administration came from tax cuts, the war in Iraq and actions that Bush and a Democratic Congress took to prop up the economy right before he left office. In the same report, the CBO projected a 10-year deficit of about $3.1 trillion. But Obama said $8 trillion, based on budget numbers published by the White House Office of Management and Budget shortly after Obama took office. Why the discrepancy? When we checked the similar claim by Axelrod, we spoke with Josh Gordon, policy director for the Concord Coalition. He said it has to do with how the two offices estimate the future. The CBO bases its projections on the assumption that the Bush tax cuts would expire in 2010 and that a patch to fix the alternative minimum tax would expire, among other things. The White House does not; instead, it assumes that nothing changes in current law. So, Obama's overall point is correct that the government was enjoying a substantial surplus when Bush took office and had a big deficit when he departed; he's spot on about the surplus Bush began with. He's also correct about the deficit at the end of Bush's presidency, but there are two different ways to measure the 10-year projection when Bush left office. The CBO's estimate is $5 trillion lower than the White House numbers, though economists don't quibble with the White House methodology. So given that discussion, we'll take Obama down a notch to Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2010-01-27T23:35:57	2010-01-27	['None']
pomt-07932	"We're borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/27/kent-conrad/kent-conrad-said-were-borrowing-40-cents-every-dol/	Government borrowing needs to be brought back under control, and the solutions are not easy, said Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., on This Week with Christiane Amanpour. "The American people say, don't touch Social Security, don't touch Medicare, don't cut defense," Conrad said. "That's 84 percent of the federal budget. If you can't touch 84 percent of the federal budget -- and, by the way, they also don't want to touch revenue -- you're down to 16 percent of the budget at a time we're borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend. "So, you know, there needs to be leadership to help the American people understand how serious this problem is and that it's going to take a lot more than cutting foreign aid and taxing the rich. You're not going to solve the problem that way." Conrad was one of three senators who appeared on This Week to discuss bipartisanship. Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, also appeared. All three have announced they intend to retire in 2012. We wanted to check Conrad's statement that "we're borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend." We looked at whether Social Security, Medicare and defense constituted 84 percent of the federal budget in a different fact-check. We turned to the U.S. Treasury Department's Monthly Treasury Statement of Receipts and Outlays of the United States Government. For the most recently completed fiscal year, 2010, the department reported that the government had revenues of $2.16 trillion, spending of $3.46 trillion and a deficit of $1.29 trillion. Divide the deficit by the outlays and you get 37 percent, which is very close to 40 percent. We initially found the numbers a little confusing, but one of the experts we interviewed for this story explained it this way: "It's like a family that earns $60,000 per year, but is spending $100,000. How are they doing it? By getting a new $40,000 loan every year to cover the difference," said Brian Riedl, a budget expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation. In rating Conrad's statement, we find he correctly described how much the government is borrowing in comparison with what it's spending. We rate his statement True.

pomt-08575	On Lee Fisher’s watch, "almost nine out of 10" jobs that Ohio lost were lost to other states, "not to other countries."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2010/sep/27/rob-portman/portman-raps-lee-fisher-and-administration-saying-/	Rob Portman makes a unique bogeyman for his opponent : He’s a Republican who not only supported foreign trade policies, which his foes blame for Ohio job losses, but he also personally advised a president on expanding trade. He personifies the policy. Yet Portman, a Republican running for U.S. Senate, has a uniquely good comeback. He says that while many companies have survived thanks to the export opportunities of foreign trade, Ohio lost lots of other jobs to other states on the watch of his opponent, Lee Fisher -- the irony being that Fisher, a Democrat and Ohio’s lieutenant governor, was also Ohio’s development director, in charge of bringing new jobs to the state. It’s a blame game with resumes perfectly tailored for the respective attacks. But who’s more to blame for Ohio’s job losses? The guy who promoted trade with China and Mexico and saw jobs cross those borders? Or the guy who as Ohio development director saw too much development cross state borders, not international ones? Portman, appearing with Fisher before The Plain Dealer editorial board on Sept. 14, said that if you want to compare the validity of these opposing claims, data from the state backs up his: more jobs went to other states than went abroad. "It may surprise you to learn that when you look at the state’s own data in terms of job loss, that almost nine out of 10 jobs we have lost in the last three and a half years during the Strickland-Fisher administration have gone to other states, not to other countries," Portman said, referring to Fisher and Gov. Ted Strickland. "Think about that. So companies have left Cleveland to go to Indiana. Companies have left Cleveland to go across the border to Michigan. And yet it’s easy in a campaign to fan the flames of protectionism" and to claim that the jobs went to "Mexico or Canada or, more likely, China." We asked about that data, went to the state’s website to see for ourselves, and laid it out in an Excel file. What we saw, however, were alternate versions of the same reality -- one that supports Portman and yet simultaneously presents as many holes as aged Emmental cheese. So before we put this to the Truth-O-Meter, let us show you the numbers, starting with Portman’s view of them. The "state’s own data" comes from the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services, or ODJFS. In concert with the U.S. Department of Labor, ODJFS publishes quarterly reports of "Mass Layoff Events," based on surveys of companies with 50 or more initial unemployment claims filed within a five-week period. The surveys, conducted by telephone, ask why the layoffs occurred and whether they were associated with jobs being moved from one place to another. If so, the survey asks where these jobs went: Somewhere else in Ohio? Some other state? Some other country? Reviewing these quarterly reports, we found missing numbers and an error the state had made. After we discussed this with ODJFS, the agency went back and updated one quarterly set of numbers. That changed the outcome of the tally, but only slightly. Because Portman relied on the old data, we will still use the old data to evaluate his claim. From January 2007 through March of 2010, 842 jobs were lost in Ohio because companies moved operations overseas, the old reports showed. That’s a small number compared with the 5,215 jobs lost in Ohio because companies moved their operations to other states, as the state data showed. Put another way, it means that of the jobs that left Ohio, only 13.9 percent went overseas -- and 86 percent went to other states. Now consider Portman’s words: The state’s "own data" shows that "almost nine out of ten jobs we have lost in the last three and a half years during the Strickland-Fisher administration have gone to other states, not to other countries." Eighty-six percent is close enough to nine out of ten. So Portman is right -- yes? Well, yes -- except for the caveats. Let’s start with those from the state. ODJFS quarterly reports note that employers with fewer than 50 workers are not part of the surveys, so these numbers do not include small companies. That exclusion partly explains why the total number of lost jobs counted in these Ohio quarterly reports -- 264,016 since January 2007, including the vast majority that had little to do with the movement of work -- is lower than you’ll see in other reports of job losses. Then there’s the U.S. Department of Labor, whose Bureau of Labor Statistics sets the survey standards and points out that "movement of work" is defined as work that will be performed by a company or for a company in a new location. Movement is easy to report when a company shutters one plant and reopens another, whether in Juarez, Mexico, or Kokomo, Ind. The definition also applies if a company signs a contract to have its widgets manufactured in Shanghai, China. These are hypothetical examples, because the state reports do not give the exact place of relocation. But if a large company with a big supply chain starts using a widget supplier in Mexico and stops buying from a supplier in Ohio, and that Ohio supplier loses so much revenue that it shuts down, those lost jobs are not counted in the "movement of work" column. Those jobs, then, do not wind up in Portman’s comparison. That’s the biggest problem. We asked Policy Matters Ohio, a think tank, for its latest report on trade adjustment assistance, or TAA, a federal assistance program for workers displaced because of foreign trade. In 2009, 20,677 Ohio workers were deemed potentially eligible for the program, and 9,455 more were in 2008, according to TAA certification reports reviewed by Policy Matters. That suggests that job losses from trade were massively higher than those attributable to companies moving out of state. But some of those workers eligible for TAA wound up keeping their jobs or getting rehired, such as when General Motors’ Lordstown plant began rehiring. Others found work elsewhere; a precise number does not exist, which presents a problem for all of these comparisons. Everyone is talking about fruit, but they’re often comparing apples with persimmons. PolitiFact Ohio has previously examined claims by Strickland and Fisher that trade deals cost specific numbers of job losses in Ohio. We have found trend lines that appear believable, but the reports and statistics the officials cite rely on extrapolations or suppositions. Someday the comparative data may exist; until then, each side in this debate simply argues a point that sounds as if it could be true -- and certainly rings true to those affected -- but that lacks the accuracy that advocates suggest when they trot out their numbers. So we return to Portman’s claim. Portman’s spokeswoman, Jessica Towhey, says the candidate made clear that he was referring solely to state data and the movement of jobs out of state, compared with those moved out of the country, when he said that nine out of 10 jobs lost in Ohio went to other states, not other countries. In such a narrow construct, Portman’s statement might be considered accurate but there is more to this picture. Here are the numbers as updated: From Jan. 1, 2007, through March 31, 2010, Ohio lost 4,820 jobs due to company moves out of state (not the 5,215 in the reports that existed when Portman viewed them). It lost 1,125 more when companies closed operations in one part of the state but relocated elsewhere in Ohio. And it lost 842 jobs when companies moved operations abroad. This is out of 264,016 jobs counted as lost altogether in this particular series of reports -- reports that ODJFS spokesman Ben Johnson say capture just "a subset" of all layoffs. When a statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, the Truth-O-Meter says it is mostly true. That’s how we find Portman’s claim: accurate in a narrow context but needing clarification, and so, Mostly True.	None	Rob Portman	None	None	None	2010-09-27T13:10:00	2010-09-14	['Ohio']
pomt-13403	Says a change in law he carried stopped a $100 million tax increase in the Dallas school district.	true	/texas/statements/2016/sep/23/paul-bettencourt/paul-bettencourt-says-voting-threshold-he-champion/	For almost any elected official, a $100 million item funded by taxpayer money is a big deal. So we sat up when state Sen. Paul Bettencourt, R-Houston, took credit for stopping such a Dallas tax hike. Bettencourt said in an Aug. 24, 2016, press release: "Stopping a $100 million... tax increase will be a record that will stand for some time." We wondered if indeed a Bettencourt-backed change in law stopped the described hike. Bettencourt, who chairs the Senate Select Committee on Property Tax Reform and Relief, said that during the 2015 legislative session, he offered a revision to a measure authored by state Sen. Brandon Creighton, R-Conroe. The adopted tweak, Bettencourt said, imposed a higher voting threshold for "local taxing units to assess property tax increases in their jurisdictions." And, the release indicated, the Dallas school board recently failed to approve the described tax hike because advocates didn’t clear the higher threshold. We checked: In 2015, Creighton authored and Bettencourt amended Senate Bill 1760, which was signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott on June 15, 2015, and became law on Jan. 1, 2016. The Texas Association of School Boards spells out how a tax ratification election, or TRE, works: "Texas law requires school districts to calculate two taxes rates -- the effective tax rate and the rollback tax rate... Generally, if a school board adopts a tax rate above its rollback tax rate, it must hold an election to ratify that rate." The TASB guidance continues: "If a majority of the votes cast in the election favor the proposition to approve the rate, then the tax rate for the current year is adopted by the board. If the proposition is not approved, the board may not adopt a rate higher than the rollback rate." But before the question can get to voters, thanks to the new state law, it takes a 60 percent vote from the school board to put it on a ballot. Voter may then approve the tax increase with a majority vote in an election. Through 2015, state law required a simple majority vote of the school board and voters alike. Upshot: Local taxing authorities must secure a supermajority vote, or 60 percent, whereas to adopt a new tax rate higher than its rollback tax rate. Through 2015, state law required only a majority vote of a local board. So, what exactly happened in Dallas? On Aug. 19, 2016, the nine-member Dallas Independent School Board voted on whether to ask Dallas County residents to consider a 13-cent property tax increase, which supporters said would raise about $104 million to fund early childhood education programs and other initiatives in the district. According to a briefing the trustees received that month, the estimated $104 million would have been spent three ways: -- $40 million for expanding access to early childhood education, including full-day pre-kindergarten -- $32 million for teacher compensation -- $32 million for expanding college preparation programs at district high schools After the vote, some board members said they remained committed to finding the money elsewhere in the district’s budget. "Our hope is to do our best with the money that we have to expand all three of those programs, but that’s a challenge given that there was $105 million on the table with the TRE that we won’t have access to this year," board member Dustin Miller said after the vote. "We’ll be looking for possible cuts in other areas in order to free up money to fund those programs." Five trustees voted to put the question on the November 2016 ballot, called a tax ratification election, and four trustees voted against it. The 5-4 vote did not meet the supermajority threshold, per the new law. Residents of Dallas ISD will not see the tax increase question on their ballots in November, and several trustees have said they will go back to the drawing board. Miguel Solis, a board member who voted to send the measure to voters, said the new threshold was single-handedly responsible for killing the TRE idea. Voters likely would have approved the tax increase, though it would have been a tight race, he said. "We discussed (before the board’s vote) whether or not we would be able to pass this thing," Solis told us by phone. Todd Williams, executive director of Commit! Partnership, said the Dallas district is the only one in North Texas not to achieve the requisite supermajority vote needed under the revised law. He leads a consortium of area business, nonprofits, school districts and foundations who focus on local education issues and who supported the TRE. "In the Dallas County area, we’ve seen several districts go for a TRE," he said. "(Commit! Partnership) polled it and it looked like, after we informed voters of the structure and the outcomes, it was going to win about 58 or 59 percent." Also in August 2016, voters in Frisco rejected a similar 13-cent tax increase in a tax ratification election, but in that case, the school board had a super-majority to send the question to voters. According to a WFAA-TV news story, much of the new revenue would have covered an increase in teacher pay and helped address an estimated $30 million shortfall in the district’s 2017-18 budget. Since the law took effect, 33 of the state’s more than 1,000 school boards have cleared the higher hurdle set in place at Bettencourt’s urging and sent the question of a tax increase to voters, according to the education website TexasISD.com. In all but three of those instances -- in the Yantis, Marlin, and Frisco districts -- voters went on to approve the proposed hike, the website said. Our ruling Bettencourt said a change in law he carried stopped a $100 million tax increase in the Dallas school district. You bet your calculator it did though it’s also so that more than 30 other school boards cleared the higher threshold singled out by Bettencourt, each time sending a tax-hike proposal to voters.

pomt-12612	"Colorado Rockies baseball team to sell marijuana brownies at their concession stands."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/apr/02/empiresportsco/fake-story-colorado-rockies-will-sell-pot-brownies/	A years-old fake news post about a Major League baseball club selling way more than Cracker Jack continues to burn readers who may be eager to partake of pot in the grandstand. The headline on an EmpireSports.co story dated Feb. 28, 2014, says it all: "Colorado Rockies baseball team to sell marijuana brownies at their concession stands." Except the team is doing no such thing, even though Colorado residents voted to decriminalize recreational marijuana in 2012. You might actually have to go outside Coors Field almost two entire city blocks or so to find recreational marijuana edibles, instead. PolitiFact Colorado examined the origins of this claim as part of the inaugural International Fact-Checking Day, April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.org describe the day as "not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts -- and fact-checking -- in politics, journalism, and everyday life." It’s anyone’s guess why this story continues to live on (we have some theories), but it has. It also was flagged by Facebook users as being fake. The disclaimer from EmpireSports.co, which is now defunct and hasn’t posted a new sports story in a couple of years, notes it is "a satirical and entertainment website" that fabricates content. Another page labeled "About Us" further notes that "sometimes we report things we just WISH would happen." There also hasn’t been any activity on EmpireSports.co’s Facebook or Twitter accounts since 2015. The home page does link to EmpireNews.net, a separate website that fabricates news stories and is still up and running. The owner of both sides, Aaron Smith, confirmed to us that all its new sports stories are now also posted on EmpireNews.net. Smith didn’t know why his three-year-old Rockies story was still being shared as if it were recent, but he said he hadn’t noticed any appreciable increase in hits recently.

pomt-11816	"Breaking! Roy Moore’s accuser worked for Democratic leaders and is actively campaigning for Moore’s opponent."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2017/nov/15/activist-mommy/headline-misleads-tying-roy-moore-accuser-democrat/	In response to the Washington Post article about Republican Alabama U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore having relationships with teenage girls in the past, some articles surfaced accusing one of the women of having political motivations. The conservative website Activist Mommy said that Deborah Wesson Gibson, who said Moore solicited dates from her when she was a teenager and he was in his 30s, has worked for national Democrats. The website also said that Gibson is supporting Doug Jones, the Democrat running against Moore in the Dec 12 special election. (Gibson told the Post that she was 17 when Moore asked her out on dates that did not progress beyond kissing.) "Breaking! Roy Moore’s accuser worked for Democratic leaders and is actively campaigning for Moore’s opponent," states the headline Nov. 10. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially misleading, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The Activist Mommy story states that Gibson "is not only a passionate progressive, but she has actually worked for the DNC and is actively campaigning for Moore’s opponent, Doug Jones. .... social media evidence makes clear that she is a fervent supporter of Jones and Democrats in general, and has even worked for the DNC." The website states that Gibson is a sign language interpreter who has interpreted at rallies for former Vice President Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton. We found more details in a report from the Alabama Media Group, AL.com, which stated that Gibson owns an interpreting company, Signs of Excellence, and linked to photos posted on its Facebook page showing her interpreting for Clinton as well as Biden. Fox News showed additional photos on Signs of Excellence’s Facebook page that included Gibson interpreting for U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy’s 2016 Senate bid and appearing with U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, both Florida Democrats. Reached at her Signs of Excellence business phone number in Florida on Nov. 13, Gibson declined to comment. Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Sabrina Singh told PolitiFact that Gibson and her company never received payment from the DNC. The Activist Mommy website shows only a little information linking Gibson to Jones, the Democrat running against Moore. But the information doesn’t show Gibson actively campaigning for him. The site shows Gibson shared a Sept. 20 statement on Facebook by Jones’ campaign announcing that Biden would appear on his behalf. "I was honored to interpret for Vice President Biden in the fall of 2012!" she wrote in a comment, including a photo of her alongside Biden. The website also showed that she shared a story by New York Magazine stating that Democrats have a chance to beat Moore. Gibson, a Delray Beach, Fla., resident, is a long-time registered Republican voter in Palm Beach County. She initially registered without any party affiliation in April 1995 and then switched her registration to Republican in December 1995, according to Susan Bucher, the Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections. She has since remained registered as a Republican. Gibson voted in the presidential preference primary in March 2016 and in the general election in November 2016. We emailed the Activist Mommy, Elizabeth Johnston, and told her that we didn’t see evidence on her website that Gibson was actively campaigning for Jones. She did not provide additional evidence to bolster her claim. Sebastian Kitchen, a spokesman for Jones’ campaign, told PolitiFact that Gibson has played no role in Jones’ campaign. "Her name is nowhere in our volunteer database, we have no indication she ever contributed," he says. "We have no evidence whatsoever that she had anything to do with our campaign." Our ruling The Activist Mommy website states in a headline "Breaking! Roy Moore’s accuser worked for Democratic leaders and is actively campaigning for Moore’s opponent." The website is referring to Deborah Wesson Gibson, who owns a sign language interpretation company. The company’s Facebook photos show that Gibson has interpreted speeches for Democrats including Hillary Clinton and Biden. The website also states that Gibson worked for the DNC; however, a spokeswoman for the DNC says that it never paid Gibson or her firm. The article’s evidence is weak to link Gibson to Jones. Two Facebook shares do not prove that Gibson is actively campaigning for Jones, and the campaign says she has played no role. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-01233	The climate-change agreement between the United States and China "requires the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 years."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/nov/19/mitch-mcconnell/mitch-mcconnell-says-us-china-climate-deal-means-c/	During a recent visit to China, President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced a potentially landmark climate change agreement between the two countries, which are among the world’s biggest economies and biggest emitters of greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases, and notably carbon dioxide, are produced when burning fossil fuels such as coal and oil for energy. When these gases build up in the atmosphere, most scientists say, they trap heat and raise surface temperatures, leading to changes in climate such as climbing sea levels. For years, one of the key arguments made by opponents of U.S. efforts to cut carbon emissions has been that rising emissions from other big and fast-growing economies, such as China, could swamp any reductions the United States makes. The agreement with China potentially weakens that argument. But congressional Republicans, including incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., weren’t pleased with the terms of the accord. McConnell, who represents a coal-producing state, said so on Nov. 12, 2014, while talking to reporters covering a meeting with newly elected members of his Republican conference. "The president continues to send a signal that he has no intention of moving toward the middle," McConnell said. "I was particularly distressed by the deal he’s reached with the Chinese on his current trip, which, as I read the agreement, it requires the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 years, while these carbon emission regulations are creating havoc in my state and other states across the country." Several readers asked us to check whether McConnell is right that the bilateral agreement "requires the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 years." We turned to the announcement released by the White House on Nov. 12. Here’s the relevant portion: "Today, the presidents of the United States and China announced their respective post-2020 actions on climate change, recognizing that these actions are part of the longer range effort to transition to low-carbon economies, mindful of the global temperature goal of 2℃. The United States intends to achieve an economy-wide target of reducing its emissions by 26%-28% below its 2005 level in 2025 and to make best efforts to reduce its emissions by 28%. China intends to achieve the peaking of CO2 emissions around 2030 and to make best efforts to peak early and intends to increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 20% by 2030. Both sides intend to continue to work to increase ambition over time." Boiled down, the key tasks for China in this deal are: 1.) an intention to max out carbon dioxide emissions around 2030, if not sooner, and; 2.) an intention to increase to about 20 percent the proportion of non-fossil fuels, such as renewables, in China’s energy mix. When we asked for backup on his claims, McConnell’s office made two reasonable points. First, his office noted that the agreement is based on intentions, rather than on ironclad promises with enforcement mechanisms. They pointed to a column by Robert A. Manning, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, an international-affairs think tank, and a veteran of President George W. Bush’s State Department. Manning wrote that "this is not a binding agreement and includes no benchmarks to measure progress or penalties to encourage it." The second point McConnell’s office makes is that China may already have been planning to make these emissions cuts anyway. According to a report in Reuters, the 2030 peak date was "in line with forecasts already made by several state-backed think-tanks, with the China Academy of Social Sciences saying in a study last week that slowing rates of urbanization would likely mean that industrial emissions would peak around 2025-2030 and start to fall by 2040." In theory, China could "simply shut down a lot of plants on Dec. 31, 2029," Jonathan R. Nash, a law professor at Emory University, told PolitiFact. "In that case, the agreement itself doesn't obligate China to take action before 2030." Experts said this is theoretically possible, but, in the real world, unlikely. It will take "significant work" for China to reach the 2030 target, said Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor at UCLA. "You can't stop your emissions immediately. Imagine if China said they would stop emissions today. That would require massive changes to implement -- no increases in driving unless cars were cleaner, no new economic growth without cutting emissions elsewhere, and so on. For China to achieve a cap in emissions by 2030, they will have to begin to find clean energy replacements very soon or seriously limit economic growth." Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University, agreed. "Given the inertia in the economic and energy systems of China and its recent rates of emissions growth, there is absolutely no way that could happen without … an earlier slowing of emissions growth," he said. "No sensible policy would allow" any different course, he said. But as questionable as it is to suggest that China could do nothing until Dec. 31, 2029, and still meet the targets, there’s still a second task for China -- to increase non-fossil fuels to about 20 percent of the nation’s energy mix by 2030. Because no such infrastructure can be created overnight, China will have to start work on this part well before December 2029. Indeed, such efforts already appear to be under way, said Michael B. Gerrard, a law professor at Columbia University who has studied the issue. "China is engaged in a massive program of building wind, solar and nuclear energy plants," he said. Our ruling McConnell said the climate-change agreement between the United States and China "requires the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 years." McConnell’s staff has a point that the agreement isn’t binding and may simply be codifying changes China had already planned to make. Still, his claim is at best an exaggeration. While it’s theoretically possible that China could meet its emissions target simply by shutting down major plants on Dec. 31, 2029, experts say it would be much less risky to China’s economy to spend the next 16 years working toward the goal, rather than doing it overnight. But even if China did choose to make a literal overnight shift on emissions, that still doesn’t account for China’s pledge to increase non-fossil-fuel use to 20 percent of its energy mix. Building that infrastructure cannot be done overnight and will take years to carry out, experts said. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-05330	On support for gay marriage.	no flip	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/15/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-has-maintained-consistent-stance-same/	With President Barack Obama's change of position on gay marriage -- which earned a Full Flop on our Flip-O-Meter -- we thought it was a good time to take a fresh look at Mitt Romney's position on the same issue. Shortly after Obama’s announcement, Romney was pressed about his own stance on same-sex marriage. In each case, he offered similar answers. At a campaign event in Oklahoma City, reporters asked Romney to clarify his position. "My view is that marriage itself is a relationship between a man and a woman. That’s my own preference, and I know other people have differing views. This is a very tender and sensitive topic," he said. Romney added that he believes states should be able to decide whether to offer certain legal rights to same-sex couples, according to the Associated Press. Later, Romney told KETV-TV in Omaha that,"as a society, I think we’re better off if we encourage the establishment of homes with a mother and a father." Same-sex marriage, he said, isn’t "appropriate and needed for a strong society." Meanwhile, in an interview with KDVR-TV in Denver, Romney said, "I don't favor civil unions if they are identical to marriage other than by name. My view is that domestic partnership benefits, hospital visitation rights and the like are appropriate, but the others are not." Finally, in a commencement address at Liberty University on May 12, Romney said that American values, "may become topics of democratic debate from time to time. So it is today with the enduring institution of marriage. Marriage is a relationship between one man and one woman." We wondered whether the opposition to same-sex marriage that Romney offered in the wake of Obama’s announcement represented a change in views. So we put it to the Flip-O-Meter. We’ll start by noting that the Flip-O-Meter rates politicians' consistency on particular topics from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on their decisions to change their minds. It’s simply gauging whether they did. As we wrote in 2007, Romney took a relatively liberal approach on gay rights during his 1994 Senate race against liberal Democratic icon Edward M. Kennedy. During his Senate race, Romney wrote a letter to the Massachusetts branch of the Log Cabin Republicans, which read in part, "I am more convinced than ever before that as we seek to establish full equality for America's gay and lesbian citizens, I will provide more effective leadership than my opponent." He promised the group that he would support laws preventing discrimination against gays and lesbians in the workplace and implied his hope for the eventual full integration of gays in the military, a policy that was ultimately approved 16 years later. A lengthy interview with Romney in Bay Windows, a Boston-area gay newspaper, was headlined, "Romney: I'll be better than Ted for gay rights." But despite making policy overtures to gay voters, Romney consistently drew the line at gay marriage, even as far back as 1994. When Romney was asked by Bay Windows, "Would you support legalized marriage for gay men and lesbians?" Romney responded, "I line up with (moderate Massachusetts Republican Gov. William) Weld on that, and it's a state issue as you know -- the authorization of marriage on a same-sex basis falls under state jurisdiction. My understanding is that he has looked at the issue and concluded that certain benefits and privileges should be offered to gay couples and lesbian couples. But he does not feel at this time that he wishes to extend legalized marriage on a same-sex basis, and I support his position." Then, in 2003, when the Massachusetts Supreme Court opened the doors to same-sex marriage in the state, Romney supported a constitutional amendment that would have banned the practice. Romney maintained his opposition to same-sex marriage during the 2008 Republican presidential primary campaign, saying at one Iowa event that he’s fought same-sex marriage "every way I have known how to, and the fight isn’t over," according to the New York Times. Our ruling In a Sept. 14, 2007 interview on MSNBC, Romney said, "I have not changed my position on the marriage amendment or anything else related to marriage." We have found nothing to contradict this view. While Romney in 1994 offered relatively liberal views on some policies of importance to gay voters, he never went so far as to support same-sex marriage. In fact, he spoke out against the idea -- and took actions to stem it while governor. Romney has been consistent on this. No Flip.

pomt-00608	"The American murder rate is 50 times that of any other developed nation."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/jun/02/russell-brand/russell-brand-misinforms-fans-about-us-murder-rate/	In 2014, eccentric British comedian Russell Brand launched an Internet video show called The Trews, short for "true news." True news! Something PunditFact can get behind. The show usually features Brand offering his opinion on the topics of the day, often about his native England but also sometimes about the United States. In the 327th episode of The Trews, Brand criticizes Fox News pundit Greg Gutfeld for cheering the death sentence for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, convicted for his role in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings that killed three people and injured scores more. Brand said Gutfeld and other Fox News pundits ignore the prevalence of gun violence in the United States that kills a lot more people, throwing out a slew of statistics to capture his point. "In a country that has more guns per person than any other country in the world, where the American murder rate is 50 times that of any other developed nation, where women are estimated to be 11 times more likely to be murdered with a gun than women in any other developed country, why does the focus fall on this particular story?" Brand said. "Because it’s a story that helps to maintain the order." Brand’s soliloquy continued after his round of fact-dropping, but the show being called The Trews and all, we were struck by the claim that the U.S. murder rate "is 50 times that of any other developed nation." Unfortunately, it’s not Trews. "Fifty times is ridiculous," said James Alan Fox, Northeastern University professor of criminology, law and public policy. "Fifty times the homicide rate is much too high," said David Hemenway, a Harvard School of Public Health professor of health policy who studies gun-homicide rates. "Maybe it just was hyperbole." The FBI-estimated homicide rate for the United States in 2013 was 4.6 deaths per 100,000 population. The World Health Organization estimate is a bit higher at 5.4. For our calculations, we’ll use the official and most recent FBI rate of 4.6, though it doesn’t matter either way to debunk Brand’s point. While either estimate is considerably higher than the homicide rate of other Western, high-income countries, it is not remotely as much as Brand suggests. Canada, for example, had a WHO-estimated homicide rate of 1.8 deaths per 100,000 population. So the U.S. rate is a little less than three times higher. The homicide rate in the U.S. was three times higher than the United Kingdom (1.5 per 100,000) and about eight times that of Switzerland (0.6 per 100,000). Compared to Japan (0.9 per 100,000), the U.S. rate is five times higher. We put together a table of of all the developed nations, using the World Bank definition of high-income countries. The reason the United States has such a high homicide rate compared to those countries is tied to the fact that it has more firearms per capita and more permissive gun control laws. A 2003 analysis, while more than a decade old, concluded the U.S. firearm homicide rate was more than 20 times the rate of Australia, France, United Kingdom (except Northern Ireland), Israel, South Korea, Japan, Norway, Poland and Slovenia. (See a related fact-check.) The findings, published in the Journal of Trauma, Injury, Infection and Critical Care, also found that the firearm homicide rate was strikingly larger among American 15-24-year-olds compared to peer countries — 42.7 times bigger, as a matter of fact. That’s closer to the number Brand presented, but it’s not how he presented it. Regardless, experts cautioned against drawing sweeping conclusions about murder rates from country to country. Every nation presents a new set of societal differences, and developing countries in particular have various definitions and methods of counting homicides, said Alan Lizotte, University at Albany professor and dean of the School of Criminal Justice. "It’s not really good to compare countries to each other without considering the culture," he said. The turbulent history of the United States partially explains today’s violent American society, he said, from Western settlers’ hostile encounters with the indigenous population to the haphazard move out west and the underlying history of defending oneself and one’s property. The Canadians, by contrast, were more peaceful as they settled their western territories, sending out mounties to look for new land to inhabit and making peace with the native population first, Lizotte said. "The main point is when you’re comparing countries, you’re comparing things that don’t compare very well," he said. Emails to Brand’s representatives were not returned. Our ruling Brand said, "The American murder rate is 50 times that of any other developed nation." Yes, the American homicide rate is pretty bad, at least compared to most of its high-income peers. But it’s not even close to being as bad as Brand suggests. For instance, the homicide rate in the United States is just three times higher than that in the United Kingdom. Brand considerably overstated things. We rate his claim False. Update (6:30 p.m. June 2) -- After we published our fact-check, a producer for The Trews said Brand meant to say 15, not 50. She said the "n" may have been clipped off due to editing.	None	Russell Brand	None	None	None	2015-06-02T11:43:50	2015-05-26	['United_States']
pomt-11322	"Since 1999, firearm deaths in Ohio have risen 58 percent."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2018/apr/12/richard-cordray/cordray-point-about-increase-firearm-deaths-ohio/	Richard Cordray, a Democrat who has supported gun rights in the past, is playing defense during the Ohio primary for governor on his position on guns. Cordray received an A grade from the NRA and was endorsed by the Buckeye Firearms Association in 2010 when he ran for Ohio Attorney General. But during this campaign he has stated his support for some changes to gun laws, including universal background checks and raising the age to purchase a firearm to 21 in Ohio. One of his May 8 primary opponents, Dennis Kucinich, has portrayed Cordray as soft on guns and attacked him for helping a gun-rights group hold a rally in 2010. On his 2018 campaign website, Cordray has raised concerns about homicide and suicide gun deaths. "The numbers are truly alarming," Cordray wrote, and then cited a series of statistics about gun violence including this one: "Since 1999, firearm deaths in Ohio have risen 58 percent." Cordray is correct about the increase in firearm deaths in Ohio since 1999. Although he didn’t address the reasons behind the increase, we will explain some of the evidence about the increase. CDC data Cordray’s campaign pointed to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing the increase in firearm deaths. There were 8.28 firearm deaths per 100,000 residents in Ohio in 1999 rising to 13.12 in 2016 -- an increase of 58 percent. There was an increase in both the rate of firearm deaths in suicides and homicides. Firearm death data Ohio in 1999 Ohio in 2016 Rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 8.28 13.12 Sheer number of firearm deaths 939 1,524 Cordray used a CDC set of data that started in 1999. But if we looked back a few years earlier in the 1990s, we found a higher rate of firearm deaths -- for example 11.73 in 1991. So if Cordray had drawn on a comparison from an earlier year in the 1990s, it wouldn’t show as much of a contrast as comparing 1999 and 2016. Why did gun deaths increase in Ohio Why gun deaths have increased in Ohio is the more difficult question to answer -- something that Cordray didn’t comment about on his website. Randolph Roth, co-founder of the Historical Violence Database at Ohio State University, told PolitiFact that there has been a tremendous surge in homicides in recent years in Ohio’s major cities. The year 2016 was Cleveland’s deadliest year in a decade. The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported that Cleveland's uptick in homicides was particularly significant but continued an upward trend that began in 2014 and intensified in 2015. Richard Rosenfeld, a criminology professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, pointed to the opioid crisis as a factor in the increase in homicides in Ohio. Using CDC data, he showed that the increases in firearm deaths are primarily in the midwest and Ohio. "The opioid increase is disproportionately concentrated in the midwest and also concentrated among whites," Rosenfeld told PolitiFact. Rosenfeld elaborated on that point in a 2017 paper for the National Institute of Justice in which he called for more research on the causes behind the homicide rise. Jim Irvine, a volunteer with the Buckeye Firearms Association, noted that CDC data shows an increase in suicides overall and that "guns are one of several methods/tools used." CDC data shows that the rate of suicides both by firearms -- and without firearms -- increased between 1999 and 2016 in Ohio. The Buckeye Firearms Association hasn’t endorsed in the Democratic primary but did endorse Attorney General Mike DeWine in the Republican primary. The association endorsed Cordray for Attorney General when he ran against DeWine in 2010. Our ruling Cordray said on his website that "since 1999, firearm deaths in Ohio have risen 58 percent." Data from the Centers for Disease Control showed that there were 8.28 firearm deaths per 100,000 residents in Ohio in 1999 rising to 13.12 in 2016 -- an increase of 58 percent. Firearm deaths in suicides and homicides increased. If Cordray had selected an earlier year in the 1990s, the contrast would not have been as extreme when there was a higher rate of firearm deaths. However, his comparison of 1999 and 2016 is one valid way to examine the data. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-08618	"Speaker Pelosi ... has been busy sticking the taxpayer with her $100,000 bar tab for alcohol on the military jets that she's flying."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/21/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-accuses-nancy-pelosi-spending-100/	Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., delivered one of her signature hard-hitting speeches at the Values Voter Summit, a conference for socially conservative activists on Sept. 17, 2010. At one point, Bachmann took a shot at the woman who leads her chamber, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Pelosi, Bachmann said, "has been busy sticking the taxpayer with her $100,000 bar tab for alcohol on the military jets that she's flying." Bachmann was referring to the Air Force jets that Pelosi uses to fly internationally and back to her home in San Francisco. (Her Republican predecessor, Dennis Hastert of Illinois, used them as well, under a program approved under President George W. Bush.) Bachman's claim drew a rapid counterattack from the Speaker's office, as aides revived arguments they'd used when the allegation first surfaced months earlier. Among other things, Pelosi's office noted that the Speaker "does not drink alcohol" and that there "is no alcohol service on the domestic flights the Air Force operates for travel from Washington to San Francisco for the Speaker." Two politicians diverging over the facts? Sounds like a job for PolitiFact. We tracked down the original source of Bachmann's allegation, which was a large collection of documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act by Judicial Watch, a conservative group that litigates on public corruption and other issues. In a press release summarizing the findings, Judicial Watch wrote that "the Speaker’s military travel cost the United States Air Force $2,100,744.59 over a two-year period — $101,429.14 of which was for in-flight expenses, including food and alcohol." The release gave as an example one Congressional delegation that traveled from Washington through Tel Aviv to Baghdad between May 15, 2008, and May 20, 2008, "to discuss matters of mutual concern with government leaders." The purchases included "Johnny Walker Red scotch, Grey Goose vodka, E&J brandy, Bailey’s Irish Crème, Maker’s Mark whiskey, Courvoisier cognac, Bacardi Light rum, Jim Beam whiskey, Beefeater gin, Dewars scotch, Bombay Sapphire gin, Jack Daniels whiskey, Corona beer and several bottles of wine," the release said. Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton seized on the party-plane theme. "Speaker Pelosi has a history of wasting taxpayer funds with her boorish demands for military travel," Fitton was quoted as saying in the release. "And these documents suggest the Speaker’s congressional delegations are more about partying than anything else." Other critics of Pelosi piled on soon after the Judicial Watch documents came to light. World Net Daily, a conservative website, led its article by saying that the purchases for the 2008 trip "reads like a dream order for a wild frat party ... But that single receipt makes up just part of the more than $101,000 taxpayers paid for 'in-flight services' -– including food and liquor -- for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi." To Pelosi's critics, it must be irresistible to paint a rival as someone who leads debauched lawmakers on cushy overseas trips, only to stick taxpayers with the bill. But Bachmann's version of the facts is way off base. Bachmann said at the Values Voter Summit that Pelosi "has been busy sticking the taxpayer with her $100,000 bar tab for alcohol on the military jets that she's flying." To us, Bachmann is clearly saying that Pelosi has spent $100,000 specifically on alcohol -- but that interpretation doesn't fly with the Judicial Watch summary. The news release said that the $101,429.14 amount was for "in-flight expenses, including food and alcohol." But our friends at the website FactCheck.org determined that the sum spent on alcohol is a small proportion of that amount and that not all of the expenses were in-flight. "It’s clear that Judicial Watch is counting as 'in-flight expenses' any non-reimbursable Air Force expenditure besides transportation costs," FactCheck.org wrote. "That category actually includes all non-plane costs of the trip, including baggage fees, meeting room rentals and refreshments, and, frequently, good-will lapel pins — as well as meals, ground transportation and lodging in U.S. territory." A spokeswoman for Judicial Watch confirmed to PolitiFact that "the tab amount includes, but is not limited to, alcohol and food." Incidentally, the receipt that was the source of the "frat party" jab in World Net Daily, and which was also linked to in Judicial Watch's press release, shows a decidedly more modest pricetag for the "bar tab" -- namely, $560.28, purchased at what appears to have been a no-frills base exchange at Maryland's Bolling Air Force Base near Washington, D.C. The full receipt isn't reproduced in the FOIA documents, so we can't be sure what percentage is food and what percentage is alcohol. But even if you use the full amount to extrapolate the total paid for alcohol, it doesn't come close to $100,000 Bachmann says. If Pelosi is to be believed that no alcohol is served on her domestic flights (which account for most of the flights she took as Speaker) and if you agree with FactCheck.org that she took a total of 12 international trips, then the total cost of alcohol would have been something less than $7,000, far lower than Bachmann's $100,000. It's fair game to argue that buying liquor for lawmaker jaunts is an unjustifiable taxpayer expenditure even if perfectly legal. However, if Bachmann wanted to criticize these outlays, she should have read the Judicial Watch news release more closely. Since Bachmann (or her staff) didn't do so, she ended up citing a figure for alcohol expenditures that was close to the much larger number for all non-plane costs of the trip.

pomt-10666	"One out of every four homeless people on our streets is a veteran."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/26/john-edwards/study-quantifies-homeless-vets/	In a Christmas message that ran as a television ad, John Edwards said he wanted to remember the less fortunate. He opened with the surprising statistic: One in four homeless people is a vet. Counting the number of homeless people is a challenging proposition, much less quantifying their military backgrounds. The number appears to come from a November 2007 study from the National Alliance to End Homelessness. The nonprofit used data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs that estimated the number of homeless veterans in a given VA facility's service area. The alliance than combined that data with their own population estimates for the homeless nationwide. The study cited data from 2005 that showed out of 744,313 homeless people in a given year, 194,254 were veterans. That means that 26 percent of the homeless are veterans, even though veterans only make up 11 percent of the U.S. population over 18 years old, according to U.S. Census data. The study counted people who were homeless at any time, even briefly, during the year, not just the chronically homeless. It's also worth noting that the number of homeless veterans fluctuates over time because of natural demographic changes and because of the numbers of people who served in the military at any given time in history. Homeless advocates expect the percentage of homeless veterans is a number that changes as the years go by. The 2007 study is an estimate, but it's based on data compiled, at least in part, by a federal agency, and it appears to be the latest data available. Other studies have found lower estimates of the national homeless population, but using a more conservative number for the overall homeless would have the effect of increasing the percentage of homeless veterans. Although Edwards is relying on the best available data, it's still extremely difficult to count homeless people because not all of them come in contact with service providers or other agencies. Some have health issues like addiction and mental illness that make them reluctant to be counted. Even reputable studies sometimes find different estimates for the homeless. Though the percentage of homeless veterans is an estimate, the number Edwards cites appears to be based on the latest available and was partially compiled by the federal agency that serves veterans. So he is on solid ground. But we have to take off a little bit for his emphatic statement of what's actually a complex estimate. For that reason, we find his statement to be Mostly True.

pomt-03774	"Almost 1,000 people a day" are moving to Florida "because they are more free here than they are in some other states."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/apr/02/will-weatherford/will-weatherford-says-1000-people-day-move-florida/	Americans are relocating to Florida in droves, House Speaker Will Weatherford told a group of liberty-loving activists at the Capitol. Why? Freedom! It’s a quantity in short supply in those tax-loving states up north. "You may not know this, but today almost 1,000 people a day are moving to the state of Florida," he said at a rally by Americans for Prosperity Florida on March 19, 2013. "Do you know why they're coming here? Because they are more free here than they are in some other states." We checked out Weatherford’s number for new Floridians and why they’re coming here. Grab your U-Haul and come along for the ride. Population estimates Weatherford spokesman Ryan Duffy sent us a March 2013 Sarasota Herald-Tribune article about Florida’s booming population growth. "Fueled by job seekers, foreign immigrants and baby boomer retirees," Florida will soon surpass New York in population, the article states. Duffy honed in on one line: "Moody's is among those predicting Florida's population will swell by 360,000 this year." Weatherford divided 360,000 by 365, which comes out to 986.3 (or "almost 1,000 people a day"). Chris Lafakis, the Moody’s Analytics senior economist behind the projection, told us his figure is based on net migration, which is the number of people moving in minus those moving out, plus the number of births minus deaths. It includes people who move here from other countries, not just other states. Mekael Teshome, a PNC Financial Services Group economist, told us the Moody’s projection is on the high side, and his estimate for population growth in 2013 is in the upper 200,000s. Weatherford is not the only politician touting the number of people moving into the state. Gov. Rick Scott said on CNN and in other interviews that 230,000 people moved to Florida in 2012, referencing census numbers. We should note that people have been moving to Florida since the state was founded. In the 1980s, when Democrats controlled most every branch of state government, about 875 people on average moved to Florida every day, according to census figures. In the 1970s -- while Democrats were in control -- an average of 810 people moved to Florida every day. In the 2000s, during the economic crisis and under Republican control, an average of around 772 people moved to Florida every day. Why Florida? We thought of a few ways to interpret Weatherford’s claim that people are moving to Florida because of freedom. Cubans who arrive on Miami-Dade shores? Fair to say they are moving here for freedom. New York retirees trading in their down coats for swim suits? We’re not sure they’d say freedom (unless they mean freedom from snow). Asked to clarify Weatherford’s remarks, his spokesman sent us materials indicating he meant economic freedom. He directed us to a study by the business-backed Tax Foundation that showed Florida ranked No. 27 of states with the highest tax burdens. New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and California topped the list. Does this really explain our population boom? Economists typically don’t factor in value judgments, Teshome said. But they still have an idea of what brings people to, ahem, the Sunshine State. "Florida’s great weather and abundant white-collar job opportunities are what primarily attract individuals," Lafakis said, "but the lack of a personal income tax and a pretty friendly business climate certainly help." The population uptick is picking up as the result of an improving national economy that enables out-of-staters to sell their houses and buy new ones in Florida, Teshome said. The University of Florida’s Bureau of Economic and Business Research conducts a random monthly telephone survey of state residents. For respondents who say they have moved to Florida, be it one year ago or many, researchers ask about their primary reason for the move. From January 2012 to February 2013, the top results were family/marriage (29 percent), job (22 percent) and climate/weather (18.9 percent). The "other" category, which includes reasons such as retirement, and makes up 14.6 percent of results. Jobs are the main reason people relocate to Florida in their 20s, 30s and 40s, said Stan Smith, professor of economics and director of the Population Program in the Bureau of Economic and Business Research (BEBR) at the University of Florida. For those in their 50s and 60s, climate is the No. 1 reason. Family reasons are a factor in basically each age group, he said. "Freedom" itself is not a category, though 2.1 percent said they moved for the low cost of living and 1 percent said political reasons. Florida’s cost of living used to be substantially lower than the rest of the states 30 or 40 years ago, but the state moved to the middle of the pack in recent years, Smith said. And even though Florida does not have a state income tax, residents pay more for home insurance, prices for which soared after the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons. Finally, the conservative Mercatus Center at George Mason University releases an annual report examining freedom in each state, using a comprehensive checklist that looks at measures such as taxes and government spending, the liability system, property rights and even throwing a bachelor party. Florida falls in the middle of the pack at No. 23. Florida ranks well above average for education and its fiscal policies, but the state lost standing for its debt burden and restrictions on civil liberties. The center recommended spending less on services such as police and fire protection, airports, parks, and sanitation and ending mandatory minimum sentences for victimless crimes. Our ruling Weatherford said almost 1,000 people a day are moving to Florida "because they are more free here than they are in some other states." The number is actually a projection of the 2013 net migration. In 2012, census data shows that about 630 people on average moved to Florida each day. Our problem, however, is more with his assertion of why people are migrating to Florida. There's no real evidence to suggest it's freedom -- as in the business and tax climate -- as Weatherford suggests. Survey data shows most people move here because of family, jobs and weather. And in fact, when you look at Florida history, the state has seen similar population growth under both Republicans and Democrats. We rate Weatherford's claim Mostly False.

pomt-10682	"We reduced abortion. We increased adoptions by 135 percent."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/13/rudy-giuliani/creative-math-by-an-abortion-rights-mayor/	At the Des Moines Register debate on Dec. 12, 2007, Rudy Giuliani acknolwedged a touchy point for his campaign: He supports abortion rights. But he emphasized that he dislikes abortion and repeated a claim he's made before, that while he was mayor of New York City, the number of abortions declined while adoptions rose. "We reduced abortion. We increased adoptions by 135 percent," he said. We've addressed his previous claims with this ruling and our article "Giuliani's 'culture of life,' defined" , but he used different wording and a different number this time, so we'll examine the new statement. He's right that abortions went down. They declined 16.8 percent during Giuliani's eight-year tenure, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, his wording suggests he took an active, leading role in reducing abortions. That doesn't square with his record. When we examined his tenure for our previous article, we spoke with key players familiar with his record, and they remembered a decidely abortion-rights mayor who went so far as to sign a proclamation for "Roe vs. Wade Anniversary Day." He also filled out a questionnaire for an abortion-rights group pledging his support for the cause. So for him to say "we reduced abortion" seems like a stretch. Two months ago, the Giuliani campaign maintained there was a link between the rise in adoptions and the decline in abortions. They now say he is not linking the two. But we believe many voters could be left with the impression that the two are related. And indeed, we couldn't find any research that showed an increase in adoptions led to a decrease in abortions. There's no question that adoptions rose during his term. But to reach 135 percent requires some serious calculator gymnastics. Two years into his first term, Giuliani created the Administration for Children's Services with a mission to improve the lives of the city's children. The agency aims to help kids in foster care, and it measures its success in large part by how many adoptions it facilitates each year. We focus on page 14 of the ACS 2003 Year End Review, which shows a bar chart of adoptions conducted through the city's child welfare system from 1989 to 2003. Giuliani was mayor from Jan. 1, 1994, to Dec. 31, 2001. His new agency came on line in January 1996. The chart shows a gradual increase in adoptions from 1989 through 1994, then a steeper increase through 1997 — the middle years of Giuliani's tenure. After that year, the numbers decline through 2002. Giuliani has previously said the rate of adoptions went up 65 to 70 percent. His campaign calculated that number by taking adoption rates for the six years before ACS was created and comparing them to the six years after. But now, Giuliani is citing a number twice as large: 135 percent. To get that number, his staff compared adoptions in all eight of his fiscal years against all eight of his predecessors'. This works out to a whopping 133 percent increase in adoptions, which Giuliani rounded up to 135. That's one way to look at it. But a more traditional way, simply comparing adoption rates in the first year of his tenure and in the last year, shows the rate increased by only 17 percent, a point first made by our friends at FactCheck.org. The Giuliani campaign said averaging the rates over two six-year (or now, eight-year) blocks helps smooth out peaks and valleys in individual years caused by social, economic and other forces. The first two years after ACS came on line, there was a spike in adoptions that Giuliani's campaign said was because of a backlog of foster kids waiting to connect with families. It's true, the campaign aides say, the numbers go down significantly in Giuliani's final two years. But they're still higher than those of his predecessor, David Dinkins. We find that's an unorthodox way of comparing the numbers and it relies on a different methodology than the abortion rate. For the abortion statistic, the Giuliani campaign looked at two points in time (the beginning and end of his tenure) and compared the two. Doing that for adoptions yields an increase of 17 percent. But here, they're trying some creative math to boost the number to 133. So, we find that while he's got his numbers right on abortion rates, it's a stretch for the abortion-rights mayor to take credit. We also find he has inflated the adoption figures by getting fancy with his math. It's worth saying again that to arrive at the "135 percent" increase in adoption rates the Giuliani campaign had to change the way it had been calculating those rates just a few months ago. We find his overall claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-07705	A telecom bill could keep the State Corporation Commission from getting rate-of-return information from electric utilities.	false	/virginia/statements/2011/mar/05/ward-armstrong/ward-armstrong-says-telecom-bill/	House Minority Leader Ward Armstrong has been battling with Virginia’s largest electric utilities for more than a year. During the last week of the recently-concluded General Assembly session, that fight spilled into the debate on a telecommunications bill. Armstrong, D-Henry, was irked by several provisions in the legislation designed to modernize regulation as the state moves from a monopoly utility system to a new environment with many competitors. Armstrong, who is exploring a run for statewide office in 2013, charged in a fiery floor speech on Feb. 21 that the bill would allow phone companies to refuse to run new landlines if there was an alternative for customers, such as using cell phone service. He also railed that the State Corporation Commission was worried the legislation could hinder its ability to regulate electric utilities. Although the bill was approved by the General Assembly and is now on Gov. Bob McDonnell’s desk, the acrimony did not die. Several Republicans publicly accused Armstrong of spreading false information on the House floor. Armstrong, in return, defended his remarks. So we looked at both of Armstrong’s charges. Armstrong, in thundering floor speech, compared the regulation bill to a ticking time bomb. "Let me quote the SCC report. ‘If this legislation, SB 1368, would limit such record keeping only to companies required to file rate of return statements annually, this could adversely impact the commission’s ability to get necessary rate of return information from electric utilities such as Dominion Virginia Power and Appalachian Power.’ "Where did that come from?" he demanded, "Where did that little nugget appear, that we’re going to allow Dominion and Appalachian not to submit rate of return information?" The SCC regulates Virginia’s public utilities, including electric companies and certain segments of the telephone industry. The report Armstrong quoted was prepared by the SCC’s Division of Communications and released Jan. 24. As Armstrong said, regulators initially had concerns about rate of return language. Electric utility regulation is complicated, but the SCC explains it this way: Regulated companies like ApCo and Dominion are allowed to "recover through their rates their ‘reasonable and prudent’ operating expenses, plus a ‘fair’ rate of return (profit) on their ‘rate base,’ which is the value of their capital investment in things like generating stations and the distribution grid." Ensuring a fair rate of return requires lots of information on expenses, investments and other activities at the utilities, so there are rules ensuring the electric companies keep the detailed records needed by regulators. The SCC initially worried this law would undermine those rules. So the SCC brought its concerns to the House Committee on Commerce and Labor, where the bill was being debated. The panel amended the bill on Feb. 3 to state: "All public utilities doing business in the Commonwealth that file rate of return statements shall ... maintain all records necessary to prepare and submit annually a rate of return statement." William Irby, director of the SCC’s Division of Communications, told us the amendment satisfied his department’s concerns. "Rate of return is not affected by this bill," he said. Armstrong’s speech pointing to the SCC’s concerns came on Feb. 21 -- almost three weeks after the concerns he was citing had been addressed. Claire Wilker, Armstrong’s chief of staff, said her boss first learned about the change after his floor speech. She said nobody told Armstrong that the SCC’s concerns had been addressed in committee and that corrections had been made. "We were pleased to find out that rate of return had been corrected," she said. "That’s a positive." But Armstrong, speaking the day after he was supposedly corrected, said "I don’t make any apologies when I stand up for the people of my district and for the people of this state." He also said he would not apologize for sending out an e-mail that repeated the incorrect information on electric utilities. Let’s review the record and put this debate to rest. Ward Armstrong told the entire House of Delegates that a telecom bill could undo important regulations on electric utilities. And though he cited a report from the SCC, he spoke on the bill nearly three weeks after the regulatory body’s concerns about the issue were addressed by a House Committee. This is the second time during the 2011 session Armstrong has used faulty or outdated information during floor speeches about electric utilities. On the last occasion, regarding incorrectly stated utility rate increases, we gave him the benefit of the doubt because the error involved data sent by the SCC to Armstrong. There are no excuses this time around. Any delegate speaking about a bill on the House floor should know what the legislation says, especially when changes occurred nearly three weeks before his remarks. We rate Armstrong’s statement False.	None	Ward Armstrong	None	None	None	2011-03-05T08:00:21	2011-02-21	['None']

Conservative activist Michael Quinn Sullivan offered the answer in a Feb. 18 e-mail blast: "If you printed a $1 bill for the entirety of the $14.1 trillion national debt, the resulting pile of money would weigh more than 136 aircraft carriers," said the president of the free-market group Empower Texans. Sullivan pointed us to the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which prints billions of dollars each year for the Federal Reserve. According to frequently-asked-questions page on the bureau's website, a U.S. note worth any amount — from $1 to a Benjamin — weighs one gram. About 454 grams equals a pound. According to the Treasury Department’s Bureau of Public Debt, the total outstanding public debt as of Feb. 18 was about $14.1 trillion. So,14.1 trillion dollar bills weigh 14.1 trillion grams, or about 31 billion pounds. At Sullivan’s suggestion, we checked the weight of the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier. According to the military’s Naval Vessel Register, there are a couple of ways to put the carrier on the scale. At its full displacement, including crew, cargo and ammunition, the USS Reagan weighs 98,235 long tons. That’s 220,046,400 pounds. And 136 USS Reagans? About 30 billion pounds. When the ship is ready for service but missing its crew and ammunition, among other variables, the Reagan weighs 77,607 long tons, or 173,839,680 pounds. Multiply by 136 and you’ve got nearly 24 billion pounds of empty aircraft carrier. But what’s the point of an empty ship? We found that other aircraft carriers, fully loaded, weighed about the same. The USS George H. W. Bush weighs in the same as the Reagan, while the USS George Washington weighs 104,017 long tons at its full displacement. That’s 232,998,080 pounds. That means 136 Washingtons weigh about 31.5 billion pounds — 500 million pounds more than the national debt. And the USS Harry S. Truman? They’re a svelte 101,378 long tons at full displacement, so it takes more than 136 of them to equal the the national debt. Weighing in: The national debt in dollars totals more than 136 fully loaded USS Reagan, Bush and Truman aircraft carriers. Other carrier weights differ, but they’re in the ballpark. We rate Sullivan’s statement as True.	None	Michael Sullivan	None	None	None	2011-02-25T06:00:00	2011-02-18	['None']
pomt-01005	Under Common Core standards, it takes "more than a minute" to teach a student "how to add nine plus six."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/feb/03/greg-abbott/under-common-core-teaching-simple-addition-takes-f/	Under Common Core, it takes far too long for a teacher to show a student how to do simple addition, said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. In 2013, the Texas Legislature passed a law prohibiting school districts from using Common Core in their lesson plans. On Fox News Sunday, Abbott argued that Common Core -- the proposed set of education standards that has become a political football -- is a bad idea. He directed viewers toward some evidence. "I hope all your viewers will go to Google and plug in ‘nine plus six Common Core,’ " he said, telling viewers to find a video on YouTube of a news report out of upstate New York. "You'll find it's going to take you more than a minute to see how a teacher teaches a student to learn how to add nine plus six. Chris, these are the Common Core standards that are now being pushed down from the top that we must get away from." In the video, a teacher gives an addition lesson directed at early elementary school-age children. She adds nine and six by first splitting the six into one and five, then adding the one to the nine to make 10. So the problem becomes 10 plus five equals 15. "Our young learners might not be altogether comfortable thinking about what 9 plus 6 is. They are quite comfortable thinking about their friend 10," the teacher says." Now our students are seeing that we have 10 plus 5…. That is much more comfortable than looking at 9 plus 6." Responding to Abbott on Fox, former U.S. Secretary of Education Bill Bennett, a conservative supporter of Common Core, said, "I haven't seen this (video) but I'm going to tell you if it's crazy, it probably isn't Common Core. It's probably one of these myths that's developed," and he encouraged viewers to read the Common Core standards for themselves. So we decided to download the video as well as the Common Core standards to find out if this addition strategy is in fact a part of Common Core. It turns out that this method is in line with what the Common Core standards drafters had in mind, but it’s not a bizarre concept, as Abbott implies. Math teachers have been using methods like this for decades. The standards First, let’s clarify a couple things. Abbott said these standards are being pushed down "from the top" -- meaning the federal level. Common Core is not a federal mandate -- adopting these standards is voluntary for states (though they can have better access to federal education money if they take them on). Additionally, Common Core does not prescribe or require any particular method of teaching. Nowhere in the standards does it say that teachers must teach addition by first splitting numbers up to create 10. Common Core standards, rather, identify concepts that students should learn at each grade level -- not how teachers should teach them. That being said, the standards do suggest that teachers use methods similar to that used in the video to teach first-graders how to add and subtract within the number 20. It suggests: "Use strategies such as counting on; making ten (e.g., 8 + 6 = 8 + 2 + 4 = 10 + 4 = 14); decomposing a number leading to a ten (e.g., 13 – 4 = 13 – 3 – 1 = 10 – 1 = 9)... and creating equivalent but easier or known sums (e.g., adding 6 + 7 by creating the known equivalent 6 + 6 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13)." Math education experts told us that the method used in the video are in line with the Common Core standards’ intention -- which is to teach children foundational math strategies that they can use for more sophisticated problems down the line. Although it does take the teacher in the video just under a minute to teach the equation, it’s not as if the teacher has to go through those motions for every single addition problem. She’s teaching a strategy that students can apply to other problems on their own. "What Gov. Abbott is missing is that the teacher in the video is doing much more than teaching a fact," said Valerie Mills, president of the National Council of Supervisors of Mathematics. "She is helping students to build an understanding of operations (addition in this case) and of how our number system works." That way, when a child is older and has to add larger numbers, they can use the strategy to add quickly. (For example 149 plus 236 becomes 150 plus 235 to make 385.) It’s also worth noting that one of the reporters in the video says, "When you and I were in school, we used to memorize that nine plus six is 15. Not anymore." That’s actually not the case. By second grade, according to the Common Core standards, students are expected to have these facts memorized, after they learn the foundations of how to add in first grade. How different is this? Abbott makes it seem like this way of teaching addition is a deviation from what schools already do. Diane Briars, president of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, said teachers have used techniques like splitting a number into parts of 10 for addition -- rather than straight memorization -- since the 1950s at least, and the research showing its benefits goes back to the 1920s. She sent us pages in a textbook from the 1990s that includes the method from the video. "It has long been best practice for early childhood math," Briars said. In fact, they match up with Texas’ state standards for first-grade math, said William McCallum, a University of Arizona math professor who was involved in drafting the Common Core standards. The Texas standards say for first-graders: "Students extend their use of addition and subtraction beyond the actions of joining and separating to include comparing and combining. Students use properties of operations and the relationship between addition and subtraction to solve problems." And, more explicitly, students are expected to "apply basic fact strategies to add and subtract within 20, including making 10 and decomposing a number leading to a 10." "The general belief is that the Texas state standards are modeled word for word on the Common Core state standards," Mills said. Although these ideas have been around for so long, that doesn’t mean that all parents necessarily learned with these methods, which might be why they perceive Common Core standards as something foreign, Mills added. "I can see why the governor would watch that video and say ‘oh my gosh,’ " she said. Our ruling Abbott said that under Common Core standards, it takes "more than a minute" to teach a student "how to add nine plus six." There is a video that shows a teacher demonstrating how to add nine plus six to make 15, and it takes just under a minute. But the method she uses is not explicitly required by the Common Core standards, though the standards suggest this approach for teaching addition to first-graders. Abbott’s claim is misleading, though, in that it implies that this method takes an unusually long time or teaches something in a new way. These methods have been around for years and pre-date Common Core. In fact, they align with Texas’ own state standards. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.	None	Greg Abbott	None	None	None	2015-02-03T17:15:46	2015-02-01	['None']
pomt-10550	"She flunked the D.C. bar exam."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/15/chain-email/she-failed-then-followed-bill/	In an article for a conservative Internet journal that has been widely distributed via chain e-mail, former Clinton adviser-turned-foe Dick Morris points out a little-known embarrassment about Sen. Hillary Clinton, who was a star law student at Yale. "She flunked the D.C. bar exam and only passed the Arkansas bar," he wrote. It's true. In his biography of Hillary Clinton, former Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein notes that in the summer of 1973, 817 people took the Washington, D.C., bar exam; 551 of them passed. Hillary Rodham was not one of them. "For the first time in her life she had flamed out — spectacularly, given the expectations of others for her, and even more so her own," Bernstein wrote. Bernstein said Clinton kept the news hidden for 30 years and shocked some of her closest friends when she made the revelation with a passing reference in her 2003 autobiography, Living History. She even spins it into a positive. "Despite the satisfaction of my work, I was lonely and missed Bill more than I could stand," she wrote. "I had taken both the Arkansas and Washington, D.C., bar exams during the summer, but my heart was pulling me toward Arkansas. When I learned that I passed in Arkansas but failed in D.C., I thought that maybe my test scores were telling me something." So she followed Bill Clinton to Arkansas. She became a faculty member in the School of Law at the University of Arkansas, where Bill Clinton also taught. And in 1975, the two married. Wrote Bernstein: "There can only be conjecture about what turn her life — and the nation's — might have taken had she not failed the exam." But she did, and this statement is True.

pomt-00389	"We’re making (Medicare) stronger. We’re making Social Security stronger."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/sep/06/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrongly-says-social-security-and-medi/	President Donald Trump is rejecting the image of policy chaos and bitter staff infighting captured in the latest book by Washington Post editor Bob Woodward. At a meeting with Kuwait’s leader Sheikh Al-Sabah, Trump called the book "fiction" and said in contrast to what it describes, no administration has gotten more done on tax cuts, deregulation and the courts than his. And the accomplishments don’t end there. "We’re saving Medicare," Trump said Sept. 5. "The Democrats want to destroy Medicare. If you look at what they’re doing, they’re going to destroy Medicare. And we will save it. We will keep it going. We’re making it stronger. We’re making Social Security stronger. We’re making our whole country stronger. So all you have to do is look at the achievements." In this fact-check, we look at whether the Trump administration has made Medicare and Social Security stronger. Key takeaways Compared with estimates a year ago, the primary trust fund for Medicare runs out three years sooner. The primary trust fund for Social Security runs out one year sooner. The Republican tax cuts trimmed a year of solvency from the primary Medicare trust fund and had a negative effect on the Social Security trust fund. Medicare Medicare serves almost one out of six Americans. It’s primarily health insurance for people 65 and older, but it also helps millions of citizens with disabilities. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Medicare’s core program, Part A, covers hospital care, and it’s an entitlement. Anyone who qualifies gets the coverage and the government funding is automatic, not subject to the annual budget decisions of Congress. The money for Part A comes out of the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. Payroll taxes provide about 90 percent of the trust fund’s income. Coming in a distant second are taxes on wealthier Social Security recipients, which provide about 8 percent of total revenues. In their 2018 report, the Medicare Trustees forecast that fund would run out of money in 2026. A year earlier, they said it would last until 2029. On Trump’s watch, it lost three years of solvency. In a presentation at the American Enterprise Institute, a market-oriented think tank, the chief actuary at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Paul Spitalnic said two of the lost years were due to lower than expected wage growth. But the other lost year came from the Republican tax cuts. "The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 decreased individual tax rates and as a result, there is somewhat less income coming into the trust fund," Spitalnic said. "That does have an effect of making depletion of the trust fund a year earlier." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Social Security The tax cut law had a similar impact on Social Security. Social Security has two parts -- the Old Age and Survivors Trust Fund, which served 51 million people in 2017, and the Disability Trust Fund, which served 10 million. According to the 2018 Social Security Trustees report, the total price tag in 2017 was $952 billion. The Old Age and Survivors fund is the big one for retired people, with about $2.8 trillion. The Disability fund had $71 billion at the end of 2017. With costs rising faster than income, the larger fund is expected to run dry in 2034. A year earlier, the projection was for 2035. So that’s a loss of one year of solvency. The trustees listed several factors for the worsening situation, including the tax cut law, the expected end of DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an immigration program Trump opposes), and lower-than-expected wage increases. All three reduced the dollars coming into the trust fund. The one bright spot was with the Disability Insurance Trust Fund. While by far the smaller of the two, its projected solvency date was extended by four years, driven by a fall in the number of people claiming benefits. White House staff noted that the economy is growing and growth helps Social Security and Medicare. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the same when the latest trustees reports came out in June. Not all economists agree that growth will solve all. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a deficit control group, argues that growth leads to higher prices, which in turn increases program costs. The White House also said payroll contributions are up since last year. But unless revenues come in faster than outlays, the trust funds continue to lose ground. Outside assessments We asked Olivia Mitchell, a professor and leading analyst of social insurance funds at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, how she would assess the status of Social Security and Medicare. "Trump’s administration has done nothing to strengthen Social Security or Medicare," Mitchell said. Health policy professor Paul Ginsburg with the University of Southern California and the Brookings Institution told us that he’s hard pressed to remember a tax bill that left the Medicare trust fund worse off. "The recent change, where legislation moved the date forward, is very unusual and reflects the unusual and dangerous mindset in Congress of not caring about increases in the deficit," Ginsburg said. Our ruling Trump said that his administration is making Medicare and Social Security stronger. The forecast for both programs is worse today than a year ago. The main Medicare trust fund is expected to run out of money three years sooner. The main Social Security trust fund is expected to run out one year sooner. The Republican tax cut law and lower-than-projected wages accounted for most of the downgrade. We rate this claim False.

pomt-02618	"We had 6,000 oil and gas spills in 2012" with "more oil and gas spreading in the United States than the entire Exxon Valdez spill."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/23/josh-fox/documentary-filmmaker-josh-fox-claims-6000-oil-and/	Some environmental advocates object to calling the seepage of 7,500 gallons of coal-cleaning chemicals into the Elk River (thereby cutting off access to tap water for 300,000 West Virginia residents) as a "spill." Environmental activist and documentary filmmaker Josh Fox offered "state of permanent criminal negligence" as an alternative descriptor in a Jan. 19 appearance on MSNBC’s Melissa Harris-Perry. "A spill is something that happens by accident. You knock over one of these cups on the table, that's a spill," said Fox, director of the 2010 documentary Gasland. "We had 6,000 oil and gas spills in 2012. That was 16 a day, amounting to more oil and gas spreading in the United States than the entire Exxon Valdez spill." Fox’s statement is a bit different from the topic at hand, as the chemical storage facility leak in West Virginia is not an onshore oil or gas production site. Still, we were intrigued by Fox’s statistic and emailed him about his figure. Fox replied with a July 2013 investigation by EnergyWire that almost precisely offered the same information. The story, part of EnergyWire’s five-part "Overflow" series, took reporter Mike Soraghan four months to report. Soraghan examined state and federal data for onshore oil and gas sites in 2012. There is no central, uniform reporting system for companies to report oil and gas leaks at onshore drilling sites, so Soraghan compiled data from 16 oil states using computer-assisted reporting methods. By his count, the best one available, 2012 saw more than 6,000 reported spills "and other mishaps" at onshore oil and gas sites, amounting to "more than 16 spills a day" and "more than the volume of oil that leaked from the shattered hull of the Exxon Valdez in 1989." Most of the incidents were 100-gallon leaks that could be contained and cleaned up in a day, Soragan wrote. In sum, the spills amounted to at least 15.6 million gallons of oil, fracking fluid, contaminated wastewater and other liquids spilled in 2012. The Exxon Valdez oil spill, in which a tanker hit a reef in Prince William Sound, Alaska, resulted in more than 11 million gallons of crude oil spewing from its hull. The EnergyWire report tallies several kinds of toxic spills, not just gallons of crude oil. That's not a perfect comparison to the Exxon Valdez, of course, but it does show the relative scope of accidents occuring at oil and gas sites. Soragan says his number for onshore well spills is an undercount for several reasons, including the fact that some states where drilling is popular don’t always include the amount of liquid, and he did not include spills from offshore wells, interstate pipelines, or from trains. He points out that North Dakota had the most spills in 2012, but it could be a result of its more stringent reporting standards compared to other states (minimum of 1 barrel, or 42 gallons, compared to 10 barrels in Oklahoma and Montana and a 5-barrel threshold in Texas). "If there was doubt, I left it out," he said. (Interestingly, Soraghan authored a fact-check of Fox’s documentary and its attackers when the film was nominated for an Academy Award.) The federal government maintains data for offshore site spills (like the 2010 BP Gulf of Mexico disaster) and some onshore spills at the federal National Response Center and for pipelines at the Department of Transportation. The rest is often left to states. "We imagine that the number is bigger because there are probably spills that haven’t been identified yet and haven’t been reported," said Anna Mall, senior policy analyst for land and wildlife program of the National Resources Defense Council. "It’s a pattern in the country that we’re very concerned about." Spills that occur at well sites usually happen before a well moves into its formal production phase, said Kenneth B. Medlock III, senior director of the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University. And as Soraghan’s report points out, they are cleaned up rather quickly and do not have much effect on the environment. "In general, operators do everything they can to avoid release of any product because oil and gas production volume is what earns the return for the expenditure on the well," Medlock said. Medlock told us finding a true tally for the number of oil spills is difficult because it requires meticulous tracking of well records and an ability to understand the extent -- and therefore the impact -- of a "spill." In 2011, the BP rig explosion and oil spill still fresh in the public’s mind, CBS News published a similar investigation for incidents and wells, as well as pipelines, from 23 oil- and gas-producing states and federal agencies. "Not counting the BP disaster, we found at least 6,500 spills, leaks, fires or explosions nationwide -- that's 18 a day. Overall, at least 34 million gallons of crude oil and other potentially toxic chemicals were spilled. That's triple the size of the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill." We checked in with oil and gas industry officials to see if we were missing anything. The American Petroleum Institute directed us to a 2009 report about overall American oil spill trends from many sources -- refineries, pipelines, cargo ships, offshore wells -- over the last several decades prepared by an outside environmental consultant. According to the study, overall oil spillage is down 77 percent since the 1960s-70s. However, as the EnergyWire report points out, decreases over the previous decade were mainly at offshore platforms and pipelines, refineries and transportation vessels (but not tanker trucks). Spillage at inland production wells increased, according to the American Petroleum Institute report. Our ruling Filmmaker-activist Josh Fox claimed the country had "6,000 oil and gas spills in 2012, ... amounting to more oil and gas spreading in the United States than the entire Exxon Valdez spill." He correctly cites an energy publication’s investigation about the number of spills at oil and gas sites in 2012. We can’t independently verify the data, as there’s no central hub for it and the reporter compiled it mainly from state agencies over four months. The comparison to the Exxon Valdez spill, however, requires a bit more explanation. The report measures oil, fracking fluid and contaminated wastewater spills, which Fox short-handed to "oil and gas." That's not 100 percent correct and requires a minor clarification. As such, we rate Fox's claim Mostly True.	None	Josh Fox	None	None	None	2014-01-23T11:36:46	2014-01-19	['United_States', 'Exxon_Valdez_oil_spill']
pomt-01369	Under Scott Walker’s policies, "the typical Wisconsin family has actually seen their real income drop by nearly $3,000 in the last four years."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/17/mary-burke/mary-burke-says-walker-fault-nearly-3000-drop-inco/	Democrat Mary Burke wasted no time in her first debate with Gov. Scott Walker, rolling out a blistering economic critique in her opening statement. Beyond the expected reference to Walker’s failure to spur creation of 250,000 jobs as he promised, Burke unveiled a new talking point. "His approach isn’t working," she said Oct. 10, 2014. "The typical Wisconsin family has actually seen their real income drop by nearly $3,000 in the last four years. $3,000!" Not so fast, the Republican Party of Wisconsin countered, quickly issuing a news release with this headline: "Mary Burke Opens Her Disastrous Debate Appearance With A New Lie." Let’s go to the Truth-O-Meter. When asked for backup, the Burke campaign cited income figures reported by the Wisconsin Council on Children & Families following the Sept. 17, 2014 release of data through the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. The American Community Survey is the preferred method for tracking year-to-year changes in median household income at the state level. It is based on a random sampling of residents from every state. The income figures are adjusted for inflation, allowing apples-to-apples comparisons over time. Burke called it "real" income, the technical term for the inflation-adjusted approach. The most recent survey year reported 2013 income. So to track the four-year trend, as Burke did, you have to start with 2009 as a baseline and measure changes across 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. Burke’s camp did just that -- but there’s a problem with the method, as we shall see in a moment. Here’s what the survey reported: Year Median household income Dollar change Percent change 2009 $54,210 2010 $52,317 -$1,893 -3.5% 2011 $52,111 -$206 -0.4% 2012 $51,649 -$462 -0.9% 2013 $51,467 -$182 -0.3% 2009-’13 -$2,743 -5.1% Source: American Community Survey That $2,743 drop was big enough drop to be statistically significant, even when considering the survey’s margin of error, census officials told us. And Burke describes it as "nearly $3,000" -- a characterization generally on target, though that $257 difference is not insubstantial. There’s trouble here, though, for Burke. She associates Walker, and Walker alone, with the four-year period she discusses. That sounds reasonable on the surface; the governor’s term is four years, and it’s ending. But there’s no 2014 data yet, so to get four full years Burke has to dip back into the final year (2010) of Walker’s Democratic predecessor, Gov. Jim Doyle. In other words, the census data she cites covers one year from the Doyle era and three years of Walker’s time. Indeed, most of the income drop Burke cites was in 2010, Doyle’s final year, when the median household income fell $1,893 or 3.5 percent. The drop under Walker, in his first three years, amounts to $850, or 1.6 percent. The blame game on economic matters is tricky under the best circumstances. The lingering effects of the national recession, Walker’s cuts to public workers’ disposable income, his tax cuts, the below-average pace of job creation, the national economy -- all those factors and more play into fluctuations in income. But in this instance Burke blames Walker for something that largely occurred before his watch, providing a distorted view for voters. Our rating Saying that his approach hasn’t worked, Burke blamed Walker for income losses, saying, "the typical Wisconsin family has actually seen their real income drop by nearly $3,000 in the last four years." While median household income in Wisconsin has fallen $2,743 in four years, most of the drop occurred before Walker took office in 2011, We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-05034	The United States can immediately tap a domestic energy resource of "more than 1.5 trillion barrels of oil, six times more than Saudi Arabia."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jul/12/eric-hovde/eric-hovde-says-us-has-six-times-more-oil-saudi-ar/	As Wisconsinites geared up to hit the highway for the Fourth of July, Republican U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde declared American energy independence as easy as 1, 2, 3. Here’s the solution to high gas prices and overreliance on foreign oil, a Hovde campaign news release said on July 2, 2012: 1. "Immediately tap into America’s natural resources: More than 1.5 trillion barrels of oil (six times more than Saudi Arabia); 272 trillion cubic feet of natural gas; and more than half the world’s oil shale supply." 2. "End the moratorium on domestic drilling on public lands." 3. "Build the Keystone XL pipeline." There has been much debate about drilling on public lands and the Keystone XL pipeline, which would move oil sands crude from Canada to Gulf of Mexico refineries. But there’s been little discussion of the claim that America has an untapped domestic oil source that tops oil-rich Saudi Arabia by a factor of six. Is Hovde right? Hovde’s campaign pointed us to the Republican website for the House Natural Resources Committee, chaired by U.S. Rep. Doc Hastings (R-Washington). "According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) the U.S. holds more than half of the world’s oil shale resources," the site says. "The most recent estimates (April, 2009) show the region may hold more than 1.5 trillion barrels of oil – six times Saudi Arabia’s proven resources, and enough to provide the United States with energy for the next 200 years." Hovde, the committee website and the USGS are talking about the same thing -- the Green River Formation in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming. But each is using some critically different ways to describe it. The Green River Formation is considered the world’s largest oil shale resource, but only sporadic attempts have been made to explore it -- typically when oil prices spike. The reason: It’s not crude oil that lies beneath the surface, as in Saudi Arabia. It’s oil shale, a solid organic compound that can be converted to oil only when heated to great temperatures. The USGS made clear when it announced its findings in 2009. Huge obstacles including costs, technology and environmental concerns have stood in the way. Let’s start with the non-partisan source, the Geological Survey. Pressed by Congress during a gas-price spike several years ago, the survey analyzed the oil shale resource and determined the Colorado section of the formation by far the most promising. They estimated that 1.525 trillion barrels of "in-place oil shale resources" lie in the Colorado section. That’s the number Hovde and the Republican website mention. But each shortens that to "oil" -- and that’s a big difference. The Geological Survey describes oil shale as "pre oil" because it is not ready-made crude. And the agency’s assessment made an important point: No economically viable extraction method is currently available in the United States, because the process is so technologically and environmentally challenging compared to conventional extraction of actual crude oil. "Much of the resource in Colorado, where the richest deposits of high grade oil shale exist, are buried deep enough that mining is considered impractical or prohibitively difficult and expensive," said Justin Birdwell, a USGS research engineer studying the resource, in an interview. The focus, therefore has been on underground processing technologies, which are unproven. Given this backdrop, the agency concluded in 2009 that it’s unknown how much of that 1.5 trillion barrels is recoverable. That’s still true today, although the agency is developing estimates. Recovery of oil is years or decades away, certainly not "immediate" as Hovde described it. Additionally, when it comes to the Saudi Arabia comparison, Hovde runs into a major apples-to-oranges problem when he says the 1.5 trillion "barrels of oil" in the Green River Formation is "six times more" than in Saudi Arabia. He is comparing Saudi Arabia’s 266 billion of "proved resources" with the 1.5 trillion in the Green River Formation -- but the latter number is only an estimate of the total "in-place" in the formation, without regard to the ability to get it out or get a viable price for it. It’s a "major distinction," as a Congressional Research Service paper on US fossil fuel resources noted in 2010. "Proved reserves are those amounts of oil, natural gas, or coal that have been discovered and defined, typically by drilling wells or other exploratory measures, and which can be economically recovered," the study said. In terms of proved reserves, the US has 20.7 billion barrels -- 13 times less than Saudi Arabia, according to the latest data from the Energy Information Administration, a US government agency. The Republican website Hovde cites was more precise and cautious than the candidate. It said the region "may hold" more than 1.5 trillion barrels, and explicitly compared that to the Saudi’s "proven" resources. Hovde omitted the qualifiers. In any case, according to two Congressional Research Service studies, oil shale "makes poor feedstock for making gasoline, so it might primarily be a source of other liquid middle distillate fuels such as jet fuel or diesel oil, fuels for which there is significant national demand." Finally, Hovde’s claim reminded us of a February 2012 item by PolitiFact National that rated Mostly False a claim by Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich. He said that by one estimate the United States may have "three times as much oil in the United States as there is in Saudi Arabia." That item noted the same apples-to-oranges problem in the comparison. Our rating Hovde suggested that we immediately tap into America’s natural resources, which he said are "more than 1.5 trillion barrels of oil (six times more than Saudi Arabia)." Hovde referred to a massive western United States formation of oil shale, and there’s a kernel of truth in that government officials estimate that 1.5 trillion barrels are contained there. But Hovde omits a critical fact: He’s comparing that uncertain oil shale resource with Saudi oil reserves that have been discovered and defined and can be extracted economically. It’s unknown what the western formation will yield, and it certainly won’t come immediately. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-01578	The United States has "the highest corporate tax rate in the free world."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/09/eric-bolling/does-us-have-highest-corporate-tax-rate-free-world/	Pundits don’t just disagree about what tax rates should be; they also disagree about how high they actually are. On Fox News’s The Five, hosts Bob Beckel and Eric Bolling came down on either side while discussing how the economy has fared under President Barack Obama. America has "the most number of deductions available to corporations," Beckel said. "They pay lower taxes than a lot of European countries do, and under Obama, I have not seen corporate taxes go up all that much." "Just to fact-check you a little bit," responded Bolling, "we have the highest corporate tax rate in the free world." Beckel repeated his point, then Bolling pointed towards Pfizer and Burger King going overseas for what he called "tax inversion." "They’re going there specifically to capture a lower corporate income tax," said Bolling. We separately checked Beckel’s claim about deductions, but in this check, we’ll see whether Bolling is correct that the United States’ corporate tax rate ranks as the highest in "the free world." The rate in theory We decided to focus on the countries that belong to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, a group that includes most advanced, industrialized nations. That fits our bill for a proxy for "the free world." Out of the 34 countries in the OECD, America ranks first with a 39.1 percent corporate tax rate, compared to an OECD average of 24.1 percent. The OECD figure is what’s called the statutory rate, meaning the base rate applied to corporate profits. According to the Tax Foundation, two non-OECD countries -- the United Arab Emirates (55 percent) and Chad (40 percent) -- have a greater statutory rate than the United States. But the UAE is governed by a monarchy and Chad is a developing country, so we don’t think they would fit into the "free world" category Bolling used. The rate in practice PolitiFact, our sister site, has looked at several variations on Bolling’s claim and ruled them Mostly True almost every time. The reason for the "mostly" qualifier is that companies aren’t actually taxed at the statutory rate. Tax deductions -- on health insurance, pensions, and investment returns, for example -- allow corporations to reduce the pool of taxable profits. So economists often look at what they call the effective tax rate, which experts have told us is just as valid a measurement of corporate tax rates as the statutory rate. But whereas the statutory rate is relatively straightforward and uncontroversial, different, reputable organizations have published very different estimates of the effective tax rate that corporations pay. The most recent estimate comes from the World Bank and International Finance Commission, which put the United States’ effective rate for 2014 at 27.9 percent. That’s second-highest behind New Zealand among OECD countries and 15th-highest among the 189 countries measured. In 2011, the Tax Foundation published a survey of 13 prior estimates of the United States’ effective tax rate from 2005 to 2011. All 13 studies pegged the U.S.’s rate as above average, but none had the U.S. rate first overall. Another 2011 study by the Congressional Research Service put the U.S. effective rate at 27.1 percent, slightly lower than the OECD average of 27.7 percent. Taxes are convoluted Different studies disagree on effective corporate tax rates because corporate tax rates tend to vary widely depending on the industry, said Alan Viola, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. "The biggest deduction that varies across countries is how generous the depreciation schedule is," said Alan Viard, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. "When a business does an investment, equipment, a building, they don’t normally get to deduct the whole cost that year. They have to do it over time." Faster is better, said Viard, but depreciation rates vary depending on what types of equipment a company is buying. Many studies also don’t account for what the United States classifies as S-corporations, meaning businesses that pay tax through the individual income-tax system rather than the corporate income-tax system, Viard said. This represents about 30 percent of American companies, he said. So while effective tax rates are a good estimate of the corporate tax burden in the United States, particular businesses’ burden may vary. Our ruling Bolling said the United States has "the highest corporate tax rate in the free world." He was referring to the statutory rate, meaning the rate before deductions. On that score, he’s right: The United States does have the highest statutory rate among developed countries. However, the United States’ corporate tax rate doesn’t appear to be the highest once deductions and other exclusions are taken into account. So Bolling is correct by one valid definition. Because his statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Eric Bolling	None	None	None	2014-09-09T11:01:09	2014-09-01	['United_States']
pomt-13487	Says Russian President Vladimir Putin "calls me brilliant."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/08/donald-trump/did-vladimir-putin-call-trump-brilliant/	Donald Trump defended his praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin during NBC’s Commander-in-Chief Forum, claiming he was only returning the favor. NBC host Matt Lauer listed some of the things Trump and Putin have said about each other, and asked if Trump wants admiration from someone who is at odds with U.S. foreign policy and may be meddling with the election. "You said, ‘I will tell you, in terms of leadership, he’s getting an A, our president is not doing so well. And when referring to a comment that Putin made about you, I think he called you a brilliant leader, you said, ‘It’s always a great honor to be so nicely complimented by a man so highly respected within his country and beyond,’ " Lauer said. "But do you want to be complimented by that former KBG officer?" "Well, I think when he calls me brilliant, I’ll take the compliment, OK?" Trump said, "The fact is, look, it’s not going to get him anywhere. I’m a negotiator." While Lauer and Trump both claimed that Putin called Trump "brilliant" during the forum, we are putting Trump’s statement on the Truth-O-Meter. It’s not the first time Trump has brought up the "really nice things" Putin has said about him. "He called me a genius," Trump said of Putin at two campaign events in February, three times in April, in a May interview on CNN, at a June rally in California, twice in July, and at an August town hall in Ohio Trump has been referring to comments Putin made in December 2015, when asked for his thoughts of the billionaire by an ABC reporter. "He’s a very colorful person. Talented, without any doubt, but it’s not our affair to determine our worthiness — that’s up to the United States voters. But he is absolutely the leader in the presidential race," reads the captions on the ABC video. The Russian president’s words got lost in translation in some corners of the American press. CNN, Buzzfeed, the Washington Examiner, the New York Post, The Hill all quoted Putin calling Trump "brilliant and talented." Translations from British and Russian media outlets, meanwhile, were closer to the original ABC video. Reuters reported that Putin called Trump "very flamboyant, very talented." The BBC interpreted the comments as "very colorful, talented." And The Guardian amended a previous version of its article from "brilliant" to "very colorful." RT, the television network funded by the Russian government, quoted Putin as saying "very flamboyant." And according to Sputnik, a news agency also controlled by the Kremlin, Putin said "very bright." What accounts for these different interpretations? The word Putin used was "яркий" or "yarkii," which means "bright" or "brilliant." But whereas "bright" and "brilliant" in English are synonyms for both "vivid" and "intelligent," the Russian word "yarkii" does not carry the second meaning. Putin was basically using "yarkii" to mean "colorful" or "strong personality," said Harley Balzer, a Russia expert at Georgetown University, adding that he sees "nothing to support ‘brilliant’" in the intelligence sense from the comments Putin made in December. Russian language experts told our friends at FactCheck.Org the same thing. Putin, himself, denied the "brilliant" translation in a June interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria. "You made some comments about the American Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump. You called him ‘brilliant,’ ‘outstanding,’ ‘talented,’ " Zakaria said. "These comments were reported around the world. I was wondering what in him led you to that judgment and do you still hold that judgment?" "Why do you always change the meaning of what I said?" Putin responded through an interpreter. "I only said that he was a ‘bright person.’ Isn’t he bright? He is. I did not say anything else about him." Our ruling Trump said Putin "calls me brilliant." This is an imprecise translation of Putin’s actual comments. The word he used was "yarkii," which means "bright" as in vivid or colorful, not intelligent or clever.

pomt-12369	"70 percent of Florida is in drought today."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2017/jun/05/al-gore/al-gore-says-70-percent-floridas-drought-today/	Former Vice President Al Gore said that the global community will have to continue to respond to climate change after President Donald Trump’s "reckless" decision to pull out of the Paris climate change agreement. Gore said that evidence abounds that climate change is real (it is ), and people "don’t have to rely on the virtually unanimous opinion of the scientific community anymore." "Mother nature is telling us every night on the TV news now is like a nature hike through the book of Revelation," Gore said on Fox News Sunday on June 4. "People are noticing this, these downpours and historic floods. We’ve had 11 once-in-a-thousand-year downpours in the U.S. just in the last 10 years. We’ve got these wildfires that become mega fires now. Seventy percent of Florida is in drought today. Missouri declared an emergency just a couple of days ago because of another one of these. And they keep on coming." Gore correctly cited a drought figure for Florida from a commonly used drought index. We will explain what that index shows and what the drought means in Florida. Most of Florida is in a drought A spokeswoman for Gore said that he was citing the United States Drought Monitor, a weekly map published on Thursdays showing drought conditions. The monitor, established in 1999, is produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The map is based on measurements of climatic, hydrologic and soil conditions as well as reported impacts and observations from more than 350 contributors around the country. The monitor showed that 71.66 percent of Florida was in a moderate to extreme drought as of May 30. (The previous few weeks it had been between 65 and 66.) See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com While that was the highest this year, there have been multiple other weeks that it reached similarly high levels since 2000. The last time the drought monitor showed Florida’s area of drought was as high as 71 percent was February 2013. As bad as this drought is, it’s been even worse. During two weeks in April 2012, 99.96 percent of Florida was in a drought. More than 72 percent of Florida was in a drought between late January and early June 2012. There was also an extended period of drought between December 2010 and July 2011 and between April and August 2007. There were also periods of drought in 2000-01. Florida’s dry season runs from about November through May and can leave Florida prone to drought conditions. If the dry season is drier than usual and the wet season is late to appear, a period of drought can run into summer, said Victor Murphy, climate service program manager for NOAA's National Weather Service-Southern Region. There is a small bit of good news: The return of the rainy season — under way this first week of June — should improve drought conditions. "There have been at least three other instances in the past 10 years when this has occurred," Murphy said. "Not coincidentally, all of these events began in the winter/spring (dry) season, and ended during the summer. This event will be similar. "Since the Florida wet season has returned with a vengeance over the past week, and is forecast to continue over the next few weeks, the amount of Florida in drought two to four weeks from now should be substantially less than what it is today." Gore tied in several weather events to illustrate the effects of climate change. Experts told us that Florida is prone to periodic droughts, but rising temperatures as a result of climate change can make droughts worse. "It’s part of the climate -- part of natural cycles," said David Zierden, the state climatologist for Florida who works at the Florida Climate Center at Florida State University. "Our current drought is no worse or more prolonged than any other drought we go through periodically." This year the Florida Peninsula only received half of its normal rainfall during the dry season, leading to the most active wildfire season since 2011. Temperatures have been rising in Florida -- the statewide average temperature for 26 of the last 27 months have all been warmer than normal, Zierden said. "There is an increasing temperature trend, and warmer temperatures lead to greater evapotranspiration rates, which can exacerbate these periods of drought," Zierden said. (Gore’s spokeswoman pointed to an article by the Union of Concerned Scientists that makes a similar point.) While Gore’s numerical statement about the drought is correct, David Nolan, chair of the University of Miami’s Department of Atmospheric Sciences, cautioned against pointing to any particular weather event as proof of climate change. "I am generally not comfortable with relating any local event, a drought in one place or a flood in another, to global warming," Nolan said. "What matters most is global average temperature, because that drives sea level rise, which eventually will be the biggest problem." Our ruling Gore said "70 percent of Florida is in drought today." Gore correctly cited the United States Drought Monitor which showed that 71.66 percent of Florida was experiencing a drought for the week ending May 30. However, that drought percentage isn’t unheard of in Florida -- there have been other periods of drought since 2000 when the monitor began mapping drought data. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-02944	$6 billion water bond program voters passed in 2011 "has yet to be tapped."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/oct/29/independent-texans/water-board-hasnt-tapped-6-billion-lending-authori/	Meeting Texas’ water demands will cost $231 billion by 2060, Texas’ water plan says. Much of that is maintenance and repair, but new water projects will cost $53 billion, and local governments report they’ll need state help to borrow half of that. Yet the Independent Texans political action committee says Texas hasn’t even started using a $6 billion program voters approved in 2011 to help finance water projects. For that and other reasons, the PAC opposes the $2 billion water fund Proposition 6 that Texans will vote on Nov. 5, 2013, according to its white paper published online Sept. 3, 2013. "Texas voters passed Prop 2 in 2011, with a narrow 1.5% margin," the PAC said. "At the time, voters were assured by Prop 2 supporters ...that the $6B evergreen bonding authority would build critical local water supply projects, create jobs and protect us from drought and wildfire without taxpayer contribution. Yet, the $6B bond program has yet to be tapped. "The same supporters now say we must ‘act in concert’ with the Prop 2 bonding authority by infusing $2B of seed money to make the 2011 program work." As it turns out, it’s correct that the state water board hasn’t started using the permission voters granted in 2011 to borrow $6 billion. But why -- and what does that mean for Prop 6? The Texas Water Development Board, created in 1957 after a decade-long drought that ruined thousands of Texas farmers and ranchers, lends money at low rates to communities for local water and wastewater projects, such as reservoirs and pipelines. The board raises money to offer such loans by selling bonds -- basically, big IOU notes that the state eventually pays off. State lawmakers and voters tell the board how many bonds it can sell. The last two rounds of authorization came in 2001, when voters gave permission for the board to issue $2 billion in bonds, and 2011, when voters approved an "evergreen" lending cap of $6 billion -- as long as the total amount loaned out never exceeds $6 billion, the board can keep lending without coming back for new authorizations. But again, those are limits, not actual dollars. To date, the board has issued $1.6 billion under 2001’s $2 billion authority, spokeswoman Merry Klonower told us by phone. The board has committed to but not closed on another $173,000 in loans, so the board can set up $187,000 more in loans before it starts using the $6 billion lending cap, she said. The board had predicted in 2011 that it would run out of the 2001 authority in one to two years, Klonower said, and chose not to wait until the Legislature’s next meeting in 2013 to ask for more. "You don’t want to get to the end of it and start turning communities away," she said. An Aug. 30, 2011, fact sheet from the board said that of $3.29 billion in loans since 1957, $1 billion had been lent in the past three years. "The TWDB estimates that its existing bond authority will be exhausted within the next one to two years," and Prop 2 would provide needed authority beyond that, it said. In other words, the board never expected to start using the $6 billion authority until about 2013, according to the agency. It was seeking permission to make those loans in the future. Independent Texans’ white paper said the $6 billion authority had not been tapped because it doesn’t provide incentives including low interest rates and deferred payments. The pace at which the board issued loans slowed after 2010, and lack of such incentives was one reason why, Klonower and House Natural Resources Committee director Elizabeth Fazio told us by phone and email. Water board list of loans Nov. 2011-Oct. 2013 Received Oct. 23, 2013, from water board Fazio, who serves as the staff to legislators on the committee, explained by phone that the water board can’t make a loan unless two things happen. First, a city or other local entity has to apply, and second, the state has to have a guarantee that the loan payments can be made even if the local government defaults (which none have in the board’s history). With general obligation bonds for water projects, Fazio said, the state provided this guarantee itself in 2007 and 2009 by designating enough general revenue cash to cover the payments. Once that money is dedicated, the board can also use it to make the loan terms better for local governments. For example, the board can buy down the interest rate or offer to make the first loan payments for the local entity, until its water project is operational and has paying customers. But general revenue to do that hasn’t matched up with the demand for loans, Fazio said. "Where there has been a dedication it has been very limited." Klonower said that when the board was able to offer incentives, the demand for loans "far exceeded the amount of funds available." Incentives aren’t the only factor in communities’ decisions to take on water projects, though, she said; the economy and drought conditions weigh in, too. Proposition 6 is intended to provide a stable source of money for such incentives -- namely, a $2 billion chunk of cash that would be transferred out of the state’s rainy day fund. With that money, the board would provide its own guarantees and incentives instead of counting on general revenue being designated for those purposes, as the Legislature did in 2007 and 2009 but did not during the 2011 budget crunch. If the proposal works as planned, state Rep. Allan Ritter, R-Nederland, who wrote the House legislation, has said it could fund a total of $27 billion in projects over coming decades, because the state could continue lending out money for projects as earlier loans are paid back. Our ruling Independent Texans said that the $6 billion bond program approved by voters in 2011 "has yet to be tapped." That’s correct, but the water board didn’t expect to tap into it for a year or two. The pace of lending has slowed, partly because of the lack of incentives the group mentions, but the board is still making loans. We rate this statement, which lacks these clarifications, as Mostly True.	None	Independent Texans	None	None	None	2013-10-29T16:50:47	2013-09-03	['None']
pomt-12201	"We had the best jobs report in 16 years."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/25/donald-trump/donald-trump-right-us-just-had-best-jobs-report-16/	During a speech before tens of thousands of Boy Scouts at the group’s quadrennial Jamboree, President Donald Trump took a moment to tout his economic achievements as president. "I'll tell you what, we are indeed making America great again," Trump said. "What's going on is incredible. We had the best jobs report in 16 years." Trump, as a candidate, regularly bashed the low unemployment rates under President Barack Obama as making the national jobs picture look better than it actually was. Now he says the economy is surging, and the numbers show it. Does he have a point now? When we checked with the White House, they referred us to a Bloomberg article headlined, "Pickup in Confidence Shows Americans Upbeat on Jobs, Economy." The article notes that "unemployment (is) near a 16-year low." Indeed, today’s unemployment rate -- 4.4 percent -- is tied for the lowest in the past 16 years, going back to June 2001. There were four other months prior to Trump’s presidency that matched today’s rate, and it was slightly lower -- 4.3 percent -- a month earlier, during Trump’s own presidency. Here’s a chart. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com That said, the term "jobs report" refers to a monthly news release by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the unemployment rate is only one of two headline numbers in those reports. The other one is the gain or loss in jobs compared to the previous month’s number. That second number, while solid, is not "the best" in 16 years. According to the June 2017 report, the economy gained 222,000 jobs. That’s the 52nd-best monthly performance out of the 193 months since June 2001. Here’s a chart: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Meanwhile, there are a number of lower-profile statistics in every jobs report. Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, noted that one of these measurements -- the ratio of employed people to the population as a whole -- remains stuck well below its pre-Great Recession highs. Here’s a chart: Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist, said the shrinkage in the number of jobs created per month should be taken with a grain of salt, since the country is approaching full employment. Overall, Burtless said, "employment has kept rising and involuntary unemployment has been falling for about seven years, and that pattern has persisted thus far in the Trump administration." Finally, it’s worth noting, as we always do, that no president can take full credit for the economy’s achievements (or its shortcomings). Many other factors, including the health of the rest of the world economy and changes in demographics and technology, play a role as well. This is especially true for a president just six months into his tenure, following years of improvement under his predecessor. Our ruling Trump said that "we had the best jobs report in 16 years" in the most recent monthly release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate, one of two key figures in the monthly release, is near its 16-year low. But while the other major statistic in the report -- the job-gains figure -- is hardly unprecedented over the same period, experts say that’s not surprising, given where the country is in the current economic cycle.

pomt-04244	"More Tennesseans have hunting and fishing licenses than vote."	false	/tennessee/statements/2012/nov/18/lamar-alexander/lamar-alexander-says-more-tennesseeans-have-huntin/	In what was a busy post-election week for Sen. Lamar Alexander -- holding hearings on the meningitis outbreaks and passing the bipartisan PREEMIE Act to prevent infant mortality -- the office of Tennessee’s senior Republican issued a news release to announce a vote "to support S. 3525, the Sportsmen’s bill." A lot of Tennesseans love to hunt and fish, and the release noted that Alexander supported the bill because it "increases hunting and fishing access to federal lands while reauthorizing several conservation programs." The news release’s headline put it another way: "Keep hunting and fishing without burdensome regulations, while protecting our wetlands and wildlife." Those claims fall into the category of opinion, but the quote provided from Alexander asserted a statement of fact -- and one he’s used before: "More Tennesseans have hunting and fishing licenses than vote." We know hunting and fishing are popular, but, fresh off the 2012 election, we were aware that more than 2.4 million votes were cast in Tennessee on Nov. 6. Given that Tennessee has a population of 6.4 million, that would mean that some one-third of all Tennesseans -- just fewer than half of whom are men -- have hunting and fishing licenses. The senator’s office said it was basing the Tennesseans who vote number on the Nov. 2, 2010, midterm election, in which 1,620,542 votes were cast, because that was the most recent election for which official certified results were available. For the hunting and fishing licenses, Alexander’s office pointed to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services reports from 2004, in which it added 727,525 from the hunting license report of 2003 numbers to the 992,727 from the fishing license report of 2003 numbers to come up with 1,720,252. When we contacted the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, we discovered that hunting and fishing licenses are renewable on a yearly basis. Another key point -- most of the Tennessee licenses are what as known as Type 1: Hunting and Fishing Combo. That allows for fishing and hunting of small game, and TWRA press officer Lee Wilmot said that, for 2012, there had been 373,562 such licenses issued. Those hunting larger game, like deer, purchase a Type 4: Annual Sportsman, and 61,284 have been issued for 2012. Throw in the 32,205 Type 2: Youth licenses, the 18,146 Type 166: Permanent Senior Citizen licenses and Type 167: Resident Annual Senior Citizen licenses and you get to 486,416 hunting and fishing licenses issued in Tennessee for 2012. That number is well short of even the 1,620,542 votes cast in November of 2010 in Tennessee, and it’s even further away from the unofficial, non-certified count of 2,454,470 votes in the recent Nov. 6 election and the 2,599,749 votes cast in the 2008 presidential election in Tennessee. More than 2.4 million voted in the 2004 presidential election. Sen. Alexander reached out to us directly and acknowledged that he should have qualified the quote more carefully to make it clear that he was referring to the number votes cast in the 2010 election. The discrepancy in numbers between actual licenses issued from 2012 and the 2003 numbers shown in that federal report appear to be related to how states are allowed to report to the federal agency. A note on the state site, for instance, says Tennessee issues the dual hunting and fishing "combo" license in part to maximize statistics used to receive federal funding. We did find a more recent U.S. Fish and Wildlife report, from 2012, that looked closely at numbers of sportsmen and outdoor enthusiasts in 2011. It did not list licenses, but instead relied on the U.S. Bureau of Census to help make scientific estimates. In its "Table 4: Anglers and Hunters by Sportsperson’s State of Residence for 2011," the report’s number for Tennessee is 923,000. Again, well short of votes cast by Tennesseans in the 2010 midterm elections, and nowhere close to the number of votes cast in any of the three most recent presidential elections. Our ruling We do not disagree with Sen. Alexander’s point that hunting and fishing remain popular in Tennessee, but his statement that more Tennesseans have hunting and fishing licenses than vote is not supported by the most recent and most reliable numbers. There are more voters in Tennessee than sportsmen, so we rule this statement False.	None	Lamar Alexander	None	None	None	2012-11-18T04:00:00	2012-11-13	['None']

Ted Cruz of Texas portrays Democratic nominee Beto O’Rourke, who represents El Paso in the U.S. House, as careless about border security. A TV ad from the Texans Are PAC that we spotted on Austin’s Fox 7 Sept. 12, 2018, associates O’Rourke, who opposes the border-long wall sought by Republicans led by President Donald Trump, with taxpayer-funded benefits for immigrants and "sanctuary cities," a term that usually refers to communities that deter local law officers from asking individuals to share their immigration status. The ad’s narrator follows up the mention of O’Rourke’s support for sanctuary cities by saying, about O’Rourke, "while voting against border armor for Texas sheriffs patrolling the border." The ad also shows these words on screen: "No body armor for Texas sheriffs." A 2014 House vote Fine print below the ad’s mention of sheriffs and body armor helped us start our factual review. It said the claim about denying body armor to border sheriffs ties to an O’Rourke vote in June 2014 on the "Grayson Amendment." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Separately, we noticed, Cruz’s campaign posted a press release in May 2018 mentioning the June 19, 2014, vote on the amendment. In that House-posted vote, O’Rourke was among 62 members (counting 43 Democrats) to vote for the amendment from then-Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Florida, which was rejected by 355 members (including 145 Democrats). Cruz’s release said "O’Rourke voted in favor of a bill that would prevent funding for the Defense Department’s Excess Personal Property Program." The release said the program had provided law enforcement in the El Paso area with more than $9 million in equipment, including 156 units of body armor for the sheriff’s office; 90 night vision units for the local border patrol; helicopters for the city police and border patrol; and other items such as trauma gear, fencing and generators. According to the Defense Logistics Agency, which oversees the program, more than 8,000 federal and state law enforcement agencies participate. "Law enforcement agencies use the equipment in a variety of ways," the agency says. "For instance, four-wheel drive vehicles are used to interrupt drug harvesting, haul away marijuana, patrol streets and conduct surveillance. The 1033 Program also helps with the agencies’ general equipment needs, such as file cabinets, copiers and fax machines that they need but perhaps are unable to afford." Our web search for more information about the roll-call vote cited in the Texans Are ad led us to the text of Grayson’s failed amendment to the Defense Department’s appropriations act. That text forbade expenditures toward aircraft, tanks and weaponry provided from the personal property program to local law enforcement--but it made no mention of body armor. Let’s get specific: Grayson’s amendment said that no funds made available by the act "may be used to transfer aircraft (including unmanned aerial vehicles), armored vehicles, grenade launchers, silencers, toxicological agents (including chemical agents, biological agents, and associated equipment), launch vehicles, guided missiles, ballistic missiles, rockets, torpedoes, bombs, mines, or nuclear weapons (as identified for demilitarization purposes outlined in Department of Defense Manual 4160.28) through the" personal property program. Via the C-SPAN video archive, we watched Grayson present his proposal, which he said would restrict the Defense Department from militarizing community police agencies. Military weapons, he said, "have no place in our streets regardless of who may be deploying them." Two Republican members spoke in opposition before Grayson’s proposal was rejected. "We welcome this equipment; it’s not misused," Rep. Rodney Frelilnghuysen, R-N.J., said. Texans Are leader notes another House vote After we’d scoured the cited amendment, Jason Johnson, who runs the PAC, told us by email that the proposed restriction indeed extended to denying body armor to border sheriffs. He didn’t say how. After we published this fact-check, we learned from the DLA that it stopped providing body armor to local jurisdictions years before the O'Rourke vote on Grayson's amendment. Spokeswoman Michelle McCaskill advised by email that the program "stopped providing body armor in 2008. When DLA Disposition Services receives excess body armor from the military services, it is destroyed. What we do provide," McCaskill wrote, "are tactical vests but without the body armor inserted in them. Law enforcement can purchase body armor with their own funds or with federal grant money." Earlier, Johnson also told us that in June 2014, O’Rourke voted against an amendment to the 2016 Defense Authorization Act successfully offered by Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, "that included border security activities on the list of preferred applications the Defense Department should consider when transferring excess property to other federal agencies." We turned to the Congressional Record transcript of that debate to learn that for the purposes of border security, McCaul’s amendment placed the Department of Homeland Security on equal footing with other law-enforcement agencies in access to Defense Department excess equipment. The transcript shows that neither the amendment nor House floor debate touched on body armor for border sheriffs. O’Rourke spoke in opposition to McCaul's amendment, it further shows, by saying DHS already had access to such equipment which, he said, wasn’t needed on the border anyway. O’Rourke said we "do not need to militarize the border" and he said the amendment creates "further anxiety and fear about the border at a time that is not warranted," according to the transcript. The transcript shows O’Rourke ultimately requested a record (rather than voice) vote on the amendment. In that roll call vote, O’Rourke was among 162 Democrats and four Republicans voting "no" while McCaul was among 235 Republicans plus 18 Democrats voting "aye." Our ruling Texans Are said O’Rourke voted against providing body armor to Texas sheriffs patrolling the border. In 2014, O’Rourke voted in favor of barring the Defense Department from providing excess aircraft, tanks and military weaponry to local law agencies in general. However, the proposed restriction did not extend to body armor and made no mention of border sheriffs. Contrary to the ad's claim, there was no up-or-down vote on providing body armor to Texas sheriffs patrolling the border. We rate this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

UPDATE, 10:07 a.m., Sept. 21, 2018: We revised this story to add the DLA's advisory that it had stopped providing body armor to local law enforcement agencies years before the House vote singled out by Texans Are. This addition didn't affect our rating of the claim.	None	Texans Are	None	None	None	2018-09-13T16:55:44	2018-09-12	['Texas']
pomt-04210	"If you and I fail to defund ObamaCare now, some 16,000 new IRS agents will be begin prying into our private medical records, eyeing each and every one of our treatments and prescriptions for "violations’."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2012/dec/02/association-mature-american-citizens/association-mature-american-citizens-says-under-af/	One of the main themes that drives the opposition to President Obama’s health-care overhaul is the idea of the federal government muscling its way into individuals’ private health decisions. One of the favored images in those arguments is the specter of 16,000 newly hired agents from the Internal Revenue Service sweeping in to enforce the law’s rules and regulations. It was evoked in a letter one of our readers received last month from Daniel C. Weber, president and founder of the Association of Mature American Citizens, which calls itself "the conservative alternative to the AARP." Our reader forwarded the letter to us. In his letter, Weber called for signatures on a petition to "defund" the Affordable Care Act, nicknamed Obamacare, and asked recipients to pay for a membership in his group ($16 per year, with discounts for multi-year memberships.) Among other things, Weber claimed that if the law is fully implemented, the federal government will hire 16,000 new IRS agents who "will begin prying into our private medical records, eyeing each and every one of our treatments and prescriptions for ‘violations.’ " We left e-mail and telephone messages for Weber with his organization, but weren’t able to reach him for comment. Politifact reporters and others around the country have been playing Whac-a-Mole with variations of this claim for a while now. PolitiFact National gave then-Illinois Republican U.S. Rep. (and later to be U.S. Sen.) Mark Kirk a Mostly Falseruling for saying in a March 21, 2010, speech on the House floor that the IRS would have to hire 16,000 employees "to audit the American people and impose the new taxes and mandates of the bill." PolitiFact National traced the origin of that number to a report from the Congressional Budget Office that said that, based on what it called incomplete estimates, the new law could wind up costing the IRS between $5 billion and $10 billion over the next 10 years. Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee took the high end of that incomplete estimate, $10 billion, divided it by the average IRS employee’s salary and came up with 16,500 additional "examiners, auditors and other employees." But the committee also noted it was "impossible to know" the exact number of new hires. PolitiFact rated the claim Mostly False because it incorrectly attributed the 16,500-employee figure directly to the CBO, took only the high end of an incomplete estimate and assumed all the money would go to staff and not for other costs, such as office overhead. A year later, U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga, added some new touches to the claim. In a March 28, 2011, letter he sent to a constituent, the 16,500 IRS employees became 16,500 agents enforcing the law. PolitiFact Georgia ruled his claim False. Despite two years of similar debunkings, the 16,000-agent claim not only survives, it’s morphing, as evidenced by Weber’s letter. In addition to repeating the number, he says the new agents will be investigating citizens’ private medical records. Is that true? In short, no. Here are the facts. The law requires individuals who don’t have health insurance to pay a financial penalty. The IRS envisions taxpayers getting a form from their insurance provider that certifies they have coverage, and then attaching that form to their federal tax return. If the taxpayer doesn’t have coverage, the IRS will be responsible for collecting any penalties. How that collection is to be enforced is unclear because the law strips the agency of the ability to impose criminal and civil penalties, such as liens on property. As far as Weber’s claim that the IRS would be investigating taxpayer’s medical procedures, Commissioner Douglas H. Shulman has said the agency’s only interest is in the yes-or-no question of whether a taxpayer has coverage, not what procedures, if any, it covered. "We expect to get a simple form that we won’t look behind that says this person has acceptable health coverage," Shulman told a House Ways and Means subcommittee on March 25, 2010. "There are not going to be any discussions about health coverage with an IRS employee." "The role of the IRS is going to be, again, the tax portions of this," he said, "not the health portions of this." Our Ruling Dan Weber, president of the Association of Mature American Citizens, said in a widely circulated letter that under the federal health overhaul, 16,000 new IRS agents will be "prying into our private medical records." Weber’s letter recycled arguments that have been repeatedly found to be untrue -- and added a new and equally untrue element. Pants on Fire.

pomt-07993	"Martin Luther King Jr. was a Republican!"	false	/texas/statements/2011/jan/17/raging-elephants/houston-group-says-martin-luther-king-jr-was-repub/	Raging Elephants, a Houston-based group involved in unsuccessful efforts to stop GOP state Rep. Joe Straus from winning another turn as Texas House speaker, says on its website that it's dedicated to bringing more "Americans of color" to the ranks of conservative voters. Posted on the site is a video of a speech by the group's leader, Apostle Claver Kamau-Imani, titled "Apostle Claver tells the world how the real party of racism is the Democrats." Also on the site, the group claims: "Martin Luther King Jr. was a Republican!" We weren't aware that the late civil rights leader ever expressed a partisan affiliation. Yet, we discovered, Republican groups have previously declared King one of their own. In 2006, the Sarasota, Fla.-based National Black Republican Association ran radio ads in Washington, D.C.; Georgia; Maryland; Ohio; and Pennsylvania including the statement that King was a Republican, according to an Oct. 19, 2006, Washington Post news story. And in 2008, according to news reports, the same group — whose website says it "is dedicated to promoting the traditional values of the black community, which are in concert with the core Republican Party philosophy of strong families, personal responsibility, quality education and equal opportunities for all" — paid for eight billboards bearing that message in Florida and South Carolina, as well as 50 billboards in Denver during the Democratic National Convention, where Barack Obama became the party's presidential nominee. In July 2009, Raging Elephants made the same claim on a Houston billboard, according to a July 14, 2009, news article on the Fox News Channel's website and a July 9, 2009, column in the Houston Chronicle. Kamau-Imani told FoxNews.com that the purpose of the billboard was to get blacks to rethink their political affiliation; African Americans typically vote for Democrats. "We think it's imperative that (the GOP) try and attract more people from the communities of color to vote their values — to vote conservative," Kamau-Imani told FoxNews.com. The King message has drawn objections. In Houston, the Fox News story says, local activist Quanell X held a news conference to speak out against the sign. Earlier, an Associated Press news article about the billboards posted in Florida reported that the chairman of the Florida Legislative Black Caucus, Democratic state Rep. Joe Gibbons, called the statement ridiculous. "To make a claim without presenting proof is bogus," he is quoted as saying in the July 4, 2008, story. Frances Rice, chairwoman of the National Black Republican Association, was quoted by the Post in 2006 as saying that the backlash from the radio ads was so great that she stopped answering telephone calls. But she stood by the claim that King was a Republican. "We were all Republicans in those days," she told the Post. "The Democrats were training fire hoses on us, siccing dogs on us." The Post story says it's correct that Southern Democrats "blocked the social and political progress of black Southerners for decades." When we asked Raging Elephants for information to support its claim that King himself was a Republican, Kamau-Imani pointed us to a video made by the National Black Republican Association featuring one of King's nieces, Alveda King, founder of the faith-based group King for America. In the Sept. 14, 2008, video, she says: "I just want to share with you a little bit about my family and my history. My uncle Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. during his lifetime was a Republican, as was my father, his brother, Rev. A. D. King, and my grandfather, Dr. Martin Luther King Sr." She adds: "The Republican Party historically has supported the rights of the oppressed. During the times of slavery, many of the abolitionists were Republicans." Our attempts to contact Alveda King were unsuccessful. Next, we sought historical expertise, including by asking Thomas Jackson, a history professor at the University of North Carolina-Greensboro and author of From Civil Rights to Human Rights: Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Struggle for Economic Justice, for his take on the video. He told us that Alveda King's description of the Republican Party's history was on the mark. "The Party of (Abraham) Lincoln defended black rights most vocally in the 1860s and 1870s, then abandoned the cause when the Democrats and the (Ku Klux) Klan defeated Republican state governments in the South. Blacks started their historic switch to the Democrats during the New Deal," which were economic programs implemented in the 1930s under President Franklin Roosevelt in response to the Great Depression. But Jackson said that he would not consider King a Republican, calling him instead a " 'tax and spend' democratic socialist." "He wanted the nation to spend billions of dollars directly to employ the unemployed when the private sector failed, and a vigorous mixture of affirmative action and anti-poverty programs championed by the liberal-left, and targeted federal spending in impoverished areas, especially the nation's slums," Jackson said. David Garrow — author of Bearing the Cross: Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which won the 1987 Pulitzer Prize for biography — advised against assigning King to either party. "It's simply incorrect to call Dr. King a Republican," Garrow told us. However, he said he wouldn't call King a Democrat, either, because he had "very positive feelings" about Republican Richard Nixon in the late 1950s and "extremely positive feelings" about Republican Nelson Rockefeller, the New York governor who later served as vice president. Also, Garrow said, King became "a very harsh critic" of Democratic President Lyndon Johnson over his escalation of the Vietnam War and "wouldn't necessarily have backed (Democratic presidential nominee) Hubert Humphrey in '68 had he (King) lived." We asked Garrow about the 2006 Post article's statements that King had voted for Democratic presidential candidates John F. Kennedy in 1960 and Lyndon Johnson in 1964. He said there is little doubt that King did so. But that doesn't mean King made public his political preferences. In his book, Garrow writes that during the 1960 race between Kennedy and Republican Richard Nixon, King declined to endorse either nominee — even after Kennedy associates interceded with officials in Georgia to help secure King's release from jail on a probation violation. The closest King came to that was a few days before the election when he released a statement that said: "I want to make it palpably clear that I am deeply grateful to Senator Kennedy for the genuine concern he expressed. ... (He) exhibited moral courage of a high order." King's father, however, was so grateful to Kennedy that he announced he was shifting his traditionally Republican presidential preference to vote for Kennedy, according to Garrow's book. King was more vocal about the candidates in the 1964 presidential election, when Johnson faced GOP nominee Barry Goldwater, who as an Arizona senator had voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Garrow told us that King "certainly did all but explicitly endorse LBJ in '64 and strongly criticize the Goldwater candidacy." Garrow writes in Bearing the Cross that King urged his supporters to vote against Goldwater and all GOP candidates who did not disassociate from him. According to the King Online Encyclopedia, from Stanford University's Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute, King campaigned for Johnson and welcomed his win. Next, we wondered what the King Center in Atlanta, founded by King's wife, the late Coretta Scott King, had to say about his partisanship. In 2008, Steve Klein, the center's communications director, told the National Journal that "there is absolutely no confirmation that (King) was a Republican. ... He was never a member of any political party — and never formally endorsed any candidates." Klein noted Coretta Scott King's recall of a 1960 phone call from Kennedy when her husband was in jail. In her book, My Life With Martin Luther King, Jr., she wrote that she took the call but was later unsure what to say about it. "My husband had a policy of not endorsing presidential candidates," her book says. "And at this point, I did not want to get him or myself identified with either party." The 2008 AP story about the Florida and South Carolina billboards included a statement from King's son, Martin Luther King III: "It is disingenuous to imply that my father was a Republican. He never endorsed any presidential candidate, and there is certainly no evidence that he ever even voted for a Republican. It is even more outrageous to suggest that he would support the Republican Party of today, which has spent so much time and effort trying to suppress African American votes in Florida and many other states." Friends and associates of Martin Luther King Jr. also objected. The AP article says that the Rev. Joseph Lowery, who co-founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference with King, "said there is no reason why anyone would think King was a Republican." Lowery told the AP that King almost certainly voted for Kennedy and that the only time he openly talked about politics was when he criticized Goldwater in 1964. The story quotes Lowery as saying: "That was not the Martin I know, and I don't think they can substantiate that by any shape, form or fashion. It's purely propaganda and poppycock. ... Even if he was, he would have nothing to do with what the Republican Party stands for today." Finally, we checked with political experts in the states where King spent most of his adulthood. Charles Bullock, a political science professor at the University of Georgia, said King "didn't die a Republican." But Bullock speculated that King could have been Republican in his youth when Southern Democrats were intensely segregationist. William Stewart, a political scientist at the University of Alabama, said that if King was a Republican, he kept it a secret. King focused on civil rights, Stewart said, and "partisan politics wasn't relevant." Upshot: Raging Elephants points to a King family member whose declaration lends support for its claim that King was a Republican: his niece Alveda. We didn't divine how she reached that conclusion. Another King relative, his son, disagrees, as do respected academic experts and former King associates and friends. The record shows that as a civil rights leader, King avoided partisan identification. We rate the statement False.

pomt-07938	"Of the top five cities for staged automobile accidents, three are in Florida. … We rank No. 1 in the country in staged auto accidents."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/jan/27/jeff-atwater/Florida-tops-staged-auto-accidents-Jeff-Atwater/	At the AP Legislative Planning Session on Jan. 19, 2011, Florida’s chief financial officer lobbed a claim about auto insurance shenanigans. "Of the top five cities for staged automobile accidents, three are in Florida. … We rank No. 1 in the country in staged auto accidents," Jeff Atwater said. We have long known that Florida is special, the reluctant recipient of certain superlatives. These two claims seemed almost too good to be true, but were they? We decided to delve in. Atwater made the remarks less than a week after the topic of fabricating car crashes for cash grabbed several headlines, including a front-page story in the Jan. 16 edition of the Miami Herald. A story earlier in the week chronicled the arrest of five people in Miami-Dade and a sixth in Naples. They were charged with faking car accidents after police say they hired people to stage wrecks or file false claims with insurance companies using drivers’ personal injury protection insurance policies. All told, the scammers billed insurance companies up to $170,000 for medical treatment that was never performed, according to the Florida Division of Insurance Fraud. The issue of fraud related to personal injury protection, or PIP, insurance has been of interest to Atwater. His office issued a press release reporting that PIP-related fraud costs the average Florida family as much as $400 a year. Four Florida cities are among the top 10 in PIP fraud – Hialeah, Tampa, Orlando and, yes, Miami. The Herald reported that more than 400 people were charged in the past two years with PIP fraud. And so, Atwater vowed to keep a spotlight on PIP fraud. "The thieves committing these scams need to know that it’s my plan to put them behind bars," said Atwater, a Republican from North Palm Beach. It was only a few days later that Atwater talked about the fraud cases in Florida at the AP meeting. According to spokeswoman Alexis Lambert, his statements were based on a May 10, 2010, report from the National Insurance Crime Bureau, an Illinois not-for-profit that teams up with various insurers and law enforcement agencies in an effort to prosecute insurance criminals. The study showed that reports of "staged accident questionable claims" spiked 46 percent from 2007 through 2009. The top five states that generated the most "staged accident QCs," or questionable claims, were: (1) Florida, 3,006; (2) New York, 1,680; (3) California, 1,619; (4) Texas, 792; and (5) Illinois, 433. The five cities that saw the "most staged accident QCs" were: (1) New York, 1,304; (2) Tampa, 562; (3) Miami, 511 (4) Orlando, 422; and (5) Houston, 376. These revelations don’t come as a surprise to observers. "I think it’s a generality that Florida ranks well up there," said James Quiggle, a spokesman for the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud, a Washington, D.C., anti-fraud watchdog. "I don’t think anyone who sees the national picture will dispute that." According to a 2007-2008 report from the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud, Florida led the nation in 2005 in the recovery of insurance fraud-related losses through court-ordered restitution. These court findings suggest Florida has ranked high across the board. Despite his intention to put a spotlight on auto insurance fraud, Atwater fails to note that the numbers are for "questionable claims." These, according to National Insurance Crime Bureau spokesman Frank Scafidi, are not the same as actual staged accidents. An analogy might be the difference between a charge and a conviction. The terms may often be used interchangeably, but law enforcement personnel and attorneys certainly know the difference. "We stress to people to keep in mind that these are initial referrals and not definitive acts of fraud, although most of these will certainly be fraud," Scafidi wrote in an e-mail message. Scafidi elaborated. In 2009, NICB reports that there were 85,201 questionable claims submitted and just 4,802 of that number were related to staged accidents. In an average year, he notes, more than 48 million claims are filed by the Insurance Services Office, a company that maintains claims data. That said, only 0.17 percent of the claims were deemed suspicious or questionable, and only about one in 20 of those involved questions of staged accidents. The sample is not enough to draw conclusions on, Scafidi added, but, "It is a useful tool for analysis and for us to see where the potential fraud hot spots are." Atwater is mostly correct about the high numbers of auto fraud cases coming from Florida, but he neglects to mention that the numbers he referred to are "questionable claims," not yet confirmed as actual staged accidents. It’s an important detail. For omitting that clarification, we rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Jeff Atwater	None	None	None	2011-01-27T11:48:40	2011-01-19	['None']
pomt-00872	A "majority of our students are trapped in" underperforming schools.	false	/texas/statements/2015/mar/12/george-p-bush/george-p-bush-says-majority-our-students-trapped-u/	George P. Bush, the first-year Texas land commissioner, maintains that most students are stuck in bad schools. Bush, addressing a "school choice" rally outside the Texas Capitol Jan. 30, 2015, said: "I believe that most teachers are doing the very best in very difficult situations when a majority of our students are trapped in schools that are underperforming. Some schools don’t work and refuse to change — and that’s why we need school choice and that’s why we need it now." The Rev. Charles Johnson, executive director of Pastors for Texas Children, which describes itself as an independent ministry and outreach group supporting quality public education opportunities for Texas children, asked us to check Bush’s statement, which Johnson said he heard about from someone who watched the rally. We were curious too. Asked where Bush’s data came from, Brittany Eck, a General Land Office spokeswoman, pointed out a comment by the state’s chief education official in October 2013, when Texas received a waiver from the federal Adequate Yearly Progress requirement that more than 90 percent of students in each school and district pass the state’s standardized tests in reading and math, in accord with the No Child Left Behind Act that passed into law when George W. Bush was president. At the time Texas got its waiver, Eck said by email, the state’s education commissioner, Michael Williams, said 95 percent of the state’s school districts would not have met the federal law’s expectations, according to an October 2013 news story in the Dallas Morning News. Eck noted the same judgment was aired by a non-governmental group, the Texas Classroom Teachers Association. Meantime, Eck wrote, only 28 percent to 41 percent of Texas fourth- and eighth-graders chosen to take the National Assessment of Educational Progress, sometimes called the nation’s report card, met "proficiency" levels in math or reading in 2013. Some perspective: According to the 2013 results, 62 percent to 84 percent of the Texas students scored well enough to meet basic expectations or better. State accountability ratings Next, we asked the Texas Education Agency what it considers the best measurement of schools in Texas. Spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe said by email the state’s own accountability system is the only rating system in place. And according to the latest state summary of the ratings, released in December 2014, 949 of the state’s 1,025 school districts, 93 percent, "met standard" while 76 districts were rated "improvement required." The summary said 6,723, or 86 percent, of the state’s individual schools "met standard" with 142 meeting an alternate standard — leaving 636 campuses rated "improvement required," meaning the campus missed the state’s standard on one or more performance indicators, according to the TEA. Those indicators include student results on the State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readiness (STAAR) and graduation and annual dropout rates, according to the TEA’s Accountability Manual. For 2014, the summary said, some 484 campuses weren’t rated and one school had "data integrity issues." (We did not consider charter schools to carve out these counts; there aren’t a lot of them.) Overall in the year, Ratcliffe said, 372,287 of the state’s 5,151,925 public-school students, 7 percent, were enrolled in schools that received the "improvement required" rating. Ratcliffe did not dispute that Williams had said 95 percent of the state’s districts would not have cleared the AYP hurdles. The waived expectation under the federal law was that more than 90 percent of students in each school and district pass the state’s standardized tests in reading and math. "We do fall short of perfection," Ratcliffe said. Texas Classroom Teachers Association Given that Eck singled out the classroom teachers association, we asked that group, which advocates for teachers, to assess Bush’s statement. By email, Holly Eaton focused on doubts about the usefulness of the AYP standards, which she said have long been regarded as not attainable at the law’s stipulated pace, explaining why many states (more than 40, the News story said) got waivers, she said. "Accordingly, the projection that 95% of Texas schools would have failed to meet AYP in 2014 shows that Texas was in the same predicament as every other state in the country due to a poorly conceived and widely discredited federal standard," Eaton said. By phone, she elaborated: "We don’t think the federal AYP ratings are of any significance." Broadly, Eaton said, the association disagrees with Bush’s characterization. Other perspectives We also reached out to other close observers of Texas schools. Lori Taylor, a Texas A&M University associate professor in the Bush School of Government and Public Service, commented by email: "I think the term ‘underperforming’ is really squishy. If one has exceedingly high standards for education, then every school is always underperforming." Taylor pointed out the state’s 2014 accountability ratings — and called AYP an "odd standard of performance" because of the law’s everyone-must-pass requirement for a school to be considered acceptable. "Most researchers are highly critical of AYP as a measure of performance, so schools that are performing badly by this measure are not necessarily underperforming as most folks understand the term," Taylor wrote. Also by email, Torey Tipton of Children at Risk, which analyzes test results and other indicators in its own way, said many Texas children are in failing schools. In spring 2014, she said, 2,275, or 30 percent, of more than 7,000 schools ranked by the group landed Children at Risk grades of D, needing "significant improvement," or F, which the group defines as "highly concerning." Our ruling Bush said the "majority of our students are trapped in" underperforming schools. Bush relied on another official’s speculation about how well schools might meet disputed federal standards that don’t apply to Texas this year anyway.

pomt-05581	Says she "created the first felony deferred prosecution program for nonviolent first-offenders" in Texas.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/apr/03/rosemary-lehmberg/travis-da-rosemary-lehmberg-says-she-created-state/	In an online video, Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who seeks re-election this year, says she has instituted reforms since she took office in 2009. "My office is the most progressive DA’s office in the state," she says. "I’ve created the first felony deferred prosecution program for nonviolent first-offenders, and it gives them a chance to stay out of the system with a clean record." Vince Leibowitz, a campaign consultant for Charlie Baird, who is challenging Lehmberg in the May Democratic primary, questioned Lehmberg’s statement that her program was the first of its kind in the state and asked us to fact-check it. The Travis County program, which Lehmberg announced in May 2010, gives people who have committed certain felony offenses an opportunity to avoid being prosecuted for a crime by agreeing to meet certain conditions for a period of time. A March 23, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news article on the program points out that since the 1990s, people with drug addictions and no previous convictions for violent offenses could escape certain felony charges by completing the county’s drug court program, which requires a year of intensive treatment, drug testing and court appearances aimed at ending addictions. Lehmberg told us in a telephone interview that she started the felony deferred prosecution program to provide the same second-chance opportunity for nonviolent, first-time felony offenders who are not addicts. "Sort of a parallel track," she said. The program is for people with no prior record who made a mistake and want to make it right, she said. If they complete the program, the charges are dismissed. Applicants must be facing third-degree or state jail felony charges such as theft, forgery, credit card abuse, tampering with a governmental record, and evading arrest, according to the program’s web page. Through their attorneys, clients apply using a form posted online that asks for basic information, including the defendant’s school and work history, an account of the crime and information about previous contact with the criminal justice system. The application is screened by lawyers in Lehmberg’s office, who typically make the decision on whether to accept an applicant. Offenders accepted into the program sign a form pleading guilty and enter into a written agreement with the office laying out the terms they must meet for a set time, up to two years, including not being re-arrested. Other possible conditions of participation are community service, counseling and paying restitution. While people are in the program, their cases are tracked by state District Judge Mike Lynch. The deferred prosecution program, also called a pretrial diversion program, started in September 2010. The Statesman article said that through March 12, 2012, 131 people had been accepted, with 26 having completed the program and eight having been discharged without finishing. So, is the program the first of its kind in the state? During our research, several prosecutors and experts told us that generally, prosecutors don’t have to develop a formal program like Lehmberg’s to practice "deferred prosecution." That’s because local prosecutors have long been free to decide not to proceed with a case. A common example: Dismissing the charges against a young adult in exchange for his or her joining the military. Such case-by-case arrangements are a form of deferred prosecution, Williamson County District Attorney John Bradley told us in a telephone interview. But typically, when someone is talking about a deferred prosecution program, he said, there are more formalized elements that have been put in place such as a list of qualifications and a screening process. Bradley, who has been a prosecutor since 1989, said he didn’t know whether Travis County was the first in the state to offer such a program for certain felony offenders. Most Texas deferred prosecution programs focus on misdemeanors, he said. "It is unusual and rare at the felony level to have a deferred prosecution program," he said. Unlike counties such as Dallas and Bexar where the district attorney prosecutes both felonies and misdemeanors, Travis has a separate elected official, the county attorney, whose office handles misdemeanor cases. And that office had a diversion program long before Lehmberg launched her version, according to Lehmberg and the Statesman article. Lehmberg told us that it’s "pretty common" for prosecutors at both the felony and misdemeanor level to offer deferred prosecutions on a case-by-case basis. Narrowing the claim she aired in the video, Lehmberg said she is not aware of any other formalized non-drug-court deferred prosecution program for felony offenders that has an "application and acceptance process" like Travis County’s. She told us that before making her campaign video, she checked with some other Texas prosecutors and Robert Kepple, executive director of the Texas District and County Attorneys Association, to determine whether another program like hers had been started. She found none. Kepple told us that the association did not know of any other program like Travis’ but that he had not researched the question specifically. Yet, we later learned of two programs that while not identical to the one in Travis County, appear to have similar goals and share some of its processes. One, in the East Texas county of Nacogdoches, started the same year as Travis County’s, in 2010. The other, in the South Texas county of Cameron, began about five years earlier. We were alerted to the Nacogdoches program by an email sent from Austin lawyer Oscar Buitron in response to the Statesman article. Like Travis County, Nacogdoches has a district attorney who handles felony cases and a county attorney in charge of misdemeanor cases. We were unable to reach District Attorney Nicole LoStracco but found a May 1, 2010, news article reporting that she was starting a pretrial diversion program. We also talked with Nacogdoches defense attorney John Heath Jr. who said he has had many clients in LoStracco’s program. The 2010 article, in the Nacogdoches Daily Sentinel, quoted LoStracco as saying that under the program, first-time felony offenders who meet certain qualifications could avoid a permanent red flag on their record. She said her program would be for people who realize that they made a mistake, are repentant, and are willing to learn from the mistake and move on. The article said LoStracco’s office had put in place "guidelines" for the program, including that first-time felony offenders who aren’t likely to commit another offense will be considered. The article also said that defense lawyers must approach the district attorney’s office to apply for the program and that candidates would be required to fill out an application. Participants would also have to write a confession and pay any owed restitution up front, according to the article. Ultimately, LoStracco told the Daily Sentinel, she will decide who qualifies for the program and is "the only one in the DA’s office that can authorize someone to be put on the program." The article said those in the Nacogdoches pretrial diversion program would be monitored by the local probation department. Conditions of the program could include community service, alcohol or drug testing, or counseling, the article said. On June 1, 2011, the Daily Sentinel wrote a news article reporting that in the year since the program’s start, 37 felony offenders had been placed into the program, with only two having been removed for failing to meet the conditions. Heath Jr., the defense attorney, told us that upon completion of the program, participants have the charges against them dismissed. We learned about the Cameron County program from a 2005 news article on the Brownsville Herald’s website that was sent to us by Tobin Lefler, director of Cameron County’s adult probation department. Armando Villalobos, the county’s top prosecutor, handles both felonies and misdemeanors. That means the county’s pretrial diversion program, which Villalobos began in 2005, is open to both misdemeanor and felony offenders. The Dec. 27, 2005, article says that Villalobos, of late a U.S. House candidate, launched the program to give eligible defendants a chance to avoid criminal records that could ruin their careers. In a telephone interview, Villalobos told us that "a lot of felonies" go through his program. A spokesman for his office said it did not have statistics on how many there have been. After examining the Travis County program’s web page, Villalobos said his program was similar. "We don’t have anything as formal as a written application," he said. "We have criteria, and we have forms they fill out if they are going to participate in the program." First-time offenders who committed nonviolent crimes and did not resist law enforcement are eligible, according to documents Villalobos’ office shared with us. Villalobos told us that defense attorneys usually send a letter requesting that their clients be considered for the program. Prosecutors then review the request. Participants must meet conditions to stay in the program and agree to confess to their crime. As in Nacogdoches County, participants in Cameron County’s program are supervised by the local probation department. They also must pay a $500 fee to Villalobos’ office. People who complete the program have the charges against them dismissed, Villalobos said. Lehmberg, presented with our research, said she thought the Nacogdoches program was more similar to hers than the one in Cameron County, which also includes misdemeanors. She said there are some significant differences between the Travis County program and the others, highlighting the involvement of the local probation department in Cameron and Nacogdoches counties. She said the Travis program is geared toward people who don’t need that level of supervision. However, Lehmberg acknowledged that the programs have the same outcomes for successful participants: dismissal of charges upon completion. "As far as being the first," Lehmberg said, "the Nacogdoches program appears similar to mine. If she went first, so be it. I just didn’t know" that. Our ruling Lehmberg said the program she started in 2010 was the state’s first felony deferred prosecution program for nonviolent first-offenders. We found two similar, though not identical, programs in other counties. One was implemented the same year as Travis’, the other five years earlier. Since neither program shares all of the elements of Travis County’s, her claim retains an element of truth. But Travis County was not first. We rate Lehmberg’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-06394	"We are the poster child for compliance, and whenever we discover possible infractions we resolve and report it to the NCAA no matter how minor the violations."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/oct/31/e-gordon-gee/ohio-state-university-president-e-gordon-gee-says-/	Wearing a bow tie instead of shoulder pads, Ohio State University President E. Gordon Gee was nonetheless playing defense for the scarlet and gray on Oct 4. A day earlier, OSU Athletics Director Gene Smith sat three football players against Nebraska for accepting too much money for too little work at summer jobs. It was the latest NCAA infraction in a string for Ohio State dating back to December 2010 that had now encompassed summer jobs, cash handed out a charity event and the infamous tattoos-for-trinkets scandal. In all, 12 scholarship football players had been punished for infractions, former head coach Jim Tressel had been fired and a long-time program booster had been exiled. After his annual talk to faculty members, Gee told the Columbus Dispatch that the school’s athletics compliance office — the folks in charge of discovering, reporting and preventing NCAA violations — was a model for other schools to follow. "We are the poster child for compliance, and whenever we discover possible infractions we resolve and report it to the NCAA no matter how minor the violations," Gee said. "That’s what we have done here." PolitiFact Ohio normally sticks to checking the statements of Ohio’s leading political figures, but it’s not much of a stretch to view Gee as a political figure of sorts. (Gov. John Kasich has referred to him as Ohio’s greatest politician.) So we decided to buckle up our helmet and dig into whether Ohio State’s compliance office really is the "poster child" for universities across the country. First, we reached out to OSU spokesman Jim Lynch to see what he could provide to back up the notion that OSU really has the finest athletics compliance department in the nation. Lynch pointed out that the NCAA had not found major violations in any of the cases and has told OSU officials it does not see a lack of institutional control. (That’s NCAA-speak for a systematic problem.) Lynch referred PolitiFact to OSU’s official responses to the charges, which stress that Ohio State’s compliance office has at all times faithfully reported violations once they were discovered. Lynch further suggested that we speak with Chuck Smrt, a former NCAA enforcement staff official whom Ohio State has hired as part of a consulting team to help with its NCAA troubles. Although Smrt is being paid by Ohio State and far from an unbiased source, we decided to hear him out as a well-regarded national expert in the field. Smrt, a principal with the Compliance Group, said he thinks OSU’s compliance program is one of the tops in the country. "I don’t think I could ever say that any one school is the best, but I think OSU is in the top five in the country," Smrt said. Smrt said he hasn’t looked at all aspects of OSU’s athletic compliance, but the portions he’s reviewed left him with the impression that OSU has a top-notch compliance department. Smrt also said there were areas he had found where Ohio State could improve its compliance department but declined to say what they were. Other experts in athletics compliance were less glowing, but did give OSU’s office good marks. Rick Allen, a former compliance officer for two decades with Illinois and Oklahoma State who sometimes consults on compliance issues with universities, said Ohio State’s department does have a good reputation. "I’ve long had respect for their compliance office, but whether I’d go so far as to call it a model compliance department, I’d hesitate to do that because I think there are a lot of good ones across the country," Allen said. Allen said that a high number of violations may show a lack of rules education. "If you’re a school that is reporting a lot of violations, you may have good monitoring procedures, but maybe you need to beef up your rules education a little bit," he said. In fact, OSU Athletics Director Smith blamed inadequate rules education for contributing to the suspensions of six players for selling awards for discounts on tattoos. "We were not as explicit with our student-athlete education as we should have been in the 2007-08 and 2008-09 academic years regarding the sale of apparel, awards and gifts issued by the athletics department," Smith is quoted as saying in a Dec. 23, 2010 release from the NCAA. Dave Ridpath, an Ohio University professor who worked in the athletics compliance offices for Marshall University and Weber State, said Gee’s comment is an overstatement made for public relations reasons. "I’m not going to say he’s completely off his rocker, but it’s a statement he should probably never make," said Ridpath. Ridpath said Ohio State has a "strong" compliance department, but said it’s "an impossible situation" for schools with highly profitable football teams to have a model compliance department. "Any school that is at a major level, I don’t think any of them could say they have a model compliance department," Ridpath said. "At schools operating on an Ohio State or SEC level, the most important thing at those schools is winning games, player-eligibility and revenue generation, so compliance is never something pushed to the forefront." Beyond the opinions of experts, we reviewed internal audits of the compliance department dating back to 2006 and done in accordance with NCAA rules. Those records show that each year, OSU’s internal auditors found multiple practices in the compliance department that needed improvement. In fact, some of the weaknesses identified by internal auditors were in the same areas where NCAA infractions were later committed by OSU players. For example, a November 2010 audit found that OSU wasn’t keeping an inventory of awards given to players. The selling of awards by players was the central issue in the tattoos-for-trinkets scandal. While there is no evidence that the compliance department knew of any violations by the players, the same cannot be said for Ohio State’s most famous employee: Tressel. In March 2011, Ohio State discovered three email strings from a local attorney to Tressel from April and June 2010 informing the coach about players selling awards for discounts on tattoos from a tattoo parlor owner being investigated on federal drug charges. Although he knew that would have made the players ineligible, Tressel never reported what he had learned in the emails to OSU officials. Ohio State has said that is why they fired the popular coach. Meanwhile, a 2007 audit found that the compliance department wasn’t keeping earning statements of any athletes from part-time jobs and that only 40 percent of the time were employers filling out monitoring paperwork on what jobs athletes were doing. In early October, the overpayment of athletes for part-time jobs was what caused three players to miss the Nebraska game. Two of the audits also cite continuing problems with athletes not properly registering the cars they were driving with the compliance office — first in 2006 and again in 2010. Amid the ongoing issues, the university is considering taking compliance away from the athletics department and creating a university-wide compliance department to better improve compliance, according to news reports. "We believe we have very sound processes and protocols. Many of them have been validated by third parties as being at or near the best in class," OSU Trustee Robert Schottenstein told The Lantern, Ohio State’s student newspaper, for a story. "Still, as I said, we believe we can get better." So what’s our score here? We haven’t found any experts — including one employed by OSU as a consultant — who describe the university as a poster child for compliance. The experts we interviewed think the compliance department is fairly strong, but not a model for other schools to follow. Ohio State itself has acknowledged it didn’t properly educate football players several years ago on whether they could sell the awards they were given. And internal audits of athletic compliance departments in recent years show weaknesses cropping up each year, including several areas that have blown up into public infractions for football players during the past year. Additionally, OSU trustees are considering moving the compliance department outside of athletics to improve the program. In fairness, Gee’s statement was focused on reporting and resolving violations, not necessarily preventing them, even though that’s also the compliance department’s job. And there is no evidence that the compliance office has failed to properly report infractions to the NCAA or cover up anything that has come to light. The NCAA has said it doesn’t see anything that points to a systematic problem in athletics in the recent infractions. However, the actions of Coach Tressel, a prominent figure with major responsibility in the athletics department, constitute a critical failure in reporting violations -- a failure that cost him his job. So OSU isn’t exactly "the poster child for compliance," but we’ll give Gee some points for accuracy in describing the university’s commitment to reporting violations. We’ll have to throw a flag for hyperbole, though, and rate the statement Half True.	None	E. Gordon Gee	None	None	None	2011-10-31T06:00:00	2011-10-04	['None']
pomt-09173	"We have SAT scores lower than that of Alabama."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/jun/04/john-oxendine/sat-scores/	In a video on his campaign Web site, gubernatorial candidate John Oxendine makes the case that Georgia's education system has serious problems. His evidence: Our students are doing worse than those in ... Alabama. This is what he said: "As a parent of four children, three of them in school, I’m very concerned about our education system. We have SAT scores lower than that of Alabama, yet a dropout rate that’s higher. We need to make some serious changes in how we address education.” Georgia? Even worse than Alabama? Ouch. But is it true? For this item, we'll examine whether he is correct about Alabama beating Georgia in SAT scores. A later item will deal with his claim on dropout rates. Oxendine's campaign pointed us to the National Center for Education Statistics, which collects and publishes data for the U.S. Department of Education. Sure enough, Alabama's mean SAT scores for 2009 are higher than Georgia's in all categories: critical reading, mathematics and writing. And the gap is large. Alabama's writing score is 549, 70 points above Georgia's. Its mathematics score beats Georgia's by 61; critical reading by 67. But when we took a closer look at the numbers, we found that Oxendine's interpretation of Georgia's SAT scores is not as clear-cut as it seems. Only a small percentage of Alabama's students take the SAT compared with a much larger percentage in Georgia. For that reason and others, the College Board, the group that administers the SAT, strongly cautions against doing state comparisons. "Not all students in a high school, school district or state take the SAT. Since the population of test-takers is self-selected, using aggregate SAT scores to compare or evaluate schools, districts, states or other educational units is not valid, and the College Board strongly discourages such uses,” the College Board said in a statement to PolitiFact Georgia. This warning and others like it are repeated on the College Board's Web pages, in its statewide reports, plus in its guidelines for interpreting scores. When fewer students take the test, as in Alabama, the numbers get skewed because the test-takers are more likely to be the top students who are applying to the most selective schools. The introduction to each one of the College Board's state profile reports puts it this way: "The most significant factor to consider in interpreting SAT scores for any group, or subgroup, of test-takers is the proportion of students taking the test. For example, if state data are being considered, it is appropriate to recognize that in some states there are lower participation rates. Typically, test-takers in these states have strong academic backgrounds and apply to the nation's most selective colleges and scholarship programs. For these states, it is expected that the SAT mean scores reported for students will be higher than the national average." In Georgia during the 2008-2009 school year, 71 percent took the SAT. In Alabama, it was 7 percent. And indeed, Alabama's scores walloped Georgia's. To get a different view of how the states compared, we decided to look at scores for the ACT, the college entrance exam that is more widely used in Alabama. According to 2009 figures, 76 percent of Alabama high school graduates took the ACTs, with an average composite score of 20.3. In Georgia, 40 percent took the test and scored an average of 20.6. So on the ACT, Georgia beat Alabama. And we got the same kids-don't-try-this-at-home warning from the ACT we got from the College Board: It's not smart to compare the scores of two states. We took these facts to the Oxendine campaign, which said our examination misses its overall point that Georgia needs to make education a higher priority. Plus, the campaign argued, people such as business owners who look at Georgia's SAT scores will see them and worry that this state doesn't have a labor pool that is strong enough for its needs. Whether Georgia needs to make education a higher priority is a matter of opinion. But we think people who hear his claim will wonder whether Georgia indeed has lower SAT scores than its neighbor. He's technically correct, but his claim ignores some important caveats. With so few students in Alabama taking the test, the results can be skewed and paint a misleading picture. Indeed, the ACT shows Georgia ahead of Alabama. So we find his claim Half True.	None	John Oxendine	None	None	None	2010-06-04T20:23:04	2010-06-03	['Alabama']
pomt-13903	Says "Paul Ryan shut off the C-SPAN cameras when the Democrats started their sit-in."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2016/jun/27/stephen-colbert/stephen-colbert-wrong-paul-ryan-killed-house-camer/	It was June 22, 2016. House Democrats had staged a sit-in on the floor of the House to try to force a vote on gun-control legislation. The House, in response, went into recess and the cameras in the House chamber were shut off. It may not sound like the makings of a viral late-night joke, but stay tuned. Undaunted, Democrats started transmitting video and images of the sit-in via social media tools such as Periscope, a live video streaming app. The sit-in, which House Speaker Paul Ryan subsequently blasted as a publicity stunt, lasted 26 hours. The Late Show with Stephen Colbert carried a 25-second comedy bit about the event, which began with a pan up the facade of the Ed Sullivan Theater, where the show is taped, followed by a quick cut to Colbert, holding a dog and sitting on a couch with supervising producer and writer Paul Dinello. Both were watching the feed from the House floor on a wall-mounted TV. "Why am I watching Congress on Periscope?" Colbert asks. "That's because Paul Ryan shut off the C-SPAN cameras when the Democrats started their sit-in," Dinello responds. "Really?" Colbert responds. "Wow, what a petty son of a —" Suddenly the picture cuts to a cartoon of Ryan holding two ends of an unplugged power cord and the sign, "Sorry! Technical Difficulties." The crowd inside the Ed Sullivan Theater cackled. But they didn’t have the full story. Did Ryan really shut off the C-SPAN cameras in the House chamber? Facebook posts said yes. Elizabeth Warren tweeted, "@SpeakerRyan shut off the camera so you can't watch. Shameful." The Daily Show said so as well. The real answer is no. Congress' rules for operating the cameras — which Congress controls — call for video transmission to end as soon as the gavel goes down for recess or adjournment. What happened when the protest started Roll Call provided a good timeline of the protest and the reaction of Republicans. The House was in session and cameras were rolling the morning of June 22. Lawmakers were in something called "Morning Hour," which basically allows members to speak to any issue. At about 11:25 a.m., Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., took to the House floor with a group of Democrats and demanded lawmakers vote on gun legislation. Rep. John Larson, D-Conn., spoke next with a similar message. At that point, Larson yielded the floor to Lewis, who said, "Now is the time to find a way to dramatize it, to make it real." Lewis and a number of Democrats then sat down in the House well. At the time, Ryan wasn't at the speaker's rostrum. The presiding officer was Rep. Daniel Webster, R-Fla. Webster, after conferring with House staff, declared a recess. When Webster declared the recess, the cameras in the House went dead. About a half-hour later, around noon, Republicans tried to gavel the House back into session and the cameras came back on. Again, Ryan was not the presiding officer. This time it was Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas. Democrats remained in the well of the House. Poe declared that the House "is currently not in a state of order" and called another recess. The cameras went black again. Fast-forward to shortly after 10 p.m. The House came back into session and the cameras turned on again. This time, Ryan asked Democrats to end the protest. They didn't, and the protest continued as Republicans struggled off and on to conduct some House business into the early morning hours. At 3:13 a.m., they adjourned until Friday, and the cameras were turned off. The key point The main takeaway in all of this is what triggered the camera going on and off. The camera was off because the House was not in session, not because of an order from Ryan. That's been a House standard going back years. This isn't the first time this has happened. During a sit-in eight years ago, cameras were cut for the Republicans when Democrats controlled the House. Minority Leader John Boehner wanted a vote on offshore oil drilling, a motion to adjourn was passed, and the C-SPAN cameras were turned off. The Republicans kept talking anyway. In that case, the lights and the microphones were turned off for a while as well. Yet the Republicans kept talking. As Politico reported, "Democratic aides were furious at the GOP stunt." That protest lasted five hours. But back then, social media and video streaming services weren’t in the palms of every lawmaker’s hand. When the Democrats staged the latest protest, several members were broadcasting on Facebook and Periscope. C-SPAN picked up both feeds and continued to show the events, using the same style and logos they use when they're tapping into the House cameras. We note that, in the sketch, Colbert isn't the person saying, "Paul Ryan shut off the C-SPAN cameras when the Democrats started their sit-in." But just as we make candidates responsible for all the statements in their ads, we have no doubt Colbert approved this message. A CBS spokeswoman, who identified Dinello for us, declined comment on the content of the sketch. Our ruling The Late Show with Stephen Colbert asserted that Ryan "shut off the C-SPAN cameras when the Democrats started their sit-in." Ryan didn't order the cameras shut off in response to the protest. They were turned off because House Republicans declared the House session in recess. That's a standard policy of Congress, even if it was Republicans making the decision. Colbert's bit was funny, but on its factual basis we rate the statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/92344eb8-90bb-4f8f-8538-82fe220e5176	None	Stephen Colbert	None	None	None	2016-06-27T18:00:31	2016-06-23	['Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'C-SPAN', 'Paul_Ryan']
pomt-07295	"The Democrats have already voted to ban our conventional light bulbs ... in favor of dangerous fluorescent light bulbs."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/20/ameripac/conservative-pac-claims-democrats-banned-incandesc/	A fundraising letter making the rounds from a conservative political action committee draws a political line in the sand over light bulbs. "The Democrats have already voted to BAN our conventional lights bulbs (that you and I use even today!) in favor of DANGEROUS fluorescent light bulbs," writes Alan Gottlieb, chairman of AmeriPAC, a political action committee that largely supports conservative Republican candidates. The letter then invites people to read a letter from the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise Action Fund. "By outlawing incandescent lights in favor of compact fluorescent lighting, the environmentalists said the country would reduce energy consumption by $18 billion a year, or save consumers between $80 to $180 on their electric bills per year," the letter states. "The plus for the globalists? They said it would reduce global warming because one of the causes of global warming is...you guessed it...the old fashioned Tom Edison light bulb." The letter seeks contributions and support for S.B. 395, the Better Use of Light Bulbs (BULB) Act, sponsored by Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., which seeks to repeal the light bulb efficiency standards included in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. "Help put an end to governmental interference in our lives! Help put an end to Mr. Obama interfering with free enterprise!" the letter urges, referring to President Barack Obama. We are checking several claims from these light bulb letters, and in this one, we will tackle the central claim that, "Democrats have already voted to ban our conventional lights bulbs (that you and I use even today!) in favor of dangerous fluorescent light bulbs." First off, it's not accurate to pin the law entirely to Democrats. It's true that more Democrats than Republicans voted for the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. But it got a measure of bipartisan support. It passed the House with a 264-163 vote (with 36 Republicans voting in favor). And in the Senate, the vote was 65-27 (with 20 votes in favor from Republicans). And it was signed by Republican President George W. Bush. We also explore the issue of whether fluorescent bulbs release "dangerous" amounts of mercury into the environment in a separate fact-check. But the bigger issue here is the claim that the bill bans incandescent light bulbs. Sec. 321 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 spells out the new standards, essentially requiring that light bulbs be 25 percent more efficient than they are now. Specifically, a 100 watt light bulb is to be replaced with a bulb using no more than 72 watts of electricity while still providing comparable light output. The 75-watt, 60-watt and 40-watt bulbs must be replaced by bulbs using no more than 53, 43 and 29 watts respectively. The law phased in the new requirements: first the replacements for the 100-watt bulbs by Jan. 1, 2012; followed by the lower watt bulbs in ensuing years. The curlicue compact fluorescent bulbs and LED light bulbs easily meet the new efficiency standards. But we couldn't find any language in the law that specifically bans incandescent bulbs. So we asked Ron Arnold of the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise Action Fund to back up the claim that the law "outlaws" incandescent light bulbs. Arnold said the bill is filled with vague and confusing language and that there is a de facto ban because the standards are so stringent that no manufacturers will be able to build incandescent bulbs that meet them. "We believe 'ban' is an accurate term because there is no such thing as what they require," Arnold said. "If it's available, where can I buy it?" he asked. "Why doesn't Home Depot carry them?" Actually, they do, said Randy Moorhead, VP of government affairs at Philips Electronics, one of the three major manufacturers of light bulbs in the U.S. Philips' new EcoVantage bulb, a halogen incandescent light bulb that runs on 72 watts but throws off as much light as a standard 100 watt bulb (and lasts just as long), shipped out to Home Depot in April, he said. Philips also offers a premium bulb that costs more, but lasts three times longer. Both bulbs are more expensive than the current 100 watt incandescent bulbs, but they more than pay for themselves in savings on electricity to power them (more on that in another fact-check). The two other big players in the industry, Osram Sylvania and GE, have also developed new halogen incandescent bulbs that meet the new efficiency standards. But for those, you'll have to head to Lowe's. Moorhead said industry representatives were closely involved in the legislative process to develop the new efficiency standards and would never have supported a ban of incandescent bulbs. The companies, as well as the legislators who drafted the bill, were keenly aware that the new standards could be met through the development of halogen incandescent light bulbs, he said. "You don't have to buy fluorescent bulbs," said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. Jen Stutsman, a spokeswoman for the Department of Energy, said the claims about a ban on incandescent light bulbs are simply wrong. "It doesn't ban a specific type of light bulb," she said. This one is a clear call for us. It's true that the current versions of incandescent light bulbs will be phased out of existence. Compact fluorescent and LED bulbs offer more efficient alternatives, but if incandescent light is your thing, the major light bulb makers have you covered. They have developed and shipped halogen incandescent bulbs that meet the new efficiency standards, so there is no basis in fact to claim they have been banned in favor of fluorescent bulbs. We rule this claim Pants on Fire.	None	AmeriPAC	None	None	None	2011-05-20T14:35:55	2011-05-16	['Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-11530	"In the rest of the world, there have been 18 school shootings in the last twenty years. In the U.S., there have been 18 school shootings since January 1."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/feb/15/jeff-greenfield/mostly-false-18-us-school-shootings-so-far-2018-an/	Amid the early news reports about a Florida school shooting that left 17 dead on Feb. 14, 2018, longtime network TV journalist and author Jeff Greenfield declared in a tweet: In the rest of the world, there have been 18 school shootings in the last twenty years. In the U.S., there have been 18 school shootings since January 1. It’s a provocative claim that drew more the 130,000 likes on Twitter. Greenfield, a University of Wisconsin-Madison graduate, may be on the right track generally in contrasting how much gun violence there is in America compared to the rest of the world. But as for his specific claim, he leaves a misleading impression with the U.S. part and lacks evidence for the part about the rest of the world. U.S. school shootings On the U.S. part of his claim, Greenfield told us his 18 school shootings in 2018 comes from the Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund, as reported by ABC News. We found that in the immediate aftermath of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Politico, TIME, CNBC and other national media also reported on Everytown’s 18 figure. In addition, the New York Daily News claimed 18 school shootings, listing the same incidents as Everytown, and HuffPost reported 18, too. But there are some major caveats to that figure. Indeed, when we asked Greenfield for information to back up his claim, he noted to us in his email that the Everytown group’s count "conflates very different incidents, from the harmless to the deadly." As PolitiFact National has reported, Everytown, an advocacy group co-founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg that seeks to prevent gun violence, uses a broad definition of school shooting -- that is, any time a firearm discharges a live round inside a school building, or on a school campus or grounds. Its database includes incidents when no one was injured; attempted or completed suicide, with no intent to injure others; and cases when a gun was fired unintentionally, resulting in injury or death. The list also includes incidents on college campuses. As we’ll see, Everytown counts shooting incidents that are dramatically different than what happened in Florida: 2018 U.S. school shootings as counted by Everytown Date Place Details Jan. 3 East Olive Elementary, St. Johns, Mich. Man committed suicide in parking lot. No other injuries. (We found the building was not being used as a school, as East Olive had been shut down more than six months earlier.) Jan. 4 New Start High, Seattle Unidentified shooter fired shots into building. No injuries. Jan. 10 Grayson College, Denison, Texas Student unintentionally fired a bullet from gun legally possessed by an instructor that struck a wall. No injuries. Jan. 10 Coronado Elementary, Sierra Vista, Ariz. Student committed suicide in bathroom. No other injuries. Jan. 10 California State University, San Bernardino Gunshots, most likely fired from off campus, hit a campus building window. No injuries. Jan. 15 Wiley College, Marshall, Texas Shots fired from car in parking lot, with one shot hitting window of residence hall. No injuries. Jan. 20 Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, N.C. One student wounds another student during argument at sorority party. Jan. 22 Italy High, Italy, Texas Student opens fire in cafeteria, wounding one student before firing at another student and missing. Jan. 22 NET Charter High, Gentilly, La. Unknown person fired shots at students standing in parking lot. No injuries from gunshots. Jan. 23 Marshall County High, Benton, Ky. 2 students left dead in mass shooting by student. More than a dozen students injured. Jan. 25 Murphy High, Mobile, Ala. Student fired into the air outside school after argument in school. No injuries. Jan. 26 Dearborn High, Dearborn, Mich. Individual ejected from game for fighting was shot at in parking lot. No injuries. Jan. 31 Lincoln High, Philadelphia Man fatally wounded in fight in parking lot. Feb. 1 Salvador B. Castro Middle, Los Angeles Student unintentionally fires gun in classroom, wounds two students. Feb. 5 Oxon Hill High, Oxon Hill, Md. Student wounded in parking lot during apparent robbery. Feb. 5 Harmony Learning K-12, Maplewood, Minn. Student pressed trigger on school liaison officer’s gun. No injuries. Feb. 8 Metropolitan High, New York, N.Y. Student fired gun into floor in classroom. No injuries. Feb. 14 Stoneman Douglas High, Parkland, Fla. Ex-student allegedly commits mass shooting; 17 deaths. So, there are 18 incidents in which a gun was fired inside a school or on school property. Three -- Italy, Texas, Kentucky and Florida -- were mass shootings. But of the other shootings: Nine involved no deaths and no gunshot injuries. Two were suicides, with no other injuries (including the one at the closed school). Three were unintentional (although one caused injuries). Rest of the world As PolitiFact National has noted, mass shootings do happen in other countries. But they do not happen with the same frequency as in the United States. Two researchers -- Jaclyn Schildkraut of the State University of New York in Oswego and H. Jaymi Elsass of Texas State University -- analyzed mass shootings in 11 countries, covering the period from 2000-14. Aside from the United States, they looked at Australia, Canada, China, England, Finland, France, Germany, Mexico, Norway and Switzerland. The United States had more mass shootings -- and more people cumulatively killed or injured -- than the other 10 nations combined, according to their research. While part of this is because the United States has a much bigger population than all but China, the difference can’t be explained by skewed population numbers alone. But as for the other part of Greenfield’s claim -- that there have been only 18 school shootings in the rest of the world over the past 20 years -- Greenfield told us he couldn’t recall the source of that information, adding, "yes, I cop to insufficient research." Mark Bryant, executive director of the Gun Violence Archive (which the New York Times uses to track school shooting data), told us the 18-shootings figure could be correct in terms of how many mass shootings occur in schools outside of the United States that get widespread news coverage. But Bryant said there is no way to know -- based on the definition of school shootings that Greenfield relies on -- how many such shootings occur around the globe. About 24 hours after posting the tweet, Greenfield took it down. Our rating In the wake of a Florida school shooting that left 17 people dead, Greenfield said: "In the rest of the world, there have been 18 school shootings in the last twenty years. In the U.S., there have been 18 school shootings since January 1." By one count widely cited in the news media, there have been 18 incidents in which shots were fired inside or outside of a school or university building in the United States so far in 2018. But only three involved a mass shooting. And the count includes two suicides, three accidental shootings and nine incidents in which there were no fatalities or injuries. As for the rest of the world, Greenfield had no evidence to back up that part of his claim. And an expert relied on by the New York Times for gun violence statistics told us there is no way to know how many school shootings -- using the definition Greenfield relies on -- have occurred outside of the United States over the past 20 years. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Jeff Greenfield	None	None	None	2018-02-15T17:49:19	2018-02-14	['United_States']
pomt-02760	"The Earth is not warming."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2013/dec/13/barry-smitherman/scientific-consensus-remains-planet-warming/	Barry Smitherman sees the planet as not warming. Smitherman, a candidate for Texas attorney general, responded to Republican activist Donna Garner in a Nov. 17, 2013, email: "Donna, I have been battling this global warming hoax for 6 years now. The earth is not warming…" A day later, Garner included his comment in an email blast to recipients including reporters. That claim by Smitherman, who also chairs the Texas Railroad Commission, contradicts the latest word from the international body that regularly sifts scientific findings related to climate. An October 2013 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report intended for policymakers states: "Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen, and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased." Candidate's backup We were curious how Smitherman reached his conclusion. His campaign consultant, Allen Blakemore, emailed us web links to about a dozen articles essentially saying that the planet has not been warming as fast as predicted of late or is, in fact, cooling. A Jan. 27, 2012, Wall Street Journal opinion piece, signed by 16 scientists, said there was no need for countries to take drastic steps against greenhouse gases. A secondary theme of the piece was that planetary warming had been smaller than predicted for more than a decade. Similarly, a Sept. 8, 2013, news story in the Telegraph, a British newspaper, said: "Despite the original forecasts, major climate research centres now accept that there has been a ‘pause’ in global warming since 1997." The story quoted two U.S. professors, Judith Curry of the Georgia Institute of Technology and Anastasios Tsonis of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, as saying the planet appears headed into a cooling period. A Forbes magazine article by Peter Ferrara, published May 31, 2012, said "natural climate cycles have already turned from warming to cooling, global temperatures have already been declining for more than 10 years, and global temperatures will continue to decline for another two decades or more," a conclusion Ferrara attributed to presentations at a conference on climate change hosted by the libertarian Heartland Institute. By email, Blakemore and Jared Craighead, Smitherman’s campaign manager, urged us to view a video placed on YouTube on June 27, 2012, of a presentation by Don Easterbrook, a professor emeritus of geology at Western Washington University. In it, Easterbrook said that scant temperature changes support his 2000 statement that global warming is over, making the key question only how intense the cooling period will be. Also noted by Blakemore: An Oct. 13, 2012, commentary by David Rose in the Daily Mail, a British publication, which began: "The world stopped getting warmer almost 16 years ago, according to new data released last week. The figures, which have triggered debate among climate scientists, reveal that from the beginning of 1997 until August 2012, there was no discernible rise in aggregate global temperatures. This means that the ‘plateau’ or ‘pause’ in global warming has now lasted for about the same time as the previous period when temperatures rose, 1980 to 1996. Before that, temperatures had been stable or declining for about 40 years." Rose quoted Curry, of Georgia, as saying the data confirmed a pause in global warming. "Climate models are very complex, but they are imperfect and incomplete," Curry said. "Natural variability (the impact of factors such as long-term temperature cycles in the oceans and the output of the sun) has been shown over the past two decades to have a magnitude that dominates the greenhouse warming effect. It is becoming increasingly apparent that our attribution of warming since 1980 and future projections of climate change needs to consider natural internal variability as a factor of fundamental importance," Curry said. Still, and in contrast to Smitherman’s claim, the Daily Mail article closed by referring to global warming as "real, and some of it at least has been caused by the CO2 emitted by fossil fuels. But the evidence is beginning to suggest that it may be happening much slower than the catastrophists have claimed–a conclusion with enormous policy implications." Debate about reconsideration By email, Curry didn’t directly answer whether the globe is warming: "There has been no statistically significant increase in global average surface temperatures for the past 17 years." Per Curry’s point, Michael Tobis, an Austin software engineer whose blog, Planet 3.0, often brushes climate topics, said by email: "There are strong indications that the deep ocean is heating more than anticipated, which would account for some missing warming at the surface… But it's crucial to understand this--the world has not wandered so far from what we expected as to require a deep reconsideration of the consensus" that global warming persists. Tobis continued: "There's no doubt that CO2 is piling up in the atmosphere. There's no doubt that human activity caused it. There's no doubt that CO2 is a major factor in how energy flows through the climate system, and that changing it leads to a changed climate. There's practically no doubt that in the long run the planet will end up substantially warmer than it is. Figuring out how it gets from here to there matters a lot to human beings who live out our brief lives during the adjustment period. And there are some uncertainties there--it turns out transitions are harder to calculate than final outcomes. But nothing we see reduces our confidence in our understanding." Separately, the Texas state climatologist, John Nielsen-Gammon, pointed out by email a National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration chart indicating a steady rise in ocean heat content, meaning temperatures averaged through the depth of the ocean, since the late 1960s. Like Tobis, though, Nielsen-Gammon said temperatures near the ocean surface have risen more slowly in the past 15 years or so "than they had during the previous 35, and it is possible to find time intervals (such as the past five years) in which all weather station and satellite-based global temperature compilations show a declining trend. Overall, the global surface temperature trend is essentially flat since the dramatic and unusual warmth of the 1998 El Niño year. Nielsen-Gammon’s email continued: "Just about everyone, including some of the sources quoted in the articles you listed," meaning the articles noted by Smitherman’s consultant, "believes that the present lack of surface temperature warming is both natural and temporary. Climate model projections have generally been higher than observed temperatures, which depending on your interpretation means that natural variability has temporarily masked some of the warming or that the models have overestimated the amount of non-natural warming. The causes of the discrepancy are the subject of considerable research." Cherry-picking a time period Our own online search led us to a Sept. 10, 2013, commentary by Forbes magazine staff writer Alex Knapp taking Rose to task for focusing too closely on short-term temperature changes. On the suggestion that global warming paused in 1997, Knapp wrote: "Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, ‘All of the top ten warmest years in the record have occurred since the last major El Niño event, in 1998.’ What’s more, according to NOAA, ‘Since 1976, every year including 2012 has had an annual temperature above the long-term average.’ In fact the two warmest years on record are 2005 and 2010, and the years between 2000 and 2010 had higher average temperatures than the years between 1990 and 1999. "To show the continued rise of global average temperatures over the decades, this chart from the World Meteorological Organization helps to make it pretty clear: "These rising temperatures have serious consequences. Rising temperatures melt glaciers on land, including Greenland and Antarctica. As those melts make their way to the oceans, they cause sea levels to rise. And those rising sea levels are real and have been measured. Here’s a chart of sea level rise since the 1880s – you can see the steadily rising trend for yourself. "The bottom line is that, as I wrote last summer, ‘In the end, everything about climate science boils down to one simple fact: all else being equal, increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide in a mixture of gasses will cause the mixture to absorb more heat.’" Knapp closed: "For our planet, that means as more carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere, the warmer the planet will get. Sure, there might be some short term anomalies – one year might be cooler than its preceding year, for instance – but the long term trend remains…" Texas and U.S. climatologists Broadly, the Texas climatologists we reached said Smitherman got it wrong. "The Earth is warming," Nielsen-Gammon said. By email, Katharine Hayhoe, director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University, called Smitherman’s claim incorrect, adding: "First, climate is defined as the average over 20-30 years or more precisely because atmospheric scientists know that short-term natural cycles in the rates at which heat is exchanged between the ocean and atmosphere can lead to variations in global air temperature over shorter time scales." Hayhoe and Tobis each cautioned that cherry-picking start and stop years can lead to factually skewed conclusions about temperature trends."If you cherry-pick short periods of time, you can end up with nearly any result you want," Hayhoe said. "Only by looking at the entire dataset can you see what the truth is." Hayhoe noted, too, that a study accepted for online posting by the Quarterly Journal of the Royal Metereological Society on Nov. 12, 2013, shortly before Smitherman wrote his email, indicates that global temperatures have been underestimated since 1997 because they did not correctly reflect Arctic warming. Hayhoe further said the proper measure of warming extends past ocean or air temperatures alone. She pointed us to a chart posted on the Skeptical Science website, which focuses on touting peer-reviewed science related to climate change and debunking arguments built on incomplete information. The chart indicates that based on data published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres in September 2009, the ocean and earth have been warming for the past 50 years. Curiously, the state commission chaired by Smitherman, which regulates oil and gas exploration, has a section of its website detailing scientific concerns about greenhouse gases and global warming. A source note on that site led us to the U.S. Global Change Research Program, a federal effort launched by Congress in 1990 to coordinate and integrate global change research across 13 government agencies. We then downloaded a draft "climate assessment" report from the program, dated Jan. 11, 2013, including a letter to the American people stating: "Long-term, independent records from weather stations, satellites, ocean buoys, tide gauges, and many other data sources all confirm the fact that our nation, like the rest of the world, is warming, precipitation patterns are changing, sea level is rising, and some types of extreme weather events are increasing," the draft said. Another part of the draft, prepared by the 60-member National Climate Assessment and Development Advisory Committee, said: "Evidence for climate change abounds, from the top of the atmosphere to the depths of the oceans. This evidence has been compiled by scientists and engineers from around the world, using satellites, weather balloons, thermometers, buoys, and other observing systems. The sum total of this evidence tells an unambiguous story: the planet is warming. U.S. average temperature has increased by about 1.5°F since 1895; more than 80% of this increase has occurred since 1980. The most recent decade was the nation’s hottest on record." Previous fact checks From another vantag point, recent fact checks do not support Smitherman’s statement. PolitiFact New Jersey in July 2013 rated as True a claim that every "single month since 1985 has been warmer than the historic average" and that all "12 of the warmest years on record have come in the last 15 years." Those statistics were backed up by data released by NOAA scientists and NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. As for the warmest years on record, NOAA scientists estimate that the last 15 years have included the 14 hottest years and NASA scientists have said that same time period included the 13 hottest years. A month later, though, PolitiFact Rhode Island rated as Half True a claim that global surface temperatures have been flat for 16 years. This held up partly due to the cherry-picked and short timeframe, which swept in 1998, the El Niño year that made surface temperatures exceptionally warm. When you start near an unusually hot year, there's a good chance that subsequent years will be cooler. That fact check considered major climate databases including one from NASA and another from the Hadley Centre of the Met Office, which is the United Kingdom's National Weather Service. It also tapped a tool available at SkepticalScience.com, whose Temperature Trend Calculator page allows users to pick from among several sets of temperature data and pick various timeframes. Hadley showed a .170 degree increase over those 16 years and NASA's numbers showed a .251 rise. Neither increase exceeded what could have happened by chance. Upshot: The global temperatures that were rising so rapidly in the 1970s, ‘80s, and ‘90s appeared to have stalled. In fact, the Met Office had begun referring to the latest 16 years as "the recent pause in warming." Officials there had issued three reports to try to explain the plateau. They stressed that the last decade was still the warmest on record and asserted that temperatures will likely resume their rapid rise soon, although the agency is not offering a timetable. Said physicist Robert Brecha, of the University of Dayton: "There is increasing evidence in the peer-reviewed literature that over the past decade or so more thermal energy is going into the deep ocean, rather than into the atmosphere. This is almost certainly just a temporary, cyclical process. The key point is that additional greenhouse gases trap heat in the earth system, keeping that energy from flowing back out to space," Brecha said. "So if the atmosphere doesn't receive that heat [thereby increasing its temperature] that trapped energy is nevertheless building up." For our part, we rated as Pants on Fire a legislator’s April 2013 claim that science has not shown greenhouse gases to be a problem. To the contrary, scientists have agreed for years that such gases contribute to atmospheric changes driving climatic warming. Naomi Oreskes, then a professor of history at the University of California, San Diego, sent us a chapter of a pending book updating her 2004 look into scientific consensus about climate change. A portion of the chapter said: "Scientists predicted a long time ago that increasing greenhouse gas emissions could change the climate, and now there is overwhelming evidence that it is changing the climate." However, "to say that man-made global warming is underway is not the same as agreeing about what will happen in the future. Much of the continuing debate in the scientific community involves the likely rate of future change." "There are climate scientists who actively do research in the field but disagree with the consensus position," the chapter later says, "but their number is very, very small." We also contacted Oreskes for this article. She passed our inquiry to Richard Somerville, a professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, who emailed us calling Smitherman’s claim "nonsense." Somerville wrote: "It is just plain foolish to focus on short-term distractions in the climate record due to natural variability, while ignoring the long term-trend due to human activities." Somerville described Smitherman’s offered articles as unscientific, adding: "They misrepresent or ignore what climate science has actually discovered(.)" By email, Craighead of Smitherman’s campaign responded by stressing afresh the Easterbook presentation indicating a global cooling period since 1999. Our ruling Smitherman said the Earth is not warming. To the contrary, national, international and Texas climate authorities concur that the planet is warming. They also warn against cherry-picking individual climatic indicators or timeframes to conclude otherwise. That makes sense to us. In the end, this claim strikes us as both unfounded and ridiculous. Pants on Fire! PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. CLARIFICATION, 10:36 a.m., Dec. 13, 2013: This story was amended to show that Nielsen-Gammon was referring to a steady rise in ocean heat content, not surface temperatures.

pomt-01209	"Texas had the worst voter participation in the country" in the November 2014 elections.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/nov/25/jason-stanford/democratic-consultant-says-texas-had-nations-lowes/	A Democratic strategist partly attributed his party’s worse-than-expected loss in the Texas governor’s race to low voter turnout. Jason Stanford, a political consultant, researcher and former gubernatorial campaign manager, said in a commentary in the Nov. 17, 2014, Austin American-Statesman that millions of Texans had "slept through the election." In fact, Stanford declared, "Texas had the worst voter participation in the country." The Lone Star State has a reputation for light voter interest, but did it sport the worst turnout in the nation in 2014? It very likely may have, we discovered, but it’s too early to know for sure. Weak track record In recent years, the percentage of Texans turning out to vote in statewide elections was among the lowest in the country. According to a 2013 Texas Civic Health Index report by the Annette Strauss Institute for Civic Life at the University of Texas, Texas ranked last in voter turnout in the 2010 election. Citing U.S. Census Bureau information based on voter surveys every even-numbered year, the report said Texas ranked 48th in turnout in 2012, 47th in 2008 and 49th in 2006. The 2014 survey results are yet to be reported. It’s not just Texas that’s experienced low voter turnout. According to a Nov. 11, 2014, editorial in the New York Times, the November 2014 election saw the smallest share of eligible-to-vote Americans turn out to vote--36.3 percent--since the mid-term election year of 1942. Stanford’s backup Stanford, asked where his numbers came from, directed us to a Nov. 6, 2014, news blog post by the Dallas Observer, an alternative news weekly. Its story, titled "Texas Had the Worst Voter Turnout in the Country, and the Rain in Dallas Didn’t Help," posted data from the Florida-based United States Elections Project, a one-man operation from University of Florida political scientist Michael McDonald that’s reported voter turnout by state since 2000. According to the Elections Project, Texas sustained the nation’s second-lowest turnout rate of 28.5 percent, trailing only Indiana, which landed at 28 percent. In contrast, numbers from the Texas Secretary of State suggest nearly 34 percent turnout in Texas. What explains the difference? McDonald’s project looks at the share of voters eligible to vote, registered or not, as its base, while the state presents the share of registered voters (a smaller group) as its base. By phone, McDonald said many states base announced turnout percentages on the registered voter population because that number is easily accessible and doesn’t require calculations based on estimates by the Census Bureau. On the Elections Project website, McDonald calls turnout rates for registered voters alone "uninformative for comparison purposes" because voter registration practices vary across states (North Dakota, for instance, requires no voter registration). Also, McDonald writes, voter registration rolls include double entries because the records don’t always catch up to voters changing residences and they often list voters who have left the state. Many Americans could vote but don’t bother to register. Al Jazeera America reported on Nov. 5, 2014, that 70 million Americans who qualified to vote did not register for the 2014 election and, hence, were excluded from voter turnout calculations based on the share of registered voters who cast ballots. For his analysis of each state, McDonald said, he reached his turnout estimates by considering the number of votes cast in the statewide race generating the highest participation -- which in Texas was the governor’s race (also the race used by the Texas Secretary of State to calculate turnout, office spokeswoman Alicia Pierce told us by phone). By phone, Observer reporter Stephen Young told us he declared Texas’ voter turnout the nation’s lowest for the year because that appears to hold for the 36 states that had gubernatorial elections, which he said draw more voters in non-presidential election years than balloting in states lacking those marquee races. Indiana (the state with lower turnout than Texas) was among the 14 states lacking a vote for governor. Calculating voter turnout Our research showed there is no universally agreed-upon method of calculating voter turnout. Some groups use a state’s voting-age population to determine turnout; others, like the Elections Project and the Census Bureau, start from adults eligible to vote by estimating and subtracting adults legally ineligible to vote including felons and non-citizens. Others, like many state governments, calculate the portion of registered voters who voted in a given race. In a 2012 survey, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, an independent clearinghouse of elections information, asked each state to report its voting statistics. The EAC compiled the responses and ranked Texas 47th in turnout among voting-age citizens (ahead of West Virginia, Hawaii, New Mexico and Mississippi). A wrinkle to consider when talking turnout is that voters participate in voting for some offices more than others. Of Texas’ 14,025,441 registered voters as of November 2014, about 4.7 million voters participated in the gubernatorial election while about 4.6 million made a choice in the race for U.S. senator (even though it topped the ballot); down the ballot, a little more than 3.7 million votes were cast for one of the Texas Supreme Court seats, according to unofficial results. Historically, the Texas Secretary of State reports the turnout of registered voters and turnout of the voting-age population, though the state has yet to calculate the latter figure for the 2014 elections. The Strauss Institute report was based on census bureau data gathered by a phone survey in which residents were asked questions to determine if they were eligible to vote, then were asked if they’d voted. The report said: "While other ways of measuring voting rates are available, each calculates the ‘eligible’ population—the denominator in the fraction—differently." We asked McDonald precisely how he whittles Census Bureau population estimates down to the estimated number of adults eligible to vote in each state and then how he quickly establishes turnout percentages. By phone, McDonald said: -He begins with the voting-age population and subtracts population estimates for demographics that are ineligible to vote, like felons and non-citizens. -He calculates each state’s number of eligible voters in the months before an election, then uses vote counts reported by the Associated Press after election night and historical data from past elections to call voter turnout before all votes are counted. -He cautions that no turnout numbers will be official until states report total ballots cast to the Election Assistance Commission--probably by late 2015--so for now, the Texas numbers are an estimate. Independent confirmation We sought to compare the Elections Project estimates of voter turnout with other analyses, nearly coming up empty. Officials with groups we queried--the Pew Research Center, the Voter Participation Project, the Election Assistance Commission and the Texas Tribune--said they relied on the project’s figures. By phone, Curtis Gans, who has led the Center for the Study of the American Electorate at American University in Washington, D.C, since at least 1976, told us preliminary data collected by the center for 2014 didn’t conclusively show Texas, which hasn’t yet finished counting ballots, would have the nation’s worst voter turnout. "Texas has been near the bottom for many years, but I’m not sure if it’s at the bottom this year," Gans said. "In any case, it will be near the bottom." He said the center would release its voter turnout data within weeks. He said other states with historically low turnout, like New York and California, also haven’t finished counting ballots. As of Nov. 7, 2014, three days after the elections, the Elections Project said, 31.8 percent of California’s 24,408,163 eligible-to-vote citizens had turned out for the 2014 election, while 28.8 percent of New York’s 13,563,172 had voted. Our ruling Stanford said that in November 2014, "Texas had the worst voter participation in the country." According to the respected Elections Project, Texas appears to have had the lowest voter participation among states with a governor’s race. Among all states, though, Indiana appears to have had lower turnout--and besides, voting statistics aren’t final. We rate Stanford’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-00101	"There have been 44 plans submitted affecting 90 school districts. And the Scott administration has rejected all of them."	false	/vermont/statements/2018/oct/30/christine-hallquist/did-vermonts-governor-reject-every-school-merger-a/	Vermont is now in the final phase of implementing Act 46, a law requiring school boards to consolidate to form larger districts. The mergers are meant to encourage schools to share resources and save money. The state has some of the highest per-pupil costs in the country, and before this reform, it had the smallest ratio of school-board members to students. The process has been contentious, and debate over the mergers has spilled over to the gubernatorial race. Democratic gubernatorial nominee Christine Hallquist has accused Republican Gov. Phil Scott of being heavy-handed in his efforts to contain education spending in his first term. She hammered that theme home earlier this month, accusing the Scott administration of rejecting all alternative governance proposals for districts that have refused to merge. "There have been 44 plans submitted affecting 90 school districts. And the Scott administration has rejected all of them. We would definitely have a more flexible approach," she said at a press conference on October 10 in Burlington. She repeated a version of that claim later that day in a debate with Scott held in Rutland. That made us wonder – did Scott really say no to every district that asked for a reprieve under the consolidation law? We reached out to the Hallquist campaign, which pointed to a report by Vermonters for Schools and Community, which claimed "communities seeking approval for an alternative governance structure had a right to have their good faith effort be given a good faith evaluation. Instead, all were rejected." The Secretary of Education has, as required by the law, submitted a recommended plan to the State Board for unmerged districts. And that’s the plan attacked in the Vermonters for Schools and Community report cited by the Hallquist campaign. But the Scott administration has no power to reject or approve alternative structures. The Vermont State Board of Education has the final say over districts that have not voluntarily merged. Moreover, in multiple instances, Scott's secretary of the Agency of Education agreed with districts which submitted alternative governance proposals that they should retain their current structures. Take Hartland and Weathersfield in the Upper Valley, for instance. The neighboring K-8 districts asked the state to allow them to remain single-town, stand-alone districts. In the agency’s proposed plan, then-interim Secretary Heather Bouchey wrote that while a merger between the two districts was legally possible, it wouldn’t make much sense to consolidate the two since each town had little in common and tuitioned their children to different high schools. "Because there does not appear to be any commitment of the communities to create a new definition of ‘us,’ there is scant likelihood that they will realize the potential opportunities of a larger, more flexible unified structure," Bouchey wrote. In nearly half of all cases, the secretary recommended that the State Board do precisely what districts had asked for in their proposals. So why did the report argue that the alternative proposals were all rejected? The Hallquist campaign said that Margaret MacLean, an education consultant and activist with Vermonters for Schools and Community, was their point person on Act 46. Here’s how MacLean explained, earlier this summer, why the group claims all AGS proposals were rejected: "The secretary recommended forced merger or no action. She recommended zero for approval," she wrote in an email to VTDigger. MacLean’s general argument is that a fair appraisal of AGS proposals by the state would have included a rubric for vetting whether districts had shown they could meet the goals of the law – like cost-efficiency and equity – without merging, and then made recommendations accordingly. While the group is free to argue with how the secretary decided to make her recommendations, it isn’t fair to say the agency "rejected" all alternative proposals. In 21 cases, the secretary agreed with districts who submitted alternative governance proposals asking to keep their governance structures as-is. Our ruling Christine Hallquist accused Gov. Phil Scott of rejecting all alternative governance proposals under Act 46. But that statement was based on misleading rhetoric by anti-merger advocates. And in 21 cases, the Secretary of Education agreed with districts who submitted alternative proposals that they could retain their existing structure, and did not recommend forced mergers to the State Board. We rate this claim as False. Update Following the publication of this fact-check, Christine Hallquist send out a press release retracting her statement, thanking VTDigger reporter Lola Duffort for the article and celebrating the role of the press in political discourse. "I appreciate when the press holds both me and Governor Scott accountable when we make mistakes, as they should. This makes us better and serves the Vermont public," she said. "Governor Scott and his administration have been very heavy handed on public schools, but Duffort is absolutely correct that he did not, as I stated, reject every Act 46 Alternative Governance proposal. I apologize and retract this claim. In this, as in all matters of policy, I am open to new information and new evidence that will serve to better any proposals I put forward."

pomt-09997	"There has been no net global warming for over a decade now."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/apr/01/cato-institute/cato-institutes-claim-global-warming-disputed-most/	A recent full-page newspaper ad from the libertarian Cato Institute takes issue with President Barack Obama's convictions about global warming. The ad cites then-President-elect Obama's Nov. 19 statement: "Few challenges facing America and the world are more urgent than combating climate change. The science is beyond dispute and the facts are clear." "With all due respect, Mr. President, that is not true," the ad states in bold letters. Below that is a statement they say was signed off on by more than 100 named scientists. "We, the undersigned scientists, maintain that the case for alarm regarding climate change is grossly overstated. Surface temperature changes over the past century have been episodic and modest and there has been no net global warming for over a decade now. After controlling for population growth and property values, there has been no increase in damages from severe weather-related events. The computer models forecasting rapid temperature change abjectly fail to explain recent climate behavior. Mr. President, your characterization of the scientific facts regarding climate change and the degree of certainty informing the scientific debate is simply incorrect." Global warming is a complicated subject, and we're not going to flesh it all out here. But we did want to address the underpinning of this ad, the claim that "there has been no net global warming for over a decade now." First off, we should note that while there are some who disagree about the existence of global warming, the overwhelming consensus among scientists who study the climate is that it does, and that humans are worsening it. The definitive statement on global warming comes from a 2007 study by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of scientists from more than 130 nations. They concluded that the "warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice and rising global average sea level." The group also concluded that there is "very high confidence that the global average net effect of human activities since 1750 has been one of warming." The problem with the assertion in the Cato statement is that it is impossible to make meaningful conclusions about climate trends based on looking at a 10-year window, said Richard Heim, a meteorologist at the NOAA National Climatic Data Center Climate Monitoring Branch. People tend to think of global warming as a steady trend upward, Heim said, but that's not how it works. if you were to look at long-term trends, like a century, it looks more like steps. Temperatures wil rise for a few years, then level off or even go down a little bit, then go back up. That's why you've got to look at temperatures over many decades, he said. And if you look at the trends over the last 100 years, Heim said, "the overall linear trend shows clear, unequivocal, unmistakable warming over that period." Take a look for yourself at the NOAA graph of 100 years of global temperatures. Now, over the last dozen years, he said, global temperatures have largely plateaued. That's consistent with the trends. Typically, he said, climates will go up, then plateau until they reach a tipping point, and then rise again. "What you are seeing in the last eight or 10 years is kind of like one of those steps," Heim said. "The fact that it's not getting warmer doesn't mean we are not experiencing global warming. You can't talk about global warming over a 10 year period. The time scale is too short." When you grab short time frames, say 10 years, it's easy to cherry-pick starting points that are particularly high or low to make your argument one way or the other. But even if you did select a 10-year frame — as cited by Cato — it would show a slight warming over time, Heim said. If you looked at just the last eight years, it would look flat. In fact, if you looked at the last four years, it would seem to be cooling. "But this is crazy," Heim said. "You have to look at the big picture." Gavin Schmidt, a NASA climate scientist who was a reviewer on the IPCC study, called the Cato argument that there has been no global warming over the last 10 years "fatuous and false." "What if I said that there had been no global warming for an hour? You would rightly tell me that this was too short a period for it to be meaningful," Schmidt said. "The same is true for a 'decade'. But even so, it is false." Schmidt directed us to a graph showing the 10-year climate trends using the four main temperature indices. The line bounces up and down like a lie detector graph, but the overall lines all trend upward . "To be clear, the globe has warmed for the last decade," Schmidt said. "You can get different results if you pick out your start dates carefully, a practice known as cherry-picking since it is trying to use the data to say something other than what it generally shows, but you are much better off looking at the longest time scales you have (such as these from NASA )." Cato cited a study on the internal variability of the climate system to support its claim. But the paper, from Kyle Swanson and Anastasios Tsonis, doesn't dispute the long-term trend of climate change, Schmidt said. He cited this conclusion from the paper: "If the role of internal variability in the climate system is as large as this analysis would seem to suggest, warming over the 21st century may well be larger than that predicted by the current generation of models, given the propensity of those models to underestimate climate internal variability." Said Schmidt: "Quoting this paper to support a claim that global warming has stopped is like quoting Ronald McDonald in support of vegetarianism." In conclusion, most scientists who study climate say that cherry-picking a 10-year window is inappropriate. But in this case, cherry picking exactly 10 years (Cato said a decade) still doesn't support their claim. We rate this claim False.

pomt-05425	Says Mitt Romney's comments indicated he would not have pursued Osama bin Laden.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/30/barack-obama/obama-ad-says-mitt-romneys-view-killing-bin-laden/	A Web ad from President Barack Obama’s campaign about the death of Osama bin Laden asks, "Which path would Mitt Romney have taken?" The ad features former President Bill Clinton saying Obama "took the harder, and more honorable path," when he approved the May 2, 2011, strike that killed the terrorist mastermind. By contrast, it portrays Romney as less committed to the effort to kill the al-Qaida leader. It says Romney once criticized Obama for "vowing to strike al-Qaida targets inside Pakistan if necessary." Then it shows a clip of CNN’s Wolf Blitzer quoting Romney as saying in April 2007, "It's not worth moving heaven and earth and spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person." By using that quote, the ad indicates that Romney would not have pursued the al-Qaida leader. Indeed, that's how headlines described the April 27, 2012, ad. A conservative blogger pounced on the ad's implication, saying it took Romney’s "heaven and earth" quote out of context. (That charge was also levied back in 2007 about the Associated Press story that quoted Romney in the first place.) Fox News followed, saying "Obama campaign's bin Laden ad omits Romney clarification on key quote." We wondered: Did the ad accurately characterize Romney’s "heaven and earth" quote? Was he really lukewarm — or even opposed — to the effort to get bin Laden? The AP interview There’s no dispute that Romney said about bin Laden, "It's not worth moving heaven and earth and spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person." But was he saying he wouldn’t pursue the terrorist? The quote comes from an Associated Press story on April 26, 2007, about a Romney interview with reporter Liz Sidoti that covered a range of topics. Here’s the related passage: In the interview, Romney also: Said the country would be safer by only "a small percentage" and would see "a very insignificant increase in safety" if al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden was caught because another terrorist would rise to power. "It's not worth moving heaven and earth spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person," Romney said. Instead, he said he supports a broader strategy to defeat the Islamic jihad movement. At the time, Democrats such as Obama were criticizing President George W. Bush for failing to find bin Laden. Republicans, in turn, were critical of Obama's focus on capturing or killing the terrorist leader. A post from the conservative site Townhall.com in 2007 says it got a transcript from Romney’s campaign at the time that shows he followed the "heaven and earth" line with the sentence: "It is worth fashioning and executing an effective strategy to defeat global, violent Jihad and I have a plan for doing that." Later, he explains, "Global jihad … involves millions of people and is going to require a far more comprehensive strategy than a targeted approach for bin Laden or a few of his associates." Sidoti, now AP’s political editor, couldn’t confirm the accuracy of the transcript for us, and Romney’s campaign didn’t respond to our inquiry. Lucky for us, Romney himself had a chance to clarify his words just days after he spoke them, in a May 4, 2007, Republican presidential debate. The moderator of the MSNBC debate, which featured nine Republicans, brought up Romney’s "heaven and earth" quote, which rival Arizona Sen. John McCain had called "naive." MODERATOR: "Gov. Romney, respond to the mentioned reference to you ... by Sen. McCain." ROMNEY: "Thank you. Of course we get Osama bin Laden and track him wherever he has to go, and make sure he pays for the outrage he exacted upon America." MODERATOR: "Can we move heaven and earth to do it?" ROMNEY: "We'll move everything to get him. But I don't want to buy into the Democratic pitch that this is all about one person — Osama bin Laden — because after we get him, there's going to be another and another. This is about Shia and Sunni. This is about Hezbollah and Hamas and al-Qaida and the Muslim Brotherhood. This is a worldwide jihadist effort to try and cause the collapse of all moderate Islamic governments and replace them with a caliphate. "They ultimately want to bring down the United States of America. "This is a global effort we're going to have to lead to overcome this jihadist effort. It's more than Osama bin Laden. "But he is going to pay, and he will die." That suggests Romney was criticizing Democrats for focusing too much on the al-Qaida leader rather than the full organization and would have aggressively pursued bin Laden in the context of a larger antiterror strategy. Still, Romney suggested just a few months later that he wouldn’t do what Obama ultimately did — call for a secret, unilateral Navy SEALs strike inside Pakistan. In 2007, Obama had said that if he were elected president, he would be willing to launch strikes against al-Qaida targets in Pakistan with or without Pakistan’s approval. An Aug. 4, 2007, headline from Reuters — an article cited by Obama’s ad — says, "Romney attacks Obama over Pakistan warning." Romney called Obama's comments ‘ill-timed’ and ‘ill-considered,’" Reuters reported, along with other news services. "There is a war being waged by terrorists of different types and nature across the world," Romney said, according to Reuters. "We want, as a civilized world, to participate with other nations in this civilized effort to help those nations reject the extreme with them." Romney "said U.S. troops ‘shouldn't be sent all over the world.'" Other Republicans (and Democrat Hillary Clinton) had the same complaint, with some going so far as to say Obama "wants to bomb Pakistan," a statement we rated Pants on Fire. The Obama campaign, on the other hand, had issued a memo that the United States had deferred to the Pakistani president’s judgment long enough, and that, "Barack Obama wants to turn the page," Reuters reported. Our ruling An Obama campaign ad suggested Mitt Romney wouldn’t have agressively pursued Osama bin Laden by citing Romney's statement that, "It's not worth moving heaven and earth and spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person." The Obama campaign is right that Romney used those words, but by cherry-picking them, it glosses over comments describing his broader approach. Romney said he wanted to pursue all of al-Qaida, not just its leaders. The reporter quoting him in April 2007 said he instead "endorsed a broader strategy to defeat the Islamic jihad movement." And he said just over a week later that he would "get Osama bin Laden and track him wherever he has to go, and make sure he pays for the outrage he exacted upon America … he is going to pay, and he will die." Still, Romney was clear later that summer that he would prefer to participate with allies rather than take unilateral action to kill terrorists as Obama supported — and later did. The ad takes Romney’s words out of context, but gets part of the story right. We rate it Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-04-30T12:14:58	2012-04-27	['Osama_bin_Laden']
pomt-05937	"Eric Holder is supportive of the NAACP's efforts to get the United Nations involved in our elections."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2012/jan/27/true-vote/true-vote-says-eric-holder-supports-naacp-request-/	Eric Holder, the U.S. attorney general, supports a group’s push for international involvement in U.S. elections, a Texas-rooted organization says. On a web page urging supporters to protest Holder’s Dec. 13, 2011, stop in Austin, True the Vote said Holder "is for NAACP plans to involve the United Nations in U.S. elections. "Are you ready to have U.N. blue helmets outside your polling place?" Not us. While pondering that possibility, we wondered whether True the Vote, a national conservative poll watchers group that grew out of 2008 efforts to monitor Houston polling places, is right about the government’s lead lawyer backing such an endeavor. Catherine Engelbrecht of Richmond, Texas, True the Vote’s leader, told us in a telephone interview that she learned of the NAACP’s interest in enlisting the U.N. from a Dec. 5, 2011, news article posted by a British news source, the Guardian. That story, which makes no mention of Holder, says the NAACP is petitioning the U.N. over what it sees as a concerted effort through changes in election laws to disenfranchise black and Latino voters ahead of the 2012 presidential election. Eric Wrobel, an NAACP spokesman, told us by email that the NAACP held a "Stand for Freedom" march in New York on Dec. 10, 2011, culminating in a rally across the street from the UN. Wrobel pointed us to an NAACP web page promoting the march stating that "it’s time to Stand for Freedom. We must protect our right to vote." A Nov. 8, 2011, press release promoting the event calls Stand for Freedom a voting rights campaign bringing together the NAACP and other groups in "an aggressive nationwide effort to stop changes to state election laws that would suppress the rights of millions of Americans to vote." At issue, the release says, are state efforts reducing early voting opportunities and voting on Sundays plus new mandates in some states that voters present photo IDs before being allowed to cast ballots. In the release, Todd Jealous, president of the NAACP, says: ""We are in the midst of the greatest coordinated legislative attack on voting rights since the dawn of Jim Crow. Voter ID laws are nothing but reincarnated poll taxes and literacy tests, and ex-felon voting bans serve the same purpose today as when they were created in the wake of the 15th Amendment guaranteeing ex-slaves the vote—suppressing voting numbers among people of color." Holder goes unmentioned in the press release -- and also did not mention the NAACP effort in his subsequent Austin speech, which otherwise underscored his interest in protecting minority voting rights. Most immediately, Holder said, the Justice Department was reviewing voter ID laws approved last year in states including Texas and South Carolina. He said the reviews are in keeping with provisions of the Voting Rights Act, which applies to parts of all of 16 states with a history of voter discrimination and requires changes in election laws in the jurisdictions to be pre-cleared by federal judges or the department before taking effect. "If a state passes a new voting law and meets its burden of showing that the law is not discriminatory," Holder said, "we will follow the law and approve the change. And where a state can’t meet this burden, we will object." Ten days later, the department deemed South Carolina’s voter ID law discriminatory because the state’s registered minority voters are nearly 20 percent more likely than whites to lack a state-issued photo ID, according to a news article posted online Dec. 23, 2011 by The Washington Post. "The absolute number of minority citizens whose exercise of the franchise could be adversely affected by the proposed requirements runs into the tens of thousands," Assistant Attorney General Thomas E. Perez said in a letter to South Carolina officials, the Post reported. According to the Post account, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a Republican, called the agency’s decision "outrageous" and said she plans to seek "every possible option to get this terrible, clearly political decision overturned so we can protect the integrity of our electoral process and our 10th Amendment rights." Back to the NAACP: A "Take Action" section of the NAACP’s Stand for Freedom website urges visitors to sign the "Stand for Freedom Pledge" and "protect the right to vote in your community." The pledge calls, in part, for the Justice Department to enforce the Voting Rights Act; for Congress to pass legislation advancing all Americans' right to vote and making it easier for working people to cast their ballot; and for state legislatures and governors to repeal every voter suppression measure and pass and implement measures to increase voter participation. It also calls for the "United Nations to investigate and condemn voter suppression tactics in the United States." And has Holder endorsed the pledge? We found no sign of that in a Nexis search of news articles. In response to our inquiry, Xochitl Hinojosa, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said by email that the agency has not taken a position on the NAACP’s request to the U.N. Separately, Hilary Shelton, the NAACP’s Washington Bureau director and senior vice president for advocacy and policy, told us in a telephone interview that while he attended Holder’s speech and the NAACP has met frequently with Justice Department officials about protecting U.S. voting and civil rights, the group has not brought up its call for U.N. officials to monitor U.S. elections with Holder or the Justice Department: "There has not been a request from the NAACP" for Holder to join the plea for U.N. interest, Shelton said, nor have department officials voiced support. "We don’t see that as a role for" the Justice Department, Shelton said. "So we didn’t ask them... At none of these meetings do I recall the United Nations even being mentioned." Shelton said too that the NAACP has no desire for U.N. troops to occupy U.S polling places, though it would like researchers to gauge whether American citizens are being dissuaded or prevented from voting due to election laws. Ideally, he said, such researchers would occasionally monitor polling sites -- starting as soon as this spring’s party primaries -- in "hot spots" including Texas. Shelton said in a follow-up interview that in 2004, the U.N. monitored presidential balloting in the United States, focusing on Florida. However, according to a July 9, 2004, news article from the Press Trust of India, the U.N. declined to deploy observers after fielding a request from 13 Democratic U.S. House members. The Press Trust article quotes an unidentified U.N. spokesman saying: "The policy and practice is that the United Nations responds to requests made by national governments and not by the legislative branch. Besides, the observation must be mandated by the 191-member (U.N.) General Assembly as the activity also affects the sovereign jurisdiction of that country." Shelton said the U.N. has not yet aired a position on the recently presented pledge, which he said nearly 40,000 people had endorsed as of Jan. 23, 2012. Engelbrecht, informed that neither the DOJ or NAACP had confirmed Holder’s support of the group’s U.N. request, guided us to Virginia lawyer Christian Adams, who quit the Justice Department’s civil rights division in 2009 after voter-intimidation charges were dropped against two African American activists who had stood outside a Philadelphia polling place in November 2008, one of them wielding a baton, according to an Oct. 23, 2010, news article in The Washington Post. In an interview, Adams said U.N. officials have met with DOJ officials; such meetings occurred when he was still working for the government, he said. The U.N. "has spent a good deal of time and effort investigating American elections," Adams said. "That’s a fact." He urged us to ask the Justice Department for confirmation. We asked the Justice Department’s Hinojosa if any part of Adams’ claim was accurate. Hinojosa said by email: "We are unaware of any recent meetings between Justice Department officials and U.N. officials specifically on voting issues." He did not reply to our request to define "recent." Similarly, we asked the U.N. if its officials have been investigating U.S. elections or meeting with Justice Department officials about them. Rupert Colville, spokesman for the Geneva-based U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, replied by email: "I very much doubt it," though he said he couldn’t speak for the entire "big and complex" U.N. system. So, the Justice Department says there have been no recent meetings, while a U.N. spokesman is doubtful. As we completed this review, True the Vote’s Engelbrecht stood by the group’s claim that Holder supports the NAACP's efforts to get the U.N. involved in U.S. elections. Our ruling True the Vote provided no evidence for its Holder claim while our own inquiries landed no confirmation -- nor anything close. Holder and the NAACP both say minority voting rights should be protected. But the idea that Holder backs the group’s call for a U.N. investigation appears to be without basis. Indeed, if this claim was factual, it would be national and international news. Instead, the statement is ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-11486	Says 97 percent of gun owners support universal background checks.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/mar/02/tammy-baldwin/mostly-target-claim-97-percent-gun-owners-support-/	Students planning a national school walkout, angry that more hasn’t been done to protect them from school shootings, might have more support from adults than they realize when it comes to gun control. The walkouts are planned for March 14, 2018, the one-month anniversary of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 people dead. Speaking about Parkland, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who is being challenged by two Republicans in her bid for re-election, made a claim about background checks that might sound extreme. At a WisPolitics event on Feb. 22, 2018, eight days after the shooting, the Wisconsin Democrat said: We know that we need change. And it’s frustrating because there is a high level of consensus across America on the sort of common-sense safety measures that need to be brought up and passed. Among gun owners -- and I'm a gun owner myself -- 97 percent support expanded, universal background checks so we don’t have the gun-show loophole, so that we don’t have the internet purchases that don’t go through a thorough background check. To reiterate, Baldwin’s claim is about support among gun owners, not just the general public, for requiring background checks for all gun sales, not just those done by federally licensed dealers. Prior fact checks Four months before the Florida school shooting, we rated True a claim by Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele that 90 percent of Americans "support universal background checks" for gun purchases. We found a half dozen national polls that showed support at or near 90 percent. And an October 2017 poll taken by Gallup after Abele made his claim found support at 96 percent. But that’s the general public. What about gun owners? Quinnipiac poll To back Baldwin’s claim, her campaign cited a national telephone poll by Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Conn., of 1,249 people who identified themselves as registered voters. The poll, done with live interviews on landlines and cell phones, was taken over four consecutive days, starting Feb. 16, 2018 -- two days after the school shooting in Parkland. The question: "Do you support or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers?" Before we get to the results, there is one wrinkle here: Respondents weren’t asked if they were gun owners themselves; rather, they were asked if they, or anyone in their home, owns a gun. The result was 97 percent support among gun households (as well as 97 percent among all respondents in the poll). The margin of error for the gun households (which made up 555 of the 1,249 total respondents) was plus or minus 5 percentage points. Three polling experts -- Marquette Law School Poll director Charles Franklin, Karlyn Bowman at the American Enterprise Institute and Janine Parry, director of the Arkansas Poll -- told us they were not aware of any other national polls done in recent months that published results about gun owner support of universal background checks. We did find a poll of people who identified themselves as gun owners, by the Pew Research Center, which asked: "Would you strongly favor, somewhat favor, somewhat oppose, or strongly oppose making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks?" The result: 77 percent of gun owners strongly or somewhat favored. But that poll was taken in March 2017, 11 months before the Parkland shooting. It’s tempting to think that support reached 97 percent in the Quinnipiac poll simply because it was taken days after the Parkland shooting. But Quinnipiac’s results have been consistent. For example, support was 94 percent among gun households in Quinnipiac’s December 2017 and November 2017 polls, the most recent ones done before the February 2018 poll. Our rating Baldwin says "97 percent" of gun owners support universal background checks.

pomt-03875	"The president is advocating a drone strike program in America."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/07/rand-paul/sen-rand-paul-says-obama-advocating-drone-strike-p/	Sen. Rand Paul’s filibuster on March 6, 2013, expanded from the Senate floor to Twitter, where he, among other things, accused President Barack Obama of "advocating a drone strike program in America." The Republican from Kentucky spoke for nearly 13 hours until the early morning on March 7 to keep senators from voting on the nomination of White House counterterrorism chief John Brennan for CIA director. The subject of Paul’s concern: a letter from the attorney general that didn’t appear to rule out drone strikes against U.S. citizens on American soil. "No American should be killed by a drone on American soil without first being charged with a crime, without first being found to be guilty by a court," Paul said. By mid afternoon March 7, the attorney general released a new letter clarifying the administration's stance, Paul declared victory, and the Senate voted to confirm Brennan, 63 to 34. (Paul voted no.) The Senate logjam may have broken, but we still wondered: Has President Barack Obama been "advocating a drone strike program in America"? What the administration says We asked Paul’s office to explain his tweet, but we didn’t hear back. His full Twitter comment said: "The President is advocating a drone strike program in America. All we have to compare it with is the drone strike program overseas." However, during his filibuster, Paul mentioned a March letter from Attorney General Eric Holder as well as testimony from Brennan’s February confirmation hearing. The senator had sought the administration’s views on whether 'the president has the power to authorize lethal force, such as a drone strike, against a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil, and without trial." Armed drones — remote-controlled, pilotless aircraft — are used by the U.S. to kill enemies overseas, with hundreds of strikes in multiple countries in the last decade. Brennan has said, "In this armed conflict, individuals who are part of al-Qaida or its associated forces are legitimate military targets." In at least one case, the target was American. Paul wanted assurance that strikes wouldn’t be made against Americans in the United States. On March 4, Holder responded to Paul, writing that the United States hadn’t carried out such drone strikes and did not intend to. "As a policy matter, moreover, we reject the use of military force where well-established law enforcement authorities in this country provide the best means for incapacitating a terrorist threat," Holder wrote. But, Holder wrote, he could "imagine an extraordinary circumstance in which it would be necessary and appropriate under the Constitution and applicable laws of the United States for the President to authorize the military to use lethal force within the territory of the United States." "For example," he continued, "the President could conceivably have no choice but to authorize the military to use such force if necessary to protect the homeland in the circumstances of a catastrophic attack like the ones suffered on December 7, 1941, and September 11, 2001. "Were such an emergency to arise, I would examine the particular facts and circumstances before advising the President on the scope of his authority." Brennan had offered a similar explanation in response to lawmakers’ questions before his February hearing. A senator had asked, "Could the administration carry out drone strikes inside the United States?" Brennan’s reply: "This administration has not carried out drone strikes inside the United States and has no intention of doing so." (Note that he did not say whether it "could," only that it hadn’t and didn’t intend to.) Asked to describe the "geographical limits" on the administration’s drone strikes, Brennan noted, in part, "the government has a responsibility to protect its citizens from these attacks, and, thus, as the attorney general has noted, ‘neither Congress nor our federal courts has limited the geographic scope of our ability to use force to the current conflict in Afghanistan.’" But he went on to say: "This does not mean, however, that we use military force whenever or wherever we want. International legal principles, such as respect for another nation’s sovereignty, constrain our ability to act unilaterally. Using force in another country is consistent with these international legal principles if conducted, for example, with the consent of the relevant nation – or if or when other governments are unwilling or unable to deal effectively with a threat to the United States." We asked the White House for its response to Paul’s assertion that the president was "advocating a drone strike program in America." "On the record, that claim is false," said Caitlin Hayden, spokesperson for the National Security Council. She also pointed to Brennan’s speeches and nomination testimony, as well as letters by Holder. We reviewed earlier Brennan speeches — such as the one in which he acknowledged the government’s overseas drone program — as well as speeches and news briefings by Obama and his press secretaries Robert Gibbs and Jay Carney. We found nothing to indicate the administration was "advocating" domestic drone strikes. The most direct statements we saw from the administration on the idea of domestic drone strikes came from Brennan’s nomination testimony and Holder’s letters. Holder’s second letter to Paul, the day after his filibuster and tweet, said: "It has come to my attention that you have now asked an additional question: 'Does the President have the authority to use a weaponized drone to kill an American not engaged in combat on American soil?' The answer to that question is no." (Paul declared the statement "a major victory," though it doesn’t address what authority the administration claims against citizens on U.S. soil it deems to be a "legitimate military target.") We also asked eight experts in drone-strike policy and law whether they thought Paul was correct that the Obama administration was "advocating a drone strike program in America." None of them did. "Holder, in his testimony, said that in theory the administration could engage in a targeted killing in the U.S.," said Michael C. Dorf, a Cornell University Law School professor. "But I don't think that counts as ‘advocating’" such a program. Steven Groves, a senior research fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation, agreed, saying it was "probably a stretch to say that the administration is ‘advocating’ a drone strike program in America" when in fact Paul’s most immediate concern was that Holder would not rule out the use of drone strikes against Americans on U.S. soil. The statement, Grove said, "may fairly be characterized as rhetorical flourishes." Paul Pillar, a veteran of the CIA who now teaches at Georgetown University, added that Paul’s statement "does not fairly reflect the extreme and extraordinary nature of the hypothetical circumstance that the attorney general was addressing." Our ruling Rand Paul tweeted that "the president is advocating a drone strike program in America." The attorney general and White House counterterrorism chief haven’t strictly ruled out the use of lethal force against U.S. citizens on American soil, but they said that it would take extraordinary circumstances. We — and all the experts we consulted — see no evidence that the administration is purposefully advancing the goal of a drone strike program in America. We rate Paul’s claim False.

pomt-12818	"Over 39% of violent criminals return to prison following their release."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/feb/10/joe-sanfelippo/joe-sanfelippo-39-percent-violent-criminals-return/	Three state lawmakers from southeastern Wisconsin want to toughen penalties on those who repeatedly commit violent crimes. "We know that habitual offenders are increasingly terrorizing our neighborhoods and preying on innocent victims," state Rep. Joe Sanfelippo (R-West Allis), a co-sponsor of the bill, said in a YouTube video uploaded Feb. 1, 2017. As Sanfelippo spoke, a graphic behind him caught our attention. It claimed that "Over 39% of violent criminals return to prison following their release." Repeat offenders To check the claim, we turned first to an official report on recidivism published by the Wisconsin Department of Corrections in September 2016. It tracks whether inmates are sentenced for a new crime after they are released from prison for an earlier offense. The report shows recidivism trends covering more than 156,000 offenders who were released from the Wisconsin correctional system between 1990 and 2013, Corrections Secretary Jon E. Litscher wrote in an introduction. Quick takeaway: Since the early 1990s, the percentage of inmates who are convicted of a new crime within three years of getting out of prison has fallen steadily. In the category of "violent" criminals, the Department of Corrections looked at those convicted of murder, non-negligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, negligent manslaughter, kidnapping, other sexual assault, simple assault, and other violent offenses including intimidation, illegal abortion, extortion, cruelty toward a child or wife and hit-and-run driving with bodily injury. Violent crimes do not include aggravated burglary or burglary, DOC spokesman Tristan Cook told us. The standards come from the Association of State Correctional Administrators (ASCA) Performance-Based Measures System. For those who committed violent crimes -- the group Sanfelippo is interested in -- 27.2% were considered recidivists, according to the latest state report. So does that mean Sanfelippo is way off target by saying "over 39% return to prison?" Not necessarily. There’s a wrinkle here related to the definition of "recidivism." Under the definition used in the report, recidivism means those who are convicted and sentenced for a new crime. That leaves out a whole category of offenders who return to prison without being convicted of a new crime. Typically they land in prison when their probation, parole or extended supervision is revoked by the state. When you factor in those cases, the rate was 39.7% in the most recent figures, according to the state Department of Corrections. It’s that calculation that Sanfelippo points to in backing up his claim. The state calls that the "reincarceration rate." It’s a commonly used measurement in incarceration research. And Sanfelippo’s phrasing in the video squares with that data. Another factor But there is one issue with his approach. Sanfelippo portrays these repeat violent offenders as "terrorizing our neighborhoods," but many who are sent back due to parole violations and related matters have done something that does not warrant a new criminal charge. Violent offenders are returned quite frequently for technical violations, in part because they are under more stringent supervision due to the serious nature of their offenses, said Thomas LeBel, a criminal justice expert at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. A Journal Sentinel investigation published in 2015 found the process that sends violators back behind bars relies largely on the judgment of individual parole agents, which can vary widely. Among the reincarcerated, more than half were imprisoned when their probation, parole or extended supervision was revoked, with no new conviction and sentencing, Corrections Department statistics show. In those types of cases, there was suspected criminal activity in about 70% of cases involving some 3,000 ex-offenders sent back to prison without being convicted of new crimes in 2015, Corrections Department statistics show. But technical violations are a factor too. They can include things such as accepting a job without permission, missing a meeting with a probation or parole officer, or leaving their home counties, according to a study by WISDOM, a statewide group of faith leaders and activists dedicated to prison reform. Indeed, some can wind up back in prison even if acquitted of charges in court. In February 2017, the Journal Sentinel wrote about Damien Payne, a Milwaukee man on state supervision after release from prison in 2010. Payne was found not guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm and of carrying a concealed weapon, but still was sent to prison for more than three years. A Corrections Department rule allows that action. Our rating Sanfelippo claimed that "over 39% of violent criminals return to prison following their release." The number tracks a credible report by the state, so it’s on target. But it needs clarification because Sanfelippo portrays the repeat offenders as "terrorizing" neighborhoods when some very likely were imprisoned anew for lesser violations. That’s our definition of Mostly True.

pomt-12467	Says John Quincy Adams said, "If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more, and become more, you are a leader."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/05/ivanka-trump/book-john-quincy-adams-quote/	Ivanka Trump’s new book Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success leans on a litany of inspirational quotes to help women balance their lives at home and the office. Featured voices include Walt Disney, Toni Morrison, Betty Friedan, Maya Angelou, Nelson Mandela, Estee Lauder, Sheryl Sandberg and our sixth president, John Quincy Adams. Trump used the following quote about leadership to tee off a passage about leading with purpose from any level: "If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more, and become more, you are a leader." John Quincy Adams Her decision to include this particular quote (page 179) may have been inspired by a 2015 tweet from her father, President Donald J. Trump. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The quote gets good play in leadership circles and memes online. And it looks somewhat legitimate when you Google "John Quincy Adams," appearing as the top quote. To our ears, you are more likely to hear this nugget of wisdom in management training than in the early period of our nation. We reached out to learn more from her publisher but did not hear back. While it’s impossible to prove someone never, ever said something, the quote has all the traces of being fake. The real person who said the quote, or at least a version of it, could be a woman known for celebrating her fake attributes, Dolly Parton. "I've never seen that from J. Q. Adams," said H. W. Brands, a University of Texas at Austin presidential historian and author. "It doesn't sound like him. He wasn't the dreamy type." Brands continued: "Adams had a rather crimped view of human nature. He thought most people were rascals. He disliked democracy because he thought it fostered pandering to people's baser instincts." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Collection of the Massachusetts Historical Society Adams was a prolific writer, in keeping with family tradition. He maintained a diary from 1779 to 1847, spanning more than 15,000 manuscript pages and 51 volumes. No, we did not read them all, nor did we review his complete correspondence and speeches from his time in the revolution and as a lawyer, diplomat, secretary of state, and president from 1825-1829. But we did talk with someone else well-versed in his considerable output: Sara Martin, editor in chief of The Adams Papers of the Massachusetts Historical Society. "I am confident that this is not a JQA quotation," she said. "It neither sounds like him, nor is it really the vein of political thought that he typically expresses in his quotations." She sent us real quotes from Adams relating to leadership to show the difference, backed up with links to his diary entries. (Here’s the whole list.) "But the man who expects that all mankind, or the circle in which he moves will treat him according to his real merits, must have very little experience in the ways of men." Diary entry from Aug. 8, 1787 "All zealots justify unworthy means by the sanctity of the end." Diary entry from Aug. 3, 1788 "A politician in this country must be the man of a party. I would fain be the man of my whole country." Diary entry from Jan. 28, 1802 "The tendency of all private associations to settle into factious cabals is the besetting sin of all elective governments." Diary from entry from Oct. 2, 1844 You get the picture. The most-detailed effort to track down the real source of the leadership quote was Quote Investigator in 2011. The website concluded that the quote likely evolved from a version used by Parton before it was assigned to Adams in its current form. Quote Investigator found that the 1997 book The Most Important Thing I Know quotes the singer and actor as offering, "If your actions create a legacy that inspires others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, then, you are an excellent leader." Our ruling The quotation Ivanka Trump chose, one of many, is a worthy reflection. But it was a silly and easily avoided mistake to assign the words to John Quincy Adams, as others on the internet have done, when there is no record of him saying it. There are a lot of other verified options. We rate this statement False. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com	None	Ivanka Trump	None	None	None	2017-05-05T16:02:18	2017-05-01	['None']
pomt-12794	On leaks and the release of secret information.	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/16/donald-trump/trumps-flip-flop-leaks-and-release-secret-informat/	"Boy, I love reading those WikiLeaks!" -- Nov. 4, 2016 "The spotlight has finally been put on the low-life leakers!" -- Feb. 16, 2017 During the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump couldn’t get enough of the private emails of senior Democrats released by WikiLeaks. "Boy, I love reading those WikiLeaks!" Trump said on Nov. 4 at a rally in Wilmington, Ohio. He also touted the fruits of WikiLeaks disclosures on Oct. 31 in Warren, Mich., on Nov. 2 in Orlando and Pensacola, Fla., and Nov. 6 in Sioux City, Iowa. Trump even called on Russia to locate and release emails by his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. "Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing," he said during a press conference at the Trump National Doral golf course on July 27. But now Trump is assailing leaks from the intelligence community to the New York Times that led to the quick departure of Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Flynn. The articles cited anonymous officials saying that during the presidential transition, Flynn had been in contact with Russia about the sanctions that had recently imposed by the Obama administration. At a Feb. 15 press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump lamented that Flynn -- "a wonderful man" -- had been treated "very, very unfairly" by the media. "Papers are being leaked, things are being leaked," Trump said. "It’s criminal actions ... and it’s been going on for a long time -- before me. But now it’s really going on, and people are trying to cover up for a terrible loss that the Democrats had under Hillary Clinton." He followed up with several tweets between Feb. 14 and 16, such as this one from Feb. 16: "Leaking, and even illegal classified leaking, has been a big problem in Washington for years. Failing @nytimes (and others) must apologize!" And at a press conference the same day, he spent time criticizing leaks. "The press should be ashamed of themselves" for running stories based on leaks, Trump told reporters. So is this a flip-flop? Before we start, we should emphasize that our Flip-O-Meter judges whether someone has been consistent on an issue. The rating is not making a value judgment, but simply noting if a change of position has happened. In this case, there are some differences between the election leaks and the leaks by the intelligence community. However, experts on national security told us that Trump has shown inconsistent standards. We’ll note that Trump doesn’t think it’s a change in position. Pressed on the question at his Feb. 16 news conference, Trump drew a distinction between the release of classified information (the leaks on Flynn and Russia) and the release of personal emails (WikiLeaks and the Democratic National Committee). "In one case, you're talking about highly classified information," Trump said. "In the other case, you're talking about (DNC chairman) John Podesta saying bad things about the boss (Clinton). I will say this: If John Podesta said that about me and he was working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun. He said terrible things about her. But it wasn't classified information. But in one case, you're talking about classified (material)." Trump has a point about the distinction. But that’s not the whole story. Though the DNC releases weren’t classified, Wikileaks has released classified information previously. That includes 750,000 pages of documents stolen by Chelsea Manning, then known as Bradley Manning. In other words, during the campaign Trump praised an organization that made its name by leaking classified information. Now he’s criticizing leaking. "He went from ‘I love WikiLeaks,’ an organization that publishes leaked classified information, to his current position," said Barnett Rubin, associate director of the Center on International Cooperation at New York University. "A few months ago, leaks were getting him elected -- now they are destroying" his presidency, agreed John Pike, director of globalsecurity.org. Robert F. Turner, associate director of the University of Virginia's Center for National Security Law, said he understands the distinction between leaking classified material and information that is merely private. He also made clear that he is almost always dead-set against leaking. Regardless of who makes or broadcasts the leak, "good people die and freedom is placed in jeopardy," he said. However, Turner added that "it seems clear to me that Russia was trying to influence the outcome of our election, which I view as a serious national security issue." If a disgruntled Democratic National Committee official had copied some documents and leaked them, "I think Trump could have drawn a reasonable distinction between those garden variety disclosures of private information (arguably by ‘whistleblowers’) and disclosures derived from classified national security programs that were apparently disclosed by government employees in violation of their security agreements." However, "because of the Russian role I don't think that distinction holds up," Turner said. "Bottom line, I would call this a flip-flop." Other experts emphasized that a hack -- something Trump was on record supporting and even encouraging during the campaign -- is potentially worse than a leak. "Information from a hack carried out by a foreign power with the intention of influencing or discrediting U.S. elections is much more serious than leaks of classified information intended to inform the public or influence policy," Rubin said. Benjamin H. Friedman, a research fellow in security studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, went even further. "Trump has done something worse than flip-flop," he said. "He’s showed that his stance of leaks depends on whether it helps him. Flip-floppers change their mind; Trump has showed that he doesn’t have a stance on leaks independent from his interests. He’s pretending otherwise now, but it’s not credible." Indeed, there’s an example from Trump’s somewhat more distant past that addressed this issue. On Oct. 30, 2013 -- long before Trump was an announced candidate for president -- he tweeted, "ObamaCare is a disaster and Snowden is a spy who should be executed-but if it and he could reveal Obama's records,I might become a major fan." Trump may have been joking in this tweet. Still, it suggests that this dichotomy -- between leaks that help him and leaks that don’t -- has crossed his mind before. Our ruling During the campaign, Trump praised WikiLeaks, an organization that exists to publicize private, and at times classified, information. Now, as president, he’s criticizing federal officials who have leaked secret or classified information to the news media. Trump has a point that the leaked material from the DNC wasn’t classified. Still, the underlying principle is the same: Trump was praising the release of private information during the campaign but criticizing it after he became president. The situations are substantially similar, but Trump’s sentiments are not.

pomt-06818	"One in every five families in the state of New Jersey has a loved one with a mental illness, a serious mental illness, and today, we don’t care."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/aug/11/richard-codey/sen-codey-says-1-5-new-jersey-families-has-loved-o/	Gov. Chris Christie’s budget veto pen didn’t just hit big-ticket expenditures. Even small amounts – including $50,000 for a mental health awareness group – was trimmed from the state’s spending plan this summer. And state Sen. Richard Codey (D-Essex) had plenty to say about it during a speech he gave July 11 on the Senate floor in Trenton. "One in every five families in the state of New Jersey has a loved one with a mental illness, a serious mental illness, and today, we don’t care," Codey said in response to Christie’s line-item veto of a $50,000 appropriation for the Governor’s Council on Mental Health Stigma. PolitiFact New Jersey checked Codey’s statistic and found that, depending on definition and methodology, the figure is generally accurate. While several national mental health-affiliated organizations cite that statistic for all states, at least one other said the ratio is 1-in-4 families. "These days our fact sheets are using one in four (families) any day in a given year has a mental health problem," said Bob Carolla, spokesman for the National Alliance on Mental Illness. "It depends on who has done the most recent study and parameters around it." Codey, who was governor from November 2004 to January 2006, signed an executive order in November 2004 to create the Governor’s Task Force on Mental Health to investigate the state’s mental health system. One of the task force’s recommendations was creation of the council, with an aim to educate people about mental illness. "The thing about mental health is it knows no barriers, rich or poor, black or white," Codey told us. Codey raised more than one issue in his statement, so we’ll look at the number of people in New Jersey affected by mental illness, explain the budget cut and identify "serious mental illness." First, New Jersey had 3,152,877 households from 2005 to 2009, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. If each household is considered a family, that means approximately 630,575 New Jerseyans had a mental illness during that time, based on Codey’s statistic. Second, state Treasury Department spokesman Bill Quinn confirmed the $50,000 cut and said the money was used for promotional materials and expenses related to council Executive Director Celina Gray’s outreach efforts about mental illness. Quinn said Gray remains employed and the council still exists, but the work connected with it has been folded into the Human Services Department’s Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services. The governor’s office did not respond to two email requests for comment on Codey’s statement. Codey, Carolla and Phil Lubitz, associate director of NAMI’s state office in North Brunswick, each identified serious mental illness as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, major depression and panic disorder. "Loved ones also applies to immediate family members," Lubitz said. Although Codey’s statement was about New Jersey, the 1-in-5 statistic is used by these organizations: the U.S. Surgeon General’s Office; the American Psychiatric Association; and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. "In 2009, there were an estimated 45.1 million people with any mental illness in the past year -- that’s 19.9 percent of all individuals age 12 and older … or, if you prefer, about 1 in every 5 individuals," Bradford Stone, spokesman for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, said in an email. "For serious mental illness, the rate was 4.8 percent (about 1 in every 20 individuals) or 11.0 million individuals for all individuals age 18 and older." NAMI has used 1 in 4 families since 2007, and the National Institute of Mental Health cites both statistics. "The current prevalence estimate is that about 20 percent of the U.S. population are affected by mental disorders during a given year," according to "Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General," issued in 1999 and still one of the main standards today in assessing mental illness, Carolla said. Let’s review. In responding to a budget cut for a council formed by the Governor’s Task Force on Mental Health, Codey said that one in every five New Jersey families has a loved one with a mental illness. Various reports from at least three organizations cite that statistic, but NAMI cites 1-in-4. Another national organization cites both. Even with the slight disparity, the overall point of Codey’s statement is that mental illness is very common. We rate Codey’s claim True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-12240	Says former Rep. Michele Bachmann said that "White People Have Suffered More In The Last 8 Years Than Blacks Did During Couple Years Of Slavery."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/14/uspoln/no-bachmann-didnt-say-whites-suffered-more-under-o/	Some clickbait is harder to kill than a vampire. Recently, as part of Facebook’s efforts to fight fake news, we learned that users had flagged as potentially fabricated a post about a claim purportedly by former Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn. Prior to her retirement after the 2014 midterm elections, Bachmann, a social conservative, was known for making controversial statements. So it may not come as a surprise that, more than two years after her retirement, she’s still being used by clickbait purveyors, banking on the anger of liberal social media users. The article noted by Facebook users, from the site USPOLN.com, is headlined, "Bachmann: ‘White People Have Suffered More In The Last 8 Years Than Blacks Did During Couple Years Of Slavery.’ " Oddly, the words that the headline attributes in quotation marks to Bachmann do not appear in the subsequent article. But the "quotes" provided discuss similar themes. The article quotes Bachmann as saying, "I don’t think all of the suffering of African-Americans during the period of slavery can ever equate to what’s been done to white conservative Americans in the past eight years of Obama’s presidency. Because, let’s face it, during that time, we’ve had the Supreme Court’s decision to legalize same-sex marriage, we’ve had countless terrorist attacks, we’ve had many racial killings and crimes and we’ve had several small-scale revolutions in some of America’s major cities. Is that the legacy President Obama wants to be remembered by? Does he really want to go down in history as the man who created a gap between black people and white people? Judging by his actions during his presidency, I’m guessing he does." Before we go any further, it would be an opportune time to note that USPOLN.com is, as we have noted previously, contains a disclaimer in the "about us" tab that reads, "USPOLN may include information from sources that may or may not be reliable and facts that don’t necessarily exist. These articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney." In other words, not a word of this "story" should be believed. However, this isn’t just fake news. It’s old fake news. (Perhaps the focus on Obama should have been a clue to its timing -- he’s been out of office for six months now.) We found that an essentially identical article appeared as early as Aug. 23, 2016, on the website Newslo, which bills itself as a mix of true and fake news. With the click of a button, you can see what’s real and what’s fake. If you click on the button, the part about Bachmann’s comments on slavery falls into the "fake" category. Moral of the story: Liberal dislike of Bachmann has survived her retirement so strongly that it is able to carry multiple iterations of clickbait. The website USPOLN.com said in a post that Bachmann had said, "White People Have Suffered More In The Last 8 Years Than Blacks Did During Couple Years Of Slavery." Not only is USPOLN.com an acknowledged "satirical" site, but the post originated in August 2016 on another acknowledged purveyor of articles that it admits are partially fake.

Lisa Murkowski and Mark Begich "vote as much as 80 percent of the time together."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/17/mark-begich/do-alaska-senators-mark-begich-and-lisa-murkowski-/	Sen. Mark Begich says he and Sen. Lisa Murkowski are on the same team. But she doesn’t see it that way. Murkowski, a Republican, has said that she hopes Begich, a Democrat, loses his seat to a Republican challenger in November. Both senators currently represent Alaska. Despite Murkowski’s feelings, Begich is touting their teamwork in the Senate in a new radio ad. "Lisa Murkowski and Mark Begich vote as much as 80 percent of the time together — that’s healthy for Alaska. I have a great dislike for partisan politics," the ad says, narrated by a man identified as Skip Nelson, an aviator living in Anchorage. "I think Lisa and Mark are a great team for Alaska. I’d like to keep them there." Murkowski, who is not up for re-election this year, fired back, telling the Alaska Dispatch that the pair agrees on some Alaska-specific issues, but regarding national matters, "There is a real departure between where Mark stands and where I stand." And in a statement sent to PolitiFact, she said, "Over the last five years when we have taken a stand on the role of government in Alaskans' lives I have fundamentally disagreed with Sen. Begich... I believe we need less intervention from government while he pushes for more." The current Republican front-runner hoping to beat Begich is former Alaska Attorney General Dan Sullivan. Begich’s Republican opponents have tried to emphasize Begich’s ties to President Barack Obama and the Democratic Party. Considering this Congress’ penchant for polarization and Murkowski’s response, we thought it would be worthwhile to see if they really had voted together 80 percent of the time. The numbers The Begich campaign calculated the 80 percent figure using every roll call vote in 2014 in which both Murkowski and Begich participated, through July 2. Murkowski and Begich voted 183 times, according to the campaign’s data, which we confirmed. They voted together 148 times, and they disagreed 35 times. Based on these numbers, the senators voted together 80.8 percent of the time for the first six months of 2014. The 35 votes on which Begich and Murkowski disagreed in 2014 were primarily procedural, but the list also includes more than 10 judges’ and administrators’ confirmations that Murkowski opposed. However, the pair has served together since 2009, so this is just a slice of their voting records. Since the start of 2009, Begich and Murkowski have voted together 60 percent of the time, according to a comparison report by Congressional Quarterly, a nonpartisan outlet for congressional news and legislative tracking. Although the 80 percent statistic inflates their overall record of voting together, they do have a history of voting together that rivals other Senate pairs from opposing parties. In the current Congress (starting in 2013), 16 states have one Democratic senator and one Republican senator. Of these 16 pairs, Begich and Murkowski voted together the most, at a rate of 65 percent in the current Congress, according to OpenCongress’ head-to-head comparison tool. The pair with the next-highest rate of voting together is 47 percent, belonging to New Hampshire’s Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat, and Kelly Ayotte, Republican. OpenCongress’ data also showed that Murkowski is more likely than Begich to deviate from her party. She voted with Republicans 65 percent of the time in the current Congress, while Begich voted with Democrats 91 percent of the time. One other point: National Journal ranked Begich as the 48th most liberal and 52nd most conservative senator in 2013, based on roll call votes from that year. The magazine ranked Murkowski as 56th most liberal and 44th most conservative, showing that they are both moderate voters. How significant are these votes? In her retort, Murkowski said the votes from this year -- on which the Begich campaign based the 80 percent figure -- were largely procedural, and that’s correct. She said the two senators have differed on important votes throughout the six years they have served together. Here are a few votes with national significance since 2009 and whether or not they voted together: December 2009, On passage of the Affordable Care Act: Disagree (Begich voted "yes," Murkowski "no"); July 2010, On passage of the Dodd-Frank financial regulation bill: Disagree (Begich "yes," Murkowski "no"); April 2011, In favor of stopping the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating greenhouse gas emissions: Disagree (Begich "no," Murkowski "yes"); March 2013, In favor of constructing the Keystone XL pipeline: Agree (both "yes"); June 2013, On passage of the Senate immigration reform bill: Agree (both "yes"); October 2013, On passage of the budget bill ending the government shutdown: Agree (both "yes"); Jan. 30, 2014, On delaying the increase of flood insurance premium: Agree (both "yes"); July 16, 2014, Failed motion to consider a bill to reverse the Supreme Court’s Hobby Lobby decision: Agree (both "yes"). Our ruling A Begich campaign radio ad said, "Lisa Murkowski and Mark Begich vote as much as 80 percent of the time together." We found they had voted together 80 percent of the time. However, this statistic is based on the last six months, and Begich has served with Murkowski since 2009. The pair does, though, have a history of voting together more often than not -- about 60 percent of all votes since 2009 -- and the ad said "as much as 80 percent." We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-00576	47 percent of Americans "can’t pay for an unexpected $400 expense through savings or credit cards, without selling something or borrowing money."	true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jun/09/hunter-schwarz/47-say-they-lack-ready-cash-pay-surprise-400-bill/	The economic struggles of ordinary Americans are getting a good airing this presidential season and a statistical finding from the Federal Reserve provides ammunition for a candidate in either party who wants to make the case that too many people have been left behind. Washington Post reporter Hunter Schwarz plugged some Fed data into a little segment called "By the numbers", in the newspaper’s June 8, 2015, edition: "47: The percentage of Americans who can’t pay for an unexpected $400 expense through savings or credit cards, without selling something or borrowing money, according to the Federal Reserve." The dollar figure caught our eye. It seemed surprisingly low. Other researchers have tried to gauge the financial vulnerability of American households to an economic setback, but typically, the amounts they test are much higher, in the thousands of dollars. We thought we’d take a closer look. The Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking A few years ago, the Federal Reserve Board began asking Americans how well they’re doing financially. In May, the Fed released the 2014 results. The questions ranged from retirement planning, to how people managed any student debt they might have, to whether they think their overall situation is headed up or down. To measure participants’ sense of financial vulnerability, the survey asked them to imagine they had an emergency expense that cost $400, and it asked them how they would cover it. The better-off group said they would use cash-on-hand or a credit card that they would pay off in a month. Others said they would use a credit card but take time to pay it off, or they might borrow from a family member or a pay-day loan company, or they might sell something. And some said there was no way they could cover an unexpected $400 expense. Across the more than 5,800 people who completed the online survey, 53 percent said they would be able to pay essentially immediately. That left 47 percent who said they could not. "Specifically, respondents indicate that they simply could not cover the expense (14 percent); would sell something (10 percent); or would rely on one or more means of borrowing to pay for at least part of the expense, including paying with a credit card that they pay off over time (18 percent), borrowing from friends or family (13 percent), or using a payday loan (2 percent)," the report said. Interestingly, making over $100,000 a year was no guarantee of security. About a quarter of the more affluent group said that at the very least, they would pay off the $400 over time. As this chart from the report shows, ethnicity and income strongly affected the ability to absorb a $400 outlay. Other studies George Washington University business professor Annamaria Lusardi and two colleagues (Daniel J. Schneider at Princeton University and Peter Tufano at Oxford University) conducted a similar survey in the depths of the recession in 2009. Their study asked people how they would handle a sudden $2,000 bill that they had to pay in 30 days. About half the respondents said they would probably or certainly be unable to cope with such an emergency out of their own funds. Lusardi said she considers the results comparable. "The Federal Reserve had a lower amount, but it had to be paid right away," she told PunditFact. "We gave people more time, so I think the percentages are consistent." In fact, even with five years separating the surveys, it is the similarity in the responses that caught her eye. Lusardi said it is a sign of the recession’s deep damage to the typical American’s balance sheet. "Until recently, the labor market and wages have been stagnant," Lusardi said. "In the recession, many families used up their reserves of liquidity. It takes a long time to reestablish a good financial situation." There are other indications that most Americans live with a limited financial cushion. When the government shutdown for two weeks in 2013, a University of Michigan research team tracked a hefty drop in household spending among government workers. Even though their paychecks were interrupted only a short time, households cut their outlays in half, and many delayed paying their mortgages and credit card bills. Some racked up high cost credit card debt that took them up to nine months to pay back. Lusardi’s 2009 research included a number of other western nations. For the record, the United States ranked sixth out of eight in residents saying they would certainly or probably be able to manage a sudden $2,000 bill. Rank/Country Percent able to cope Rank/Country Percent able to cope 1. Italy 80.1 5. Portugal 54.1 2. Netherlands 73.2 6. United States 50 3. Canada 71.7 7. Germany 49.4 4. France 62.8 8. United Kingdom 47.8 Our ruling Schwarz said 47 percent of Americans can’t pay for an unexpected $400 expense through savings or credit cards, without selling something or borrowing money. The only caveat here, and it’s a very minor one, is that figure represents the number of people who say they can’t make that payment, based on a Federal Reserve Board survey. The Federal Reserve Board results are in line with a similar study and related research. We rate the claim True.	None	Hunter Schwarz	None	None	None	2015-06-09T12:05:48	2015-06-08	['United_States']
pomt-04900	"An April study found that about 70 percent of ads in this election cycle have been negative [due to SuperPACs], up from only 9 percent through the same period in 2008."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/aug/05/sheldon-whitehouse/sen-sheldon-whitehouse-ri-says-growth-superpacs-le/	Negative campaign ads: most people say they hate them, but studies show that many people are swayed by them. Thus, major races can get pretty nasty, and there's a fear that the presidential contest this year will break all records for nastiness, thanks to the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision. The court upheld the right of persons, organizations and corporations to spend as much as they would like on political advertising -- while hiding their involvement -- through the use of organizations known as super political action committees (Super-PACs). To shed some light on who is behind such attack ads, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-RI, has been promoting the DISCLOSE Act. The name is an acronym for Democracy Is Strengthened by Casting Light on Spending in Elections. "When you don't have accountability, there's no limit to the things that people will say," Whitehouse said during a debate on the floor of the Senate. "One of the restraints on the vitriol and the filth that so often is part of the American political debate is that candidates have to stand by their ads. "And if you say something that is awful, if you engage in relentless negative attacks, voters may charge you a price for that," Whitehouse said. "Well, that of course disappears when the name behind the ad is attached to no living person or corporation. It's just an entity, it's a sham, it's a phony, it's a shell." The DISCLOSE act would require some tax-exempt groups that engage in political advertising to reveal individual donors who gave $10,000 or more. Critics say the act discriminates because it wouldn't apply to unions. They also say disclosure might open donors up to intimidation and ridicule, inhibiting free speech. During an unsuccessful push to bring the proposal to a vote in the Senate -- a drive blocked twice by Republicans, on July 16 and 17 -- Whitehouse said the Citizens United decision was already sparking a giant increase in negative political advertising. "An April study found that about 70 percent of ads in this election cycle have been negative, up from only 9 percent through the same period in 2008," he said. That's a big jump in negative advertising. We wondered if it were true. The context When we contacted Whitehouse's office, spokesman Seth Larson sent us to a study released May 2, 2012, by the Wesleyan Media Project at Wesleyan University. It defined a negative advertisement as an ad in which the candidate's opponent is mentioned. The study looked only at TV ads in the presidential races and only ads broadcast from January 1 through April 22 of 2008 and the same period in 2012. It turns out that Whitehouse quoted the study accurately. The researchers said that 70.0 percent of all ads in 2012 were negative during that period, compared with 9.1 percent in 2008. But Whitehouse also said that the Citizens United decision is responsible for that increase in negative ads, so let’s look at that aspect. The political scientists we spoke with said the Supreme Court decision is having a huge effect on the tone and rhythm of the 2012 campaign. The Wesleyan study suggests that the effect was already clear in the first four months of this year. Consider the ads purchased by special-interest groups or SuperPACs. Of the 10,062 special-interest group ads aired during the first quarter of 2008, 75 percent were rated positive and 25 percent were rated negative. By 2012, the number of special-interest ads had exploded, jumping more than 12-fold to 123,062. In addition, the mix of ads had reversed, with only 14 percent positive and 86 percent negative. Meanwhile, the number of ads bought by candidates themselves plummeted, from 289,622 in the first quarter of 2008 to 74,267 this year, an indication that they were letting the special interest ads carry the ball for promoting their candidacies. As Michael Franz, co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project, said in the report, "That's a lot of money and airtime backed by undisclosed sources." Other factors affect rate But Franz and the other experts we consulted cautioned that additional factors are also at work. The first four months of the 2008 race were very different from the same period in the 2012 contest. In early 2008, "one reason the number was so low was because the [Barack] Obama and [Hillary] Clinton campaigns didn't really attack each other on TV that much," said Franz, now at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine. "They did off the air, and they were obviously quite ruthless. But in the ads themselves, there wasn't a lot of sniping back and forth against each other. They promoted themselves primarily. "That changed for Obama in the general election," Franz said. "He was a very negative candidate and once the general election started, it became an overwhelmingly negative campaign, as it usually is in the general election." During the first four months of 2012, SuperPACs drove up the percentage of negative ads, he said, "but also candidates have been overwhelmingly negative against each other in the [2012] Republican primary." So let's look at the types of ads placed by the candidates themselves. In 2008, only 9 percent of the ads placed by all the candidates in the first four months of the year were negative. By 2012 that number had grown to nearly 53 percent. The first four months of a presidential election year are not necessarily the best guide to the rhythm of the rest of a presidential campaign. "I really don't think they're indicative of what's to come," said Mary Ellen Balchunis, a political scientist at LaSalle University in Philadelphia. "It's how close the polls are, it's whether your opponent is going negative, it's whether you are responding." Early in the contest, "the ads are generally more about who the candidate is and what the candidate would do. That's particularly true for a challenger," said Stephen Farnsworth of the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Va., a key swing state. "There are always some negative ads, but they are really sprinkled in the mix. In the fall, when people are really turning their attention to the election, that's when the number of negative ads escalates." "In this election cycle, things are already so negative, it's hard to imagine that there's much room for them to get more negative between now and November," said Farnsworth, author of "Spinner-in-Chief: How Presidents Sell Their Policies and Themselves." Our ruling Sheldon Whitehouse said, "An April study found that about 70 percent of ads in this election cycle have been negative, up from only 9 percent through the same period in 2008." He is correctly quoting the study, but the context of his comment makes it clear that he blames the SuperPACs, which were freed up by the Citizens United decision. Those special-interest groups are certainly playing a much larger role this year, in part because they have become the major source of TV ad purchases. But the data also reveal that the candidates are being far more negative earlier in the campaign than they were four years ago, and that also drove up the percentage of negative ads in the beginning of 2012. Because his statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate the claim as Mostly True. (Get updates from PolitiFact Rhode Island on Twitter: @politifactri.

pomt-08395	"In Rhode Island, there were thousands of jobs that were created" by the federal stimulus program	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/oct/23/james-langevin/langevin-says-stimulus-program-created-thousands-j/	Update: On Oct. 21, 2010, we rated as Barely True a statement by U.S. Rep. James R. Langevin that the federal stimulus program created thousands of jobs in Rhode Island. We have discovered that we misread a chart at recovery.gov that showed the number of stimulus jobs created in Rhode Island. This is a revised story that clarifies the number but does not change the ruling. With the national and state economies both sagging, the effectiveness of the federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, better known as the stimulus bill, has been a focus of debate in this year’s congressional elections. During a debate with Republican Mark Zaccaria on Oct. 14 on WLNE-TV, sponsored by the League of Women Voters, Langevin, a strong supporter of the stimulus program, said it had "created thousands of jobs here." Debating Zaccaria two days later on the WPRI "Newsmakers" program, Langevin said: "In Rhode Island, there were thousands of jobs that were created" by the stimulus program. We wondered: Has the stimulus program created thousands of Rhode Island jobs? Trying to determine the employment effect of a specific government program can be difficult, but the Recovery Act included specific provisions that required the government to post online information detailing how much money was spent, where it was spent and on what. Included in that is the number of work hours paid for with stimulus money, expressed as the equivalent of a 40-hour-a-week worker. The current Rhode Island number, posted at Recovery. gov, the federal website with the stimulus spending data, is 1,989.58. But that’s for the three-month period from April 1 to June 30, 2010, not, as we initially reported, for the duration of the stimulus program, which started in February 2009. So what’s the real number of new Rhode Island jobs created by the stimulus since February 2009? Laurie Petrone of the state Office of Recovery and Reinvestment, the official who tracks stimulus aid here, said it’s impossible to say. When the program began, Petrone said, the federal government asked participating state agencies and employers to keep count of new jobs created by the stimulus. The first reporting period was for Feb. 17 to Sept. 30, 2009. Contractors and agencies were to report the number of full-time and part-time work hours that stimulus money paid for. Those hours were then added up and the total converted into full-time workers. For those first eight months, Petrone said the statewide jobs number for participating public and private sector employers was 1,960.82. For the next period, Oct. 1, 2009 to the end of 2009, it was 1,900.86. The reported figure for Jan. 1, 2010 to March 31, 2010, dropped to 530 because many Rhode Island agencies and contractors weren’t able to file timely reports due to the late-March flooding in the state, Petrone said. Then there’s the 1,989.58 figure for the April 1, to June 30, 2010 period, which is the one on the Recovery,gov website now. Because many stimulus programs are reaching the end of their funding, the quarterly job numbers may start to go down, she said. Petrone said it’s hard to determine how many new jobs were created and how many preserved because there was no clear definition of what represented a new job. At the beginning of the program, she said, any work that was paid for in the first eight months was counted in the total. If the job carried over into the next quarter, it was counted as a stimulus job then as well. But that means you can’t get a cumulative picture by adding the quarterly reports together, she said, because you would wind up counting carried-over workers twice. Each quarterly report has to be looked at as a "discrete snapshot" by itself. Petrone said that means there is no way to know how many of the 1,900.86 jobs in the second reporting period from Oct 1-Dec. 31, 2009 included workers who would have been laid off but were not, new workers who would not have been hired without the stimulus money, or workers whose existing jobs carried over from the previous period. The same applies to the next two reporting periods. There were other problems. Petrone said states and contractors were confused over how to classify new and retained jobs. She gave the example of a state agency that got a stimulus grant and used it for a specific project that added hours to an existing part time worker’s duties. "Is that a new job, or a saved job, or a retained job?" Petrone asked. The guidelines were unclear. In December 2009, in response to confusion and complaints about the reporting process, federal Office of Management and Budget Director Peter R. Orszag told reporting entities to avoid any "subjective judgment on whether jobs were created or retained" and just report hours worked, in the equivalent of full-time jobs, that were financed by Recovery Act funds. Langevin spokeswoman Joy Fox said the Recovery.gov figures show only part of the program’s effects. It doesn’t count the effect of tax cuts and secondary hiring caused by the increased economic activity the stimulus generated. She pointed to a July 14 analysis by the president’s Council of Economic advisers, which estimated that, overall, the stimulus program has created or saved 11,000 jobs in Rhode Island. The council’s report used a broader definition than Langevin did, including jobs saved, not just created. The council reached its 11,000 figure by estimating that 3.04 million jobs were saved or created nationally by the Recover Act. It then extrapolated jobs numbers for each state. The council defends its methodology but cautions that the state numbers are "inherently more speculative and uncertain." We can’t determine exactly how many stimulus jobs were created in Rhode Island. Even Petrone, the state official keeping tabs on stimulus spending, can’t determine that. Nor can Langevin. The highest quarterly report shows 1,989.58 jobs actually created. It’s close enough to 2,000 to be literally true, but, in our opinion, less than "thousands" would imply. For those reasons, we rate his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05295	"Right now, we have the lowest gas tax of anywhere in the country."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/may/22/colleen-kiernan/does-georgia-have-lowest-gas-taxes-country/	The Georgia Sierra Club surprised many when it recently announced it is against this summer’s voter referendum for a penny-per-dollar sales tax to pay for 157 projects aimed at easing traffic congestion in the Atlanta region. The grass-roots environmental organization believes the current project list needs more ways to get Georgians away from their cars. (Just over half of the regional $6.14 billion list would go to mass transit projects, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has reported.) Director Colleen Kiernan suggested in a radio interview that the state could fund more mass transit projects by using money from Georgia’s gas tax. She said the tax, which helps fund area road and bridge work, has contributed to metro Atlanta’s asphalt-focused development patterns. Kiernan then made a claim about the gas tax that had PolitiFact Georgia ready to take a road trip in a search for the truth. "Right now, we have the lowest gas tax of anywhere in the country," Kiernan told WABE-FM’s Denis O’Hayer. Kiernan thought she said Georgia has one of the lowest gas taxes in the nation. She argued she should still get high marks from the Truth-O-Meter. "It should definitely be on the green side," she said, arguing for a Mostly True rating. Kiernan sent us a report by University of Georgia researchers on whether the state’s motor use fuel tax collects enough revenue. The state’s Transportation Department asked UGA to do the research. The motor use fuel tax in most states is an excise tax, but several states impose an excise tax, as well as a sales tax that is applied to the sale price of gasoline. Georgia’s excise tax is currently 7.5 cents a gallon. (Excise taxes are special taxes on the purchase of items such as gasoline, alcoholic beverages and tobacco products. Excise taxes are usually fixed amounts per item, rather than percentages of the price.) Georgia adds a 3 percent tax on sales of motor fuel that is classified as motor use fuel tax and a 1 percent tax that is received as general fund revenue. In 2008, the excise tax and both sales taxes combined produced an effective rate of 21.2 cents per gallon, the UGA report noted. About 17.8 cents per gallon is classified as motor use fuel tax, UGA said. The UGA report, which came out in December 2010, said Georgia has one of the lowest excise taxes around, but Georgia is higher than most of its Southern neighbors if you include the sales taxes. Kiernan also forwarded us a link to a February 2010 report by the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization that does research on state and federal tax policy. The report showed Georgia’s gas tax per gallon was 12.4 cents, which was the second lowest in the nation. Alaska was the lowest at 8 cents per gallon. "Alaska is a different situation ... because they get so much of the revenue from oil and gas leasing," Kiernan said. PolitiFact Georgia also looked at a January 2012 Tax Foundation state-by-state breakdown of state tax and other gas taxes and fees. Georgia’s excise tax was the second lowest (only Florida was lower). Other taxes and fees pushed the Peach State into the upper half of states with the 18th highest gas taxes at 29.4 cents per gallon. But those other fees and taxes include various county gas taxes. Kiernan was talking about state taxes. An April 2012 breakdown by the American Petroleum Institute had the same numbers for most states, including Georgia, as the January Tax Foundation report. The breakdown has a column that includes federal taxes, which are 18.4 cents per gallon in every state. Kiernan erred a bit in what she meant to say on a radio show with a large audience. Her larger point is supported by several charts that show Georgia has one of the lowest excise gas taxes in the nation. Her statement could have been more precise. Still, under our rating system, she gets a Mostly True.	None	Colleen Kiernan	None	None	None	2012-05-22T06:00:00	2012-05-14	['None']
pomt-06896	Says Tim Pawlenty said in 2006, "The era of small government is over... the government has to be more proactive and more aggressive."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/26/michele-bachmann/did-tim-pawlenty-say-era-small-government-over/	What happened to Minnesota nice? Michele Bachmann blasted her fellow Minnesotan Tim Pawlenty after he questioned her experience. The two are competing for the Republican nomination for president. "These are serious times that require serious solutions -- not more of the same. Being right on the issues is critical -- it is what the American people demand. Executive experience is not an asset if it simply means bigger and more intrusive government," Bachmann said in a prepared statement on July 24, 2011. "Governor Pawlenty said in 2006, 'The era of small government is over... the government has to be more proactive and more aggressive.' That's the same philosophy that, under President Obama, has brought us record deficits, massive unemployment and an unconstitutional health care plan." We wanted to see if Bachmann was correct about what Pawlenty said about small government, as it seems like a sentiment unlikely to be popular in a Republican primary. We contacted both campaigns for comment but didn't hear back from either one. We were able to easily find the comment; it originated with an August 2006 report in the Minneapolis Star Tribune. (We found it in the Nexis newspaper database.) "Pawlenty sees his role as reformer," says the headline. "The GOP governor has targeted what he calls excessive corporate power. Critics call his election-year 'populism' cosmetic." The story says that starting in 2006, Pawlenty "repeatedly made himself a nuisance to major industries that frequently back Republicans," particularly calling on Congress to put new regulations on prescription drug companies and auto makers. The story said he called for a two-year ban on advertising prescription drugs, urged regulators to speed the release of generic insulin products and proposed new regulations to support the use of ethanol. "Those kinds of proposals for government intervention in the free market on the surface might seem unusual coming from a conservative GOP politician. But they are illustrations of the way that Pawlenty, a fiscal and social conservative, also styles himself a kind of latter-day trust buster, a reformer who is unafraid to challenge big business and wield government power to correct imbalances in the marketplace," the story said. And here's the key section: "The era of small government is over," Pawlenty said in an interview with the Star Tribune. "I'm a market person, but there are certain circumstances where you've got to have government put up the guardrails or bust up entrenched interests before they become too powerful ... Government has to be more proactive, more aggressive." ... Pawlenty insists his own populist streak is no election-year attempt to steer toward the middle. Peel back the conservative, he said, and you find the boy who grew up near South St. Paul's stockyards and learned what happened when power became too concentrated. When companies gain too much power, he said, they can suppress wages. Drug companies can command high prices for brand-name products long after they could have gone generic. Oil companies can use their muscle to keep out renewable fuels. HMOs can shift costs from their members to the public at large. While he may not fit the DFL [Democratic-Farm-Labor Party] definition of a populist, Pawlenty said, "it's a matter of where you draw the line. ... I know that concentrated power unchecked leads to bad things," he said. We're not sure what Pawlenty's own reaction to the story was, but his press secretary didn't like it. The next day, the Star Tribune ran a "clarification," that said the story "quoted Gov. Tim Pawlenty saying 'The era of small government is over,' a comment he made in reference to a point made in a 2004 column by New York Times columnist David Brooks. Pawlenty spokesman Brian McClung said Monday that Pawlenty's record shows he is not a supporter of 'big government' and that he was 'simply talking about the need for government to be more effective and active.'" The Star Tribune story doesn't mention David Brooks, but we went searching for the relevant story, and it seems likely it was a story Brooks wrote for the New York Times Magazine that took the measure of the conservative movement in 2004, headlined "How to re-invent the G.O.P." In the story, Brooks noted that historical forces like Islamic extremism and the end of socialism were changing the nature of conservatism, pushing it away from a minimalist vision for government. The new conservatism "understands the paradox that if you don't have a positive vision of government, you won't be able to limit the growth of government. If you can't offer people a vision of what government should do, you won't be able to persuade them about the things it shouldn't do. If the Republican Party is going to evolve into a principled majority party, members of this group are going to have to build a governing philosophy based on this insight," Brooks wrote. Brooks said George W. Bush typified this new approach. "By the time he began his campaign for president in 1999, Bush understood that the simple government-is-the-problem philosophy of the older Republicans was obsolete. During that campaign, Bush criticized what he called the 'destructive mind-set: the idea that if government would only get out of our way, all our problems would be solved. An approach with no higher goal, no nobler purpose, than "Leave us alone.''' Instead, Bush argued, 'government must be carefully limited but strong and active.'" Pawlenty maintains that he was incorrectly quoted in the Star Tribune story. In May 2011, he went on Rush Limbaugh's radio show, and Limbaugh asked him if he had indeed said, "The era of small government is over." "The other side has pushed that falsely for a number of years," Pawleny said, according to the show's transcript. "What happened is in the Minnesota Star Tribune -- not exactly a conservative publication -- I made reference to an article that David Brooks wrote which was entitled, 'The Era of Small Government is Over.' I didn't say those words myself; I was referencing his article. "The very next day, the Star Tribune, after a big battle, printed a clarification or a correction in their correction page," he continued. "Of course, the main article was on page one and the correction was buried in some footnote in page three, but that incorrect quote has haunted me -- and I'm glad I had a chance in this big national forum on your great show to clarify, because if you go to the next day's newspaper you'll see the clarification in the Star Tribune." We should note that the headline of the Brooks' article we found was not "The Era of Small Government is Over," but we won't quibble about that. Pawlenty could have seen the article or another one like it somewhere with a modified headline, and the phrase certainly captures the article's sentiment. We also contacted the Star Tribune to see if it still stood by the story. The story's author, Patricia Lopez, is now the newspaper's political editor. Here's what she said: "The governor was quoted correctly, which is why we printed only a clarification. He was quoting a David Brooks column, but as you can see, it was in support of other statements he made about the role of government. He never asked to have any other statement in the article corrected." But even if Pawlenty was quoting Brooks when he said the phrase "the era of small government is over" during the interview, he seemed to be doing so approvingly. The rest of the article portrays Pawlenty as someone who was willing to use government to intervene in the markets and gives examples to support that. Here's a little more from the story. "Oil companies have played a role in suppressing the development of alternative fuels," Pawlenty said, with heavy-handed contracts that prevent gasoline stations from providing pumps for renewable fuels such as ethanol. With the nation's economic security at stake, "that is disproportionate power," he said. "Government has to step in." Similarly, when he testified before Congress for reimportation of drugs from Canada, where prices are government-regulated, Pawlenty said he got a taste of the pharmaceutical industry's might. "I've seen it firsthand," he said. "They've got a power that would frighten most citizens." Pawlenty has changed positions on energy policy; he once supported a cap and trade system but no longer does. We looked for any recent statements he's made about reimporting drugs from Canada, but couldn't find any. We also asked two political watchers in Minnesota if the Star Tribune story was generally reflective of Pawlenty's political views in 2006. They said it was. "In terms of his views on government, I think he can best be described as actively wanting to use the government to achieve certain ends, only with less taxes," said David Schultz, a professor at Hamline University who studies Minnesota politics. Schultz said Pawlenty's rhetoric became more conservative starting around 2008, when his name was mentioned as a potential running mate for John McCain. "In fairness, Pawlenty did restrain spending by the Democratic Legislature. But he was more moderate on several other issues than he now appears, and the (Star Tribune story) is an example of that," said Steve Schier, a professor of political science at Carleton College. So where does this leave us? Back in 2006, Pawlenty was portraying himself as a conservative who was willing to intervene in markets, and he said that government has to "bust up entrenched interests before they become too powerful." It appears he's been backing off those positions in 2011, but that doesn't change what his views were years ago. If he was quoting David Brooks when he said "the era of small government is over," he seemed to be doing so approvingly, though a spokesman said he did not mean to imply that he supported "big government."

pomt-00854	The state of Florida has seen "double-digit drops" in alcohol use among teens.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/mar/18/susan-pitman/teen-alcohol-abuse-has-dropped-double-digits-advoc/	As the Legislature considers changing rules for Florida’s burgeoning craft beer industry, one advocacy group is saying it’s important to maintain the state’s downward trend in teen alcohol abuse. During debate at the Senate commerce and tourism committee about whether to let breweries sell 64-ounce growlers, Susan Pitman, a board member for a collection of drug abuse prevention groups called the Florida Coalition Alliance, urged lawmakers to consider limiting pour sizes in beer-tasting rooms. Pitman said that preventing alcohol abuse demands regulation of these tasting rooms. "While the country as a whole has seen a decline in youth drinking, the state of Florida is a leader, with double-digit drops in 30-day teen alcohol use," she said. Pitman’s arguments may have had some impact; sponsor Sen. Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, agreed to revisit his bill. But in the meantime, we wondered: Has the declining drinking rate of Florida’s minors really dropped as much as Pitman said? (We considered checking whether Florida’s decline made it a "leader" among states, but we backed off after we learned that the state and national numbers -- which also are on the decline -- aren’t precisely comparable.) Pitman, who also serves as executive director of Jacksonville-based Drug Free Duval, told PolitiFact Florida that she got her talking point from the Florida Youth Substance Abuse Survey. That’s an annual questionnaire given to middle and high school students in order to collect data about risky behaviors, such as smoking and drug use. The survey is coordinated by the state departments of Children and Families, Education, Health, Juvenile Justice and the Governor's Office of Drug Control. The 2014 report is drawn from answers from almost 70,000 Florida students from all 67 counties. There are several questions measuring alcohol use, including binge drinking and whether kids have ever tried alcohol. But in the category Pitman cites -- the percentage of children who had used alcohol during the past 30 days -- the data show a distinct decrease over the last decade. Grade 2004 2014 Decline, 2004-2014 Middle schoolers 20.3 percent 10.1 percent 10.2 points High schoolers 42.0 percent 28.4 percent 13.6 points That’s a double-digit drop for both categories, providing strong evidence for Pitman’s claim. The only caveat is that there’s a different data set that leads to slightly different results. Every two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention undertakes a survey for the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System. It’s conducted every odd-numbered year during the spring semester for grades 9-12 and for middle schoolers. The 2013 data was culled from more than 13,000 forms filled out in schools across the United States. The CDC survey doesn’t offer 30-day alcohol data for middle schoolers, but it does for high schoolers. For Florida, the survey found that between 2003 and 2013, alcohol use by high schoolers during the previous 30 days dropped from 42.7 percent to 34.8 percent. That’s a decline of a little under 8 percentage points -- a bit shy of a double-digit drop. Our ruling Pitman said Florida has seen "double-digit drops" in alcohol use among teens. A survey conducted by the state does show double-digit drops for both middle- and high-schoolers over the last decade, though the decline for high schoolers in a survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found a decline of about 8 percentage points. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Susan Pitman	None	None	None	2015-03-18T14:01:39	2015-03-16	['None']
pomt-08807	"In 1935, more than 50% of the elderly population lived in poverty. Today that poverty rate stands officially at 9.4%."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/17/eddie-bernice-johnson/texas-congresswoman-eddie-bernice-johnson-says-soc/	Aug. 14, 2010, marked the 75th anniversary of the signing of the Social Security Act, and in the run-up to that landmark anniversary, U.S. Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Texas, praised the program in a speech on the House floor. "On the third anniversary of the Social Security Act, President Roosevelt said, 'We have come a long way. But we still have a long way to go. There is still today a frontier that remains unconquered — an America unclaimed. This is the great, the nationwide frontier of insecurity, of human want and fear. This is the frontier — the America — we have set ourselves to reclaim.' Today, much of that dream has been realized. While we may never completely eradicate poverty, great strides have been made. In 1935, more than 50% of the elderly population lived in poverty. Today that poverty rate stands officially at 9.4%," she said on Aug. 10, 2010. We don't have the expertise to judge the effectiveness of social safety net programs, but we did want to check Johnson's claim that "in 1935, more than 50% of the elderly population lived in poverty. Today that poverty rate stands officially at 9.4%." We began with the latter statistic. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, which has been collecting official poverty data for the past several decades, the poverty rate for individuals 65 and older in 2008 -- the latest year for which data are available -- was 9.7 percent. That's pretty close to the figure that Johnson cited. The second number was a bit harder to verify. The U.S. Census Bureau did not begin tracking the poverty rate until 1959. On top of that, data for individuals aged 65 and older are not available for the years 1960 through 1965. We spoke with Deborah Johnson, a senior editor and writer at the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Johnson told us to check out a 1987 study from Eugene Smolensky, Sheldon Danziger, and Peter Gottschalk. The three researchers used data from the 1940 and 1950 Censuses to extend the poverty line back to 1939. How did things look back then? Among men 64 and older, the poverty rate in 1939 was 78 percent. For women, it was 77.5 percent. But what about 1935? "Even ... 78% would probably be a slightly conservative estimate since poverty for all persons in 1939 was considerably lower in 1939 than in 1935," Smolensky wrote us in an e-mail. He said that by his estimates, in 1935, the poverty rate for all families was 69.4 percent. For the elderly, it could have been up to 20 percent higher. Still, the paper also notes that due to changes in the survey methodology, "data presented here for 1939 are not directly comparable to the data for later years." We also looked at research from Robert Plotnick, professor of public affairs at University of Washington. Plotnick and his colleagues (including Smolensky) extended the poverty threshold, adjusting for inflation, back to 1914. In 1935, the poverty rate for the entire U.S. population was 64.9 percent. Plotnick told us that he does not have a breakdown by age, but "since poverty among elders was consistently higher than for the overall population until the mid 1970s, it would be reasonable to assume poverty among the elders in 1935 was at least 50 percent." We asked Johnson's office for a source for the claim and were told that it comes from material that references Growing Old in America, a 1978 publication by David Fischer, now a history professor at Brandeis University. Page 226 contains the statistic that Johnson may have been talking about: "Dependent poverty among the old grew inexorably, from 23 percent in 1910 to 40 percent in 1930, and 50 percent in 1935." The term "dependent poverty" puzzled us, and we tried to reach Fischer to clarify what he meant by that, but he did not respond to our query. Plotnick said it is not a standard term currently used in academic literature. After some research, we did find an instance of the term in the writings of Thomas Malthus, the 19th Century English economist known for the Malthusian theory that population, left unchecked, outstrips food supplies and leads to disaster. Malthus used "dependent poverty'' to describe someone who depends upon charity for survival. That may be similar to what Johnson was talking about, but it is not the same concept. During her speech, she specifically referenced the U.S. "poverty rate," which is a formal term from the U.S. Census. We talked to some of the top researchers in this field, and they all agreed: the best estimates show that the elderly poverty rate in 1935 was probably somewhere in the range of 70 to 90 percent. So, to review, Johnson said that "in 1935, more than 50% of the elderly population lived in poverty. Today that poverty rate stands officially at 9.4%." We found no official statistics for the rate of elderly poverty for the year 1935, only academic projections, and making apples-to-apples comparisons between eras is difficult. But those estimates indicate that Johnson may have seriously underestimated the level of poverty for older Americans amid the Great Depression. Still, Johnson's underlying point stands. The poverty rate among the elderly has dramatically declined. Whether that was the result of Social Security or other factors is beyond the scope of this review. By the best available measures the rate in 1935 was, as she stated, more than 50 percent. And she was just a fraction off on the current level of 9.7 percent. So we rate her statement True.

pomt-09571	"Here in Virginia, we have the opportunity to become the first state on the East Coast to explore for and produce oil and natural gas offshore."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/28/bob-mcdonnell/mcdonnell-says-virginia-first-line-atlantic-oil-dr/	In the Republican response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union speech, newly elected Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell said his state had the chance to be the first on the Atlantic coast to drill offshore for oil and natural gas. "Advances in technology can unleash more natural gas, nuclear, wind, coal, alternative energy that will lower your utility bills," McDonnell said Jan. 27, 2010, from the floor of Virginia's House of Delegates. "Here in Virginia, we have the opportunity to become the first state on the East Coast to explore for and produce oil and natural gas offshore." If drilling happens in the Atlantic, is Virginia first in line? Drilling in the Atlantic -- like in the eastern Gulf of Mexico -- has been taboo until recently. The Minerals Management Service, an arm of the U.S. Department of the Interior, has not held a lease sale for oil or natural gas drilling in the Atlantic since 1983. No leases remain active. The MMS, however, included 2.9 million acres off the shores of Virginia as part of its 2007-2012 gas and oil leasing program. But exploration was prohibited by both executive order and a congressional moratorium. That changed in the summer of 2008. President George W. Bush lifted the executive order banning drilling, then Congress allowed the moratorium to expire. In November of that year, the MMS initiated what it called a "multiyear" leasing process for the rights to drill off Virginia's coast. The area potentially open to drilling would start 50 miles offshore and sits north of the opening of the Chesapeake Bay, closest to Virginia's Eastern Shore counties on the Delmarva Peninsula. The MMS says the area may contain 130 million barrels of oil and 1.14 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. It's the only area in the Atlantic under consideration. Why is McDonnell bringing this up? He believes the Obama administration has done little to move the lease sale ahead. The MMS says it won't happen before 2011. In a letter to Interior Secretary Ken Salazar on Dec. 23, 2009, McDonnell pressed for prompt action, saying drilling could create 2,578 new jobs over 10 years and $271 million in state and local taxes. Those figures, which McDonnell says were based on a 2005 report by the former president of Old Dominion University, subsequently have been questioned. But that's not what we're checking. McDonnell said Virginia was ready to "be the first state on the East Coast to explore for and produce oil and natural gas offshore." Indeed, the nearly 3 million acres off the coast of Virginia is the only area in the Atlantic in the federal government's current five-year oil and gas leasing program. It also is the only area currently in the leasing process. It puts Virginia at the head of the class. And it makes McDonnell right. We rate his claim True.

pomt-06329	The city of Pembroke Pines doesn't have a vote in a plan to build a detention center in Southwest Ranches.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2011/nov/10/frank-ortis/pembroke-pines-vote-southwest-ranches/	Southwest Ranches is a tiny wealthy suburban enclave in western Broward County where some residents still ride horses, and the town once fought a street light proposal because residents didn't want the lights to interfere with their view of the stars. Now the rural-suburban oasis has become embroiled in controversy because of a longtime plan to build a jail. The town's plan to have a jail on the site had been publicly discussed for many years. But an uproar erupted in 2011, when U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement announced that it had tentatively selected the Southwest Ranches site for an immigration detention facility. The Miami-based Florida Immigrant Coalition, a pro-immigration group that opposes the jail, robo-called nearby residents. U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat who represents the area, wrote a letter of support for the project in April 2011, along with U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson. But as the controversy grew, Wasserman Schultz later wrote a letter to the town's mayor urging the town to hold a meeting with U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement (ICE), and that meeting occurred Nov. 5. Hundreds of residents gathered at a library to voice their concern. The Miami Herald described the meeting as a circus-like atmosphere -- replete with plenty of roving sheriff's deputies and a "First Amendment" area. The angry crowd was clearly against the project, and Mayor Frank Ortis, from neighboring Pembroke Pines, drew the biggest applause, the Miami Herald wrote. Watch Ortis on the city's video of the meeting starting around minute 76: "Let me just say that the longer I sit at this meeting, the angrier I'm getting," Ortis said. "Many of you who have contacted our office I've told you this is a Southwest Ranches issue. We don't have a vote in it. Let me just finish. We don't have a vote in it. This is what happens when you don't go to the people first." (The Herald's article also included most of that quote.) Ortis' passionate speech prompted someone at the meeting to suggest "Frank Ortis for governor." Ortis, first elected as a commissioner in 1996 and mayor in 2004, ingratiated himself with the angry opponents of the prison. But was he correct to state that Pembroke Pines doesn't have a vote in the project? Jail in works since 1990s First, some background on the immigration detention facility. A jail has been in the works in the area for decades. In 1991, Broward County commissioners agreed to buy nearly 70 acres in unincorporated southwest Broward for a future 4,000-bed county jail, which at the time would have been the nation's fifth-largest jailhouse, the Sun-Sentinel reported then. A jail overcrowding crisis prompted the county to buy the site, but in lieu of developing it the county expanded a jail facility in Pompano Beach instead. In 1998 Corrections Corporation of America, called CCA, bought an adjacent 24-acre site east of U.S. 27 between Sheridan Street and Stirling Road. CCA bought the land in response to a request for proposals from then-Sheriff Ron Cochran for a county jail for women, said Steve Owen, a CCA spokesman. Cochran died in 1997, and the next sheriff, Ken Jenne, cancelled seeking proposals. But CCA went ahead, believing that another government entity would want to send inmates there if it built a jail. In 2000, Southwest Ranches incorporated as a town, and in 2005 the town signed a deal with CCA to build the facility with the intention that the customer would be the federal government. CCA plans to build a facility for up to 1,500 beds, Owen told PolitiFact in an e-mail. (Some articles and documents cite higher figures, but Owen said an application to increase the number was withdrawn when ICE sought a smaller facility.) The details with ICE are still being worked out but once construction begins, it could be up and running in about 18 months. Once the prison is built and fully occupied, the town stands to earn than $1 million a year in taxes and fees. Pines commission voted multiple times about the prison While Southwest Ranches has been in the driver's seat here -- the town was responsible for approving the agreement with CCA, for example -- Pembroke Pines has played a role. Let's look at the votes that Pines has taken related to the prison project while Ortis has been mayor. For a list of the votes by the Pembroke Pines Commission, we turned to an email sent by Pembroke Pines City Manager Charlie Dodge to commissioners Oct. 5, and we then we turned to the city's minutes when available to verify the votes. Here is a summary of some of the key votes: • Sept. 21, 2005: The commission, along with Ortis, voted unanimously to notify Broward County that it objected to the 1,500-bed jail. But at the time, the town and city were embroiled in some unrelated spats about road lights and barricades the town had set up blocking drivers from Pines from traveling on certain Ranches roads. Pines' objection to the prison appeared to be more of a bargaining chip, because a few months later the city agreed to not fight the prison and the two municipalities reached an agreement on the roads. • December 21, 2005: The commission, along with Ortis, unanimously approved an agreement with Ranches that included language that stated, "The CITY shall not interfere with Corrections Corporation of America, or its successors or assigns, development and/or operation of the jail facility, or with the TOWN’S Agreement with Corrections Corporation of America concerning development of same." • June 27, 2011: The commission, along with Ortis, approved an agreement with the town to provide emergency medical and fire protection in exchange for $2.5 million annually starting Oct. 1. The agreement includes a section that states that "CITY acknowledges that it has sufficient capacity to deliver emergency medical protection and fire prevention services to the TOWN’s future 2,500 bed penal institution/deportation facility, located on property currently owned by the Corrections Corporation of America...." The agreement also states that it has capacity to provide water and sewer. The vote, which included Ortis, was unanimous. • Aug. 17, 2011: Commission, along with Ortis, unanimously approved a motion to begin providing fire service one month earlier than planned: Sept. 1, 2011. (The minutes were not available but city clerk Judy Neugent provided us with a draft copy.) Pines attorney cautions city against trying to stop service to jail site After opposition sparked a fury, Pembroke Pines city commissioners asked their attorney, Sam Goren, to explain if the city had to provide water and sewer to the jail facility after they had already voted to do so. Goren's conclusion: once the city agreed to provide water and sewer it couldn't back away -- the city could face a breach of contract. And, as the Pines lawyers wrote in a follow-up memo Sept. 21, the city already provides water and sewer to the area including to an adjacent women's prison. "The City’s denial of service to one facility while providing service to a similar adjacent facility may place the City in a legally tenuous position," said Goren in the memo. Broward County also played a role in paving the way for the prison. Based on county staff's recommendations, the county commission voted to amend the plat note on Dec. 13, 2005. The amendment changed the plat note from industrial use to a 1,500-bed correctional facility. Ortis responds We asked Ortis why he told the crowd "we don't have a vote in it." Ortis stood by his comments at the meeting and explained that the city of Pembroke Pines doesn't get a vote on whether the jail facility should be built. "It is a Southwest Ranches issue with CCA. They cut the deal, they voted for it, this project was Southwest Ranches. They signed it. We had no signature to it. We don't have a vote in the entity itself. ... We never had a vote to say yea or nay to it," he said. Pembroke Pines did vote to provide fire, water and sewer to the detention center, Ortis said, adding that the city already provides services to a nearby women's prison. "We had a 5-0 (vote) to do that," he said. "In my opinion, the five of us never thought that was a problem. ... Nobody objected to it, no one in the audience was objecting to it." Ortis said he doesn't think the detention facility belongs at that site, but that the decision rested with Southwest Ranches -- not Pines. Our ruling Ortis told the crowd of jail opponents: "Let me just say that the longer I sit at this meeting, the angrier I'm getting," Ortis said. "Many of you who have contacted our office I've told you this is a Southwest Ranches issue. We don't have a vote in it. Let me just finish. We don't have a vote in it. This is what happens when you don't go to the people first." Ortis' comments could have left protesters with the impression that as Pines mayor he didn't get to vote on the project. There is a kernel of a fact here: it was Southwest Ranches -- not Pembroke Pines -- that penned the deal with the prison operator, and Pines didn't get an up or down vote on whether the facility should be built. But it's not as if Pines has been in the dark here. Ortis, along with the rest of the commission, voted to provide services to the prison in 2011. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-03883	Says Texas has the most uninsured people of any state -- 6 million.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/mar/06/garnet-coleman/garnet-coleman-says-texas-has-highest-number-unins/	A Democratic state legislator aired a familiar — and flawed — claim on a Dallas TV station. On the Feb. 10, 2013, edition of WFAA-TV’s "Inside Texas Politics," Rep. Garnet Coleman of Houston, who hopes that Texas follows Florida and other states in opening Medicaid to more people, said: "We have the most uninsured people of any other state; it’s 6 million people." His remark was similar to a recent claim by the editorial board of the Sacramento Bee, which said Texas has the most uninsured residents. We rated that Mostly False after finding that more populous California has more uninsured residents. Drawing on U.S. Census Bureau research, the Kaiser Family Foundation keeps up with how many residents of each state have health coverage. Nationally in 2011, the foundation says, some 16 percent of the population was uninsured. In Texas, the foundation says, 24 percent of residents had no health insurance — and that was the highest uninsured rate for any state. Some 22 percent of Nevada residents and 21 percent of New Mexico residents lacked coverage, according to the foundation, while California and Louisiana were among five states where 20 percent of the population was uninsured. The foundation cites as a basis for these percentages the bureau’s continuing household surveys, which suggest slightly different levels of the uninsured dependent on whether the cited survey is a one-day snapshot or one that encompasses several years. Regardless, Texas has consistently had the highest uninsured rate. Another foundation chart shows, as Coleman said, that Texas had more than 6.1 million uninsured residents in 2011. But California had more, with 7.3 million uninsured, the chart says. California’s population exceeded Texas’ by some 12 million. Separately, we found a lower tally for Californians under age 65 who lack coverage in a December 2012 article by Paul Fronstin of the Washington-based Employee Benefit Research Institute, which says its mission is to enhance the development of sound public policy through objective research and education. A summary of that article opens: "In 2011, California had the largest number of people under age 65 without health insurance — 7.1 million — of any U.S. state. The percentage of uninsured Californians has risen steadily over the past two decades; the state now has the seventh-largest percentage of residents without coverage in the United States." The summary says, though, that the state’s share of uninsured residents should drop as the federal law known as Obamacare takes full effect. By email, Fronstin previously agreed California has more uninsured than Texas, pointing to his own analysis of Census Bureau survey research released in March 2012. Still, he said, 27 percent of Texans under 65 are uninsured, compared with 22 percent of Californians. Finally, we pulled down a bureau chart indicating the number of uninsured in each state from 1999 through 2011. Each of those years, it indicates, California had more uninsured residents than Texas, though the gap narrowed to about 500,000 residents in 2001, 2002 and 2007. California held its biggest edge in 1999 when, the bureau estimates, 6.4 million Golden State residents were uninsured compared to 4.3 million Texans. By email, Coleman conceded that his broadcasted comment was incorrect, saying: "Texas has the second-highest total number of uninsured people, with over 6 million uninsured," which he called dismal. Our ruling Coleman said Texas has the most uninsured residents. Texas continues to have highest percentage of uninsured residents in the nation, but, in raw numbers, California has about 1 million more uninsured residents. Coleman’s claim has an element of truth, yet it’s wrong on the numbers. We rate it Mostly False.	None	Garnet Coleman	None	None	None	2013-03-06T10:00:00	2013-02-10	['None']
pomt-03665	"If anyone should know irresponsible it should be Senator Buono. She’s the one, her budget left us with a $2 billion budget deficit in fiscal 10 that I had to fix. Her mistakes. And for fiscal year 2011 an $11 billion budget deficit. Her mistakes, along with her partner Jon Corzine."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/apr/28/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-he-entered-office-deficit-bi/	Some claims just never get old for Gov. Chris Christie. Take, for example, the existence of billions of dollars in deficits that awaited the new governor in January 2010, which he has now referenced at least five times. Christie described the burden during the "Ask The Governor" radio program that aired Monday on NJ101.5 FM. "If anyone should know irresponsible it should be Senator Buono. She’s the one, her budget left us with a $2 billion budget deficit in fiscal 10 that I had to fix. Her mistakes. And for fiscal year 2011 an $11 billion budget deficit. Her mistakes, along with her partner Jon Corzine." One legislator - who happens to be running against Christie in November's gubernatorial contest - and one predecessor solely responsible for billions in debt? Nice try, governor, but not entirely accurate. Let’s begin by explaining the budget process. New Jersey operates on a fiscal year beginning July 1 and ending the following June 30. The governor presents a budget, the Legislature reviews it, and the public and nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services offer input. The governor has final approval of the plan and must sign it by July 1. Buono chaired the state Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee and Jon Corzine was governor when the budgets in question were crafted. Now let’s look at both deficits. The first deficit was a $2.2 billion shortfall that existed when Christie took office on Jan. 19, 2010, more than halfway through the fiscal 2010 budget year. Christie fixed it by cutting more than 300 line items in the budget, including $475 million in school aid. The $11 billion deficit was actually a $10.7 billion structural deficit that the OLS projected for the fiscal 2011 budget year. A structural deficit measures how much money the state would need if current services and revenues remained the same, and all required funding obligations are fulfilled. But governors don’t have to keep state spending the same as it ever was. They can change services and approve a spending plan that doesn’t meet funding requirements. That’s what Christie did in the case of the $11 billion deficit: he didn’t fully fund the property tax rebate program or the school-aid formula, and he skipped a more than $3 billion payment into the state’s pension funds. Christie then dismissed structural deficits as "the old way of budgeting," and said New Jersey had switched to zero-based budgeting. Doing so made the $11 billion deficit ‘disappear,’ but the OLS still tracks such debt. Indeed, Christie’s $32.9 billion budget proposal for fiscal year 2014 contains a $3 billion structural deficit. It’s not unusual for governors to not fully fund required or expected costs, according to Raphael Caprio, a professor of Public Administration in the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. The pension fund is one example, he noted. So are Buono and Corzine at fault? "It is true when Christie came into office there was a roughly two billion dollar shortfall that needed to be corrected for during the current budget year and most of the budget year was under the bridge, and so the problem was exacerbated," Caprio said. "It probably was the result of multiple factors created from a perfect storm: we were still in recession, it was an election year, the previous administration probably should have paid closer attention, but it was what it was. "I think it’s probably a little over the top to say that Senator Buono was responsible for the $2 billion shortfall," he added. But Kevin Roberts, a Christie spokesman, said in an e-mail that Buono has frequently taken credit for the budgets in question, "saying her time as budget chair ‘speaks for itself.’" "We couldn't agree more," he said. "As budget chair and architect of Jon Corzine's budgets, Buono has openly and admittedly taken responsible for the policies that were so irresponsibly crafted, they blew a $2.2 billion hole in New Jersey’s deficit that fell to Governor Christie to fix." Buono for Governor spokesman David Turner said Christie is trying to deflect blame for his own "fiscally irresponsible budget gimmicks." "During a time when more than 400,000 people are looking for work, he has raided programs that would create jobs, underfunded our schools and delayed property tax relief for working and middle class families," Turner said in an e-mail. Our ruling Christie said, "If anyone should know irresponsible it should be Senator Buono. She’s the one, her budget left us with a $2 billion budget deficit in fiscal 10 that I had to fix. Her mistakes. And for fiscal year 2011 an $11 billion budget deficit. Her mistakes, along with her partner Jon Corzine." Although the budget is the chief responsibility of the governor, many are responsible for negotiating the document that ultimately becomes the state’s spending blueprint, Caprio said. Buono chaired the senate budget panel for the budgets referenced by Christie, but neither she nor Corzine are completely responsible for the deficits. Many factors were at play.

pomt-08350	In the past two years, Democrats have "spent more money than this country has spent in the last 200 years combined."	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2010/oct/27/eric-cantor/eric-cantor-tells-jon-stewart-us-spent-more-past-t/	During an Oct. 12, 2010, visit to Comedy Central's Daily Show with Jon Stewart, Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va., made a striking statement. "What you've seen (in Washington)," he said, "is a crowd that has taken advantage of a crisis back in late '08, early '09 and spent more money than this country has spent in the last 200 years combined, in the two years since." On the show, Stewart didn't challenge Cantor's claim, but we will. We first turned to historical tables from the Office of Management and Budget. One table, conveniently enough, details federal government spending since the birth of the modern Republic in 1789. We first looked at federal spending for 2009 and the estimate of spending for 2010. Combined, federal spending in those two years amounted to a little more than $7.2 trillion. We didn't have to add up all 200 years -- you only have to add together 2006, 2007 and 2008 to reach $8.3 trillion, which exceeds the $7.2 trillion of 2009 and 2010. So by that measure, Cantor is wrong. Want to use the data for 2010 and 2011 instead, under the assumption President Barack Obama was completely in charge for those budget years? Fine. Using those two years ups the total to a bit under $7.6 trillion. The three years before that by themselves total $9.2 trillion. So Cantor is wrong that way, too. What about using projected spending based on the course set by the Obama Administration and the Democratic Congress? Not even bending the rules to include the period 2009 to 2015 would do it. Outlays for the 2009-2015 period increases the cumulative amount of federal spending to about $27.3 trillion. Exceeding that amount only requires combining the federal spending from 1995 to 2008 -- a period of 14 years, not 200. So he's still wrong. What if Cantor misspoke, substituting "spent more money" for "created more debt"? We did that calculation with the help of a different OMB table. The increase in public federal debt between the end of 2008 and the end of 2010 has been almost $3.5 trillion. But the debt from the nation's birth through the end of 2008 was $5.8 trillion. So Cantor isn't right that way, either. When we asked Cantor's staff about it, they tried to move the goalposts. They told us Cantor was actually referring to the debt that will be added by 2015. That would be $8.2 trillion, which exceeds the $5.8 trillion debt accumulated between the birth of the republic and the end of 2008. (Actually, to make the numbers work, they only need to go as far as 2013, which would be the last budget assembled during President Barack Obama's first term.) But even though this number "works," it's not what Cantor said on the show. He didn't say debt, he said spending. And he said "in the two years since," when his staff later claimed he was actually referring to a seven-year period. Economists we spoke to on the left and the right agreed with our analysis and pointed out a few other problems with Cantor's claim. • Inflation. We used raw dollars, not inflation-adjusted dollars. But since a dollar is worth far less today than it was in the early 1800s, you can't genuinely compare dollar amounts from then to dollar amounts from today without making a mathematical adjustment. But if you did make that adjustment, it would take Cantor's claim even farther from the truth. • How do you assign responsibility for spending increases? As much as Republicans like to blame Obama and the Democratic Congress for the boom in federal spending, a sizable chunk of current spending was set on its course because of actions taken under President George W. Bush and the Republican Congress (such as the Medicare prescription drug benefit). This doesn't mean Obama and the Democratic Congress bear no responsibility for the rise in spending. They just don't deserve all the blame. • Does the comparison actually mean anything? From year to year, the economy grows, and so does population. It's only natural that as the size of the population grows and more money is available to spend, more money will be spent in an absolute sense. A more relevant comparison would be whether spending has grown disproportionately compared to the size of the economy. And as it happens, that would have provided Cantor with a striking statistic. According to OMB, the public debt will have risen from about 40 percent of gross domestic product at the end of 2008 to about 64 percent at the end of 2010 -- an increase by more than half over just a two-year span. But back to his words. He said that in the past two years, Democrats "spent more money than this country has spent in the last 200 years combined." That's wrong no matter how you slice it. And it's not just wrong -- it's ridiculously false. We rate the claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-15299	"A law was passed, apparently in the Clinton administration, about whether, in recruiting offices … Marines or other military should be able to have guns. Apparently it is prohibited."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2015/jul/21/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-law-passed-under-bill-clinton-banned/	A day after the shooting rampage at two military sites in Chattanooga that would ultimately take the lives of four Marines and a Navy petty officer, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush -- a Republican presidential candidate -- pointed the finger at former President Bill Clinton’s administration for a law that he said banned the carrying of guns by military recruiters. The shootings took place at two sites -- a military recruiting office in a strip mall and a Navy Operational Support Center. The gunman -- Mohammad Youssef Abdulazeez, 24, a native of Kuwait who had lived in Tennessee for most of his life -- was shot dead by police. Authorities are investigating the killings but haven’t yet confirmed a terrorist motive. Speaking at a Carson City, Nev., town hall on July 17, Bush said, "A law was passed, apparently in the Clinton administration, about whether, in recruiting offices … Marines or other military should be able to have guns. Apparently it is prohibited." Bush was one of several Republican candidates to call for an end to such a gun prohibition. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, another GOP presidential candidate, also pointed blame at Clinton. Bush’s claim raised two questions for us: Are guns prohibited at recruiting offices? And if so, is that due to a law passed under President Clinton? Policies about guns and the military As it turns out, there is a policy that’s relevant here -- but it’s not as straightforward as Bush suggests, and it wasn’t written under Clinton. It stemmed from an effort under Bush’s father, then-President George H.W. Bush. In 1992, when Bush was president, the Department of Defense issued a directive related to firearms for military personnel. That directive replaced an earlier one from 1986. The directive doesn’t specifically address recruiting offices, but it applies broadly to military sites. The 1992 directive, signed by then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Donald Atwood, didn’t outright ban military personnel from carrying weapons. Instead, it said that only certain employees could carry weapons, including those who worked in law enforcement, security and prisons. The directive also did not apply in certain situations, such as in war zones. The policy explains that the intent is "to limit and control the carrying of firearms by DoD military and civilian personnel." So the policy did cover most military personnel. Those who have opposed this policy have sometimes referred to it as a Clinton-era policy because the Army did release a regulation that implemented the Defense Department directive in March 1993, two months after Clinton took office. (For more on a similar claim that circulated after a mass shooting at the Washington, D.C., Navy Yard, see the fact-checking website Snopes.) A new Defense Department directive issued in April 2011 after a mass shooting at Ft. Hood in Texas tweaked the policy with some new phrases, including that workers have an "inherent right to self-defense." However, the overall policy essentially remained the same. Here is part of that directive: "Arming DoD personnel (i.e., administrative, assessment, or inspection, not regularly engaged in or directly supervising security or law enforcement activities) shall be limited to missions or threats and the immediate need to protect DoD assets or persons’ lives. DoD Components have the discretion to keep designated staff personnel qualified and available or on call to perform duties." The recruiting office where the shooting occurred represented all four branches of the military. We could not reach a spokesperson for the Marines. However Brian Lepley, a spokesman for U.S. Army Recruiting Command, said that "weapons are not permitted in recruiting stations by DoD because there are no law enforcement personnel there." Many on the Internet noted the gun-free sign on the military recruiting office door. "Once you cross that door, you are not allowed to have a weapon in there," Lepley said. The president’s role So should we blame Clinton -- or any president -- for the Department of Defense directive? "No, I wouldn’t," said Richard Brennan, a senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation and a career Army officer. "And frankly I’m unaware of any statute that prevents military personnel from carrying weapons. What there has been at least since 1975 when I was a cadet were policies and regulations that govern the circumstances under which military personnel can carry weapons." Over the years, those policies have consistently said that personnel working as law enforcement and protecting life or federal property can carry firearms. "There hasn’t been marked change in this," he said. While a president could get involved in this level of detail if they wanted to, this is generally settled at a lower pay grade. Such directives are "internally generated by a need seen either within civilian military leadership or military leadership," Brennan said. Typically, they update earlier policies, he added. Steven Bucci, a military expert for the Heritage Foundation and former Army colonel, told PolitiFact that the policy about firearms existed for decades before Clinton, or Bush for that matter. "As far back as when I joined the military in 1973, and probably further back, you have never been able to carry firearms, privately owned or government, on military installations. You always had to register it with the MP's and keep them locked in the arms rooms," he said, referring to military police. Bucci has disputed previous claims that President Clinton "disarmed" the military. "No one ‘disarmed’ the military -- the military itself prefers to manage good order and discipline by not having everyone armed," he told PolitiFact. In the wake of the shooting rampage in Tennessee, several lawmakers have said they plan to introduce bills to get rid of the military directive about firearms. Then-Rep. Steve Stockman, R-Texas, introduced a bill in 2013 to repeal the Defense Department directive and prohibit the military from instituting any restrictions on guns. But it never received a vote. We sent a summary of our findings about the defense directives to a spokeswoman for Bush. She reiterated his viewpoint. "The Clinton administration implemented this policy to prohibit guns in military recruitment offices," said Allie Brandenburger. "Gov. Bush believes military recruiters should be allowed to carry guns." Our ruling Bush said that "a law was passed, apparently in the Clinton administration, about whether, in recruiting offices … Marines or other military should be able to have guns. Apparently it is prohibited." The Department of Defense issued a directive, not a law, in 1992 -- when Bush’s father was president. It did not ban firearms outright; it limited them to military personnel who held certain jobs, such as positions in law enforcement. And while the Army issued a regulation implementing that directive in 1993 -- two months after Clinton was in office -- experts say it is not the sort of matter that would typically rise to the attention of a president. Bush has a point that, for the most part, military personnel can’t have firearms at recruiting offices. But most of everything else he said was incorrect. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-11126	Says Heidi Heitkamp has "never been interested in" regulatory relief "until all of a sudden I become a candidate for the Senate and put pressure on."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jun/04/kevin-cramer/kevin-cramer-distorts-heidi-heitkamps-record-banki/	North Dakota’s candidates for U.S. Senate are sparring over a new banking law they both co-sponsored that rolls back parts of Dodd-Frank, a signature banking regulatory law signed by former President Barack Obama. North Dakota Democrats bragged on Twitter that during the bill’s signing Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat, got a shoutout from President Donald Trump while Rep. Kevin Cramer, a Republican, lurked in the background. Cramer shot back that Heitkamp only discovered an interest in relieving regulations for banks after Cramer applied pressure. "We’ve sent over 40 of these types of bills to the Senate she’s never been interested in, until all of a sudden I become a candidate for the Senate and put pressure," Cramer told conservative radio host Rob Port. "All of a sudden she’s for a little bit of regulatory relief, and when I say little, I mean very little regulatory relief for the banking industry." We were curious: Did Heitkamp’s interest in regulatory relief flower overnight? It’s something other Democrats have criticized her for, so we wondered if it was an election-year stance. A review of the evidence shows that Heitkamp has been working on banking issues since she was elected in 2012. She joined the Senate Banking Committee in 2013. Heitkamp cosponsored the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, the law in question, on Nov. 16, 2017. Cramer announced his candidacy on Feb. 16, 2018. Heitkamp’s office said she has been working on the current law since 2013. She has also held over two dozen Senate Banking Committee hearings since 2015 on financial regulatory reform and over 30 discussions with top financial regulators. Heitkamp cosponsored a bill that was folded into law in 2015 to eliminate annual privacy notifications from banks, which cut red tape for community banks and credit unions. In 2014, Heitkamp also pressed for Obama to take into account community banks when naming a Federal Reserve governor. "During the entirety of (her tenure), she has often expressed a desire for regulatory relief for community banks and credit unions," said Rob Blackwell, editor of American Banker. "The idea that she’s a johnny-come-lately to regulatory reform just doesn’t hold water." Blackwell pointed us to a 2013 profile of Heitkamp that appeared in American Banker: "The North Dakota Democrat has emerged as a key player on the Banking Committee, helping to work on a bipartisan housing finance reform bill and championing legislation to provide relief to small banks," the profile reads. "In doing so, she has impressed bankers in her home state and her fellow legislators with her commitment to financial issues and willingness to work across the political aisle." Cramer’s campaign argued that Heitkamp did not support Cramer’s own House bills that aimed to curb more regulation. But the bills Cramer provided as evidence were more extreme and unlikely to garner Democratic support, Blackwell said. Our ruling Cramer said Heitkamp has "never been interested in" regulatory relief for banks "until all of a sudden I become a candidate for the Senate and put pressure on." Heitkamp has been an advocate of regulatory relief for small banks since she ran for the Senate in 2012. Cramer announced his Senate bid in February. Heitkamp’s lack of support for the regulatory relief that Cramer supports does not mean she is disinterested in regulatory relief. We rate this statement False.

pomt-12592	"Over the past 25 years, job growth in right-to-work states has been twice as high as in non-right-to-work states. ... The facts are just so clear that this is going to lead to more jobs and higher pay for the people of Missouri."	half-true	/missouri/statements/2017/apr/06/eric-greitens/greitens-not-quite-right-right-work/	It took less than a month for Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens to fulfill one of his campaign promises. On Feb. 6, Greitens signed a law making Missouri the 28th right-to-work state, part of his strategy to improve the state’s economic climate. Two days later, in a Fox News interview with Neil Cavuto, the Republican governor touted the effects of the legislation, saying Missouri has joined the ranks of states that have seen a considerable amount of job growth. Greitens said in the interview: "Over the past 25 years, job growth in right-to-work states has been twice as high as in non-right-to-work states. ... The facts are just so clear that this is going to lead to more jobs and higher pay for the people of Missouri." Right-to-work laws prohibit union security agreements, which limit a union’s ability to require employees to join. These contracts can include mandatory fees as a condition of employment. Greitens signed the bill into law on Feb. 6. The law will take effect Aug. 28. Opponents of Missouri’s right-to-work law say it will allow workers declining to pay union fees to reap the benefits of unions, which are required by federal law to protect all workers covered by a contract. Supporters say it will encourage employers to move to the state, thereby creating more jobs. We wondered how Greitens arrived at the statistic that job growth has been growing at a much faster rate in right-to-work states and, furthermore, if there was truly a relationship between job growth and right-to-work laws. The numbers are more complicated Parker Briden, a spokesman for the Missouri governor’s office, directed us to a 2015 article from the Illinois Policy Institute, a conservative, nonprofit think tank in Chicago. The article’s author, Michael Lucci, reported that the job growth in right-to-work states from 1990-2015 was 47 percent, while job growth in non-right-to-work states was 21 percent during the same time period. Using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Lucci calculated the percent change for nonfarm job growth in each state over the time period and placed them into two groups — one right-to-work, the other non-right-to-work. Lucci did not adjust the job numbers for population. Aggregating job growth totals from right-to-work and non-right-to-work states is not as accurate as comparing growth in individual states, according to Gordon Lafer, an associate professor at the University of Oregon and a former senior labor policy adviser for the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Education and Labor. Lafer has written in opposition of right-to-work laws. Lafer said the numbers are being driven by a few high job-growth states. "I would fail a freshman in college for turning that in," he said. "If Bill Gates walks into a bar, everyone there is a millionaire based on the average." An analysis of the data adjusted for population showed that of the eight states that saw more than 10 percent job growth from 1990 to 2015, six had right-to-work laws. On the other hand, a majority of the states that had a decrease in job growth were right-to-work states — nine out of 15. For what it’s worth, a comparison of the unemployment rate between the two groups of states suggests that there has been a smaller percentage of unemployed people in non-right-to-work states over the past few decades. Of the 10 states that had an increase of more than 10 percent in unemployment since 1990, half of those were right-to-work states. Four of the five states with the largest increases in unemployment were right-to-work states — Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina and South Carolina. But none of these numbers actually prove anything about the policy. Every state is governed by so many different factors affecting their economies that it’s difficult to pinpoint one policy as the economic driver using only Bureau of Labor Statistics data. "You’re supposed to say, all other things being equal, what is the effect of this policy?" Lafer said. "Can you prove it’s right-to-work that’s causing it?" Controlling for other factors, two case studies by researchers from the University of Nevada and Claremont McKenna College found mixed results on the economic effects of right-to-work. In a paper published in 2011, the authors wrote that Oklahoma’s right-to-work laws decreased private-sector union membership in the state but had no effect on job growth, per capita income and wages. Their case study on Idaho’s right-to-work laws found an increase in manufacturing jobs, but they had no effect on per capita income. What does affect job growth? What economists know for sure is that two main factors drive job growth — tax rates and education. Lafer said a policy like right-to-work might have been a larger incentive for companies in the 1940s and ’50s, but today the number of people in unions is so low that it doesn’t create the incentive it once did. He said companies today are more interested in moving to states with highly educated workforces, especially states with a large number of workers in STEM-related fields. Last year, 9.7 percent of Missourians were union members, lower than the U.S. average of 10.7 percent. Rik Hafer, a professor of economics in the Plaster School of Business & Entrepreneurship at Lindenwood University, said that it’s important to take many factors into consideration when thinking about whether a policy like right-to-work is actually linked to a state’s job growth. Factors like tourism, geography and culture can play a role in a company’s decision to move to a certain state. But more importantly, Hafer said, job growth is driven by an educated workforce and the individual and corporate taxes the company would face should it decide to move. A policy such as right-to-work might not be the make or break deal for Missouri jobs, but Hafer said it could "increase the chances of gaining new jobs." Right-to-work might play a more important role for cities that span the borders of two states, Hafer said. If a business could move just a few miles over to be in a state with a right-to-work law, it might choose to do so. Our Ruling Greitens said: "Over the past 25 years, job growth in right to work states has been twice as high as in non-right to work states. ... The facts are just so clear that this is going to lead to more jobs and higher pay for the people of Missouri." His information comes from a conservative think tank that had accurate numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics but used them in a way that experts say is unreliable for measuring the effect of a state law on its economy. Greitens used correct numbers but excluded important contextual information that might give someone a different impression of the figures. We rate this claim Half True. Correction: This story was corrected on April 6, 2017, to accurately describe the methodology used in the Illinois Policy Institute’s analysis of job growth in right-to-work and non-right-to-work states.

pomt-03937	"The only time in our history when the debt has been higher than this was the end of World War II."	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2013/feb/20/david-cote/millionaire-honeywell-ceo-david-cote-compares-toda/	One day before President Barack Obama delivered his "State of the Union" address, David Cote, president of Honeywell International and a member of the president’s debt commission, shared his own thoughts. And Cote’s outlook wasn’t quite as rosy. Cote, a New Hampshire native, returned to the Granite State Monday, Feb. 11, in a forum hosted by "Fix the Debt," a nonpartisan campaign to address the nation’s fiscal challenges. "The recession created a huge issue for us," Cote said during the event, held at Saint Anselm College in Manchester. "The only time in our history when the debt has been higher than this was the end of World War II," he said. "When you think about it that way, it puts into perspective the difficulty of what we're dealing with." Now, PolitiFact has checked a lot of claims about the debt and whether the majority of the debt is Obama’s fault. Those typically land on the false end of the Truth-o-Meter. New Hampshire’s junior Senator Kelly Ayotte compared the amount of debt under Obama to the amount accrued under George Bush and got more favorable results. But here, Cote wasn’t lobbing the blame grenade. In hard dollars, there’s little question that the debt is higher than ever before. On Feb.11, the day of the event, the debt stood at $16.49 trillion-- nearly $10 trillion more than 2002 and almost four times as much as ten years before that, according to Treasury records. However, economists rarely use hard dollars to measure the size of the debt. Rather, they compare the debt total to the country’s gross domestic product -- the value of all goods and services produced in the U.S. in a year -- to get a better picture of the true scale of the debt. In his remarks, Cote referenced the debt to GDP ratio several times and it was clear he wasn’t talking about raw dollars. Currently, the $16 trillion debt makes up about 73 percent of GDP, Cote said, citing the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to support his claim. So, does that number rate as the second highest in history? We decided to check the records. As part of its annual Long-Term Budget Outlook, CBO officials list the debt-to-GDP ratio going back to the 1790, the year after the Constitution took effect. That year, the nation held a debt of $71 million, which reflected about 30 percent of GDP, according to budget office records. By way of quick history lesson,"The U.S. was born in debt," wrote Matt Phillips, a reporter for the Atlantic, wrote in a November article, "The Long Story of U.S. Debt, From 1790 to 2011, in 1 Little Chart.". "Where did that debt come from?" Phillips asked. "Well, the Continental Congress, the rough equivalent of the Federal government in revolution-era America, lacked the power to tax. It first tried to pay for stuff by printing money. This currency, known as the Continental, collapsed." The debt ratio rose and fell over the coming years, in line with the wars ongoing at the time. During the Civil War, the ratio rose from 2 percent in 1860, the year before the war began, to 35 percent, a record at the time, in 1865, when the war came to an end. "The public debt surged from about $65 million in 1860 to $2.76 billion in 1866," Phillips wrote, citing CBO figures. "The debt would never get below $900 million again." And, nearly 60 years later, the debt ratio jumped once again during World War I, rising from 3 percent in 1916, the year before the United States entered the war, to 33 percent in 1919, when the war ended. "Often during wartimes, you see both sides of the equation growing," John Harvey, a professor of economics at Texas Christian University, said this week. "It’s a big increase in spending, without question. But, often, it’s a big increase in revenue, as well," said Harvey, who wrote an article, "Why Our Current National Debt is not the Largest in History," last year for Forbes magazine. The debt ratio began to fall once again in the aftermath of World War I. But, in 1929, the stock market crash launched the Great Depression, which then led to increases in government spending under the New Deal, and the debt ratio rose sharply to 44 percent, a record at the time, in 1940. From there, World War II led to unprecedented growth, both in national spending and debt accumulation. By the end of the war, the ratio rose to 106 percent in 1945 and 109 percent in 1946. "American manufacturing made a killing (during the war), but the government debt to pay for everything was huge," Ron Haskins, a senior economic fellow with the Brookings Institution, wrote in an email to The Telegraph. "We paid more than our fair share of war costs as well as post-war costs (like the Marshall Plan)." The debt ratio remained high in the years following the war -- higher than the current 73 percent ratio. By 1951, it dipped to 67 percent, and despite some peaks and valleys over the coming decades, it did not reach the 70 percent threshold again until 2012. "This one isn’t really the wars. These two wars (in Iraq and Afghanistan) were actually pretty small," said Harvey, the TCU economics professor. "More of it is because of the economy," he said. "When the economy is doing poorly, tax revenues go down because there aren’t as many jobs. At the same time, more people are qualifying for welfare and social assistance, so that drives up costs. … That’s what we’re seeing now." Our ruling In hard dollars, it’s not even close. The current $16.49 trillion debt is far larger than at any other point in U.S. history. But, the debt-to-GDP ratio tells a different story. The current ratio, 73 percent, is among the nation’s highest. But, as Cote notes, it still has a ways to go to get to the 106 and 109 percent levels reached during and after World War II. However, Cote was unspecific about comparing today’s debt to the exact end of World War II in August, 1945, or the era following the war. As noted, the debt remained higher for six years after the war than it is today. We rate Cote’s claim Mostly True.	None	David Cote	None	None	None	2013-02-20T20:22:50	2013-02-11	['None']
pomt-14858	"Net immigration from Mexico last year was zero. Fact-check me."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/14/martin-omalley/martin-omalley-net-migration-mexico-was-0-2014/	At the Democratic debate in Des Moines, former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley shared a statistic that he said you would never hear out of one of the leading Republican presidential candidates. "Let’s say it in our debate because you’ll never hear this from that immigrant-bashing carnival barker Donald Trump: The truth of the matter is net immigration from Mexico last year was zero. Fact-check me. Go ahead, check it out," O’Malley said. Challenge accepted. We actually wrote about this back in June when former President Bill Clinton said something similar. When we did that fact-check, we didn’t have the 2014 data yet. So let’s revisit what we found with the addition of the most recent data, which is the crux of O’Malley’s claim. One way to measure net migration -- the number of new arrivals versus the number who leave -- is the count of people living in America who were born in Mexico. The Census Bureau tracks this. We used two sets of numbers from the American Community Survey -- an estimate based on three years of surveys and an estimate based on just the year the survey took place. (For the 2014 data, a three-year estimate is not currently available.) Year Born in Mexico 3-year average estimate (1,000s) 1-year estimate (1,000s) 2014 n/a 11,714 2013 11,604 11,585 2012 11,650 11,563 2011 11,700 11,673 2010 11,642 11,711 Source: American Community Survey According to Census Bureau data, the number of U.S. residents born in Mexico dropped each year from 2010-13. It bounced back up in 2014, but it remains lower than the peak in 2007, said Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. "That is not a small statistical difference, but it's small compared to the days of rapid Mexican immigration from 1994 to 2007," Nowrasteh said. "O'Malley was mostly correct. The population increased but it was small. Mexican immigration certainly isn't surging anymore." The margin of error is large enough that the actual number of Mexican-born people living in America in 2014 could be lower than it was in 2013. Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors reduced immigration, told us back when we looked into Clinton’s claim that the Mexican-born figures are a valid indicator of the overall trend. While there’s a little variation, both estimates show fewer people from 2010 to 2013. "This strongly implies zero net (migration)," Camarota said. Four reasons for the decline Why is migration from Mexico to the United States slowing down? Demographics is possibly the biggest driver. The birth rate in Mexico has fallen steadily since at least 1990 and now stands at 2.2 children per woman. Marc Rosenblum at the Migration Policy Institute said that translates into fewer people coming into the workforce. Rosenblum told us that apprehensions at the border strongly suggest that fewer people are trying to sneak into the country. Data from the U.S. Border Patrol show a drop of more than 50 percent since 2009. It used to be border agents stopped over half a million people coming in from Mexico. Last year, it was about 230,000. More surveillance, stiffer penalties and more barriers at the border have had the intended effect, he said. Other drivers include the hit on the construction industry during the recession. That was a sector that drew many immigrants, and while it has recovered a bit, it is not nearly as robust as it once was. Plus, according to one survey, Mexicans who return to their native country generally find that they make more money than when they left. Our ruling O’Malley said, "Net immigration from Mexico last year was zero. Fact-check me." Census data from 2010 up to 2013 support O’Malley’s point, as the population of people living in America but born in Mexico fell by about 40,000 since 2010. Experts said this is a strong indication of a prevailing trend. That figure actually rose slightly in 2014 -- though remaining significantly lower than the peak number of Mexican-born Americans in 2007. And the 2014 number had a large enough margin of error that it’s possible there was an actual drop from 2013. Other data, including a rapid decline in apprehensions at the border and changing demographics in Mexico add weight to the conclusion that O’Malley’s point is correct. With a caveat that the measurements aren’t perfect, we rate this statement Mostly True.	None	Martin O'Malley	None	None	None	2015-11-14T23:50:06	2015-11-14	['Mexico']
pomt-08765	Rob Portman is "the one who actually sucked the jobs out of the (Mahoning) Valley and sent them to China."	false	/ohio/statements/2010/aug/25/lee-fisher/lee-fisher-says-rob-portman-actually-sucked-jobs-o/	Lee Fisher has stopped tap-dancing around it. Ohio’s Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate used to suggest that his opponent, Rob Portman, played a big role in promoting job-killing free trade agreements. But on July 31 in Youngstown, Fisher ditched the notion that Portman was just a cog in the wheel, conferring new status on his Republican rival: Portman was at the controls of the job-sucking vacuum. "I’m running against Congressman Portman, who was George Bush’s trade advisor," Fisher said while campaigning in the Mahoning Valley. "He’s the one who actually sucked the jobs out of the Valley and sent them to China." With apologies to H. Ross Perot, who famously described the "giant sucking sound" of jobs going abroad, Fisher was getting at the heart of an Ohio campaign issue. He was saying to the voters of the Youngstown region: If you’ve lost your job, as many around here have, blame it squarely on Rob Portman. How can you prove something like that? We asked, and the Fisher campaign provided several statistics and pieces of information, which fit together like this: First, Portman was a Republican member of Congress who voted in 2000 for normalized trade relations with China. That opened the door to more Chinese imports here, and more American exports to China, without the annual reviews of human rights violations that used to be required before Chinese trade could go forward. Next, Portman was President George W. Bush’s trade ambassador from May 2005 to April 2006. And as trade ambassador, Portman supported Bush’s decision in December 2005 to turn down American steel makers who wanted import restrictions against China. The U.S. International Trade Commission, an independent fact-finding panel within the Commerce Department, had recommended the protections because Chinese steel pipe imports were surging into the United States, threatening the domestic pipe industry. But Bush had the ultimate say, and he decided that the potential harm to the United States economy, including to the construction industry, was too great to restrict the Chinese pipe. Portman reiterated that view as well, when asked about the decision by a member of Congress in 2006. Here’s what happened because of these actions, Fisher says. The trade deficit with China went from $162 billion in 2004 to $202 billion in 2005. Furthermore, the trade deficit with China between 2000 and 2008 cost Ohio 91,800 jobs, according to the Economic Policy Institute, or EPI, a labor-affiliated think tank whose work is cited by Fisher. Those job losses, according to EPI, included 5,500 in the 17th Congressional District, which includes most of the Mahoning Valley and a swath of Akron, and 3,300 in the 6th Congressional District, which includes Boardman, just south of Youngstown. In the steel tube and pipe industry alone, 500 jobs were lost in the United States, including some in Mahoning Valley plants, because of trade abuses by China, according to a Plain Dealer story in 2008 that Fisher’s aides cited. Fisher’s trade deficit figures, provided by the Census Bureau, are good, although they do not specifically measure the trade imbalance in the Mahoning Valley. That would be impossible to measure because thorough import data is not available at the local level. But numbers for the other side of the ledger, exports, are available at the local level. From 2005 to 2006, while Portman was trade ambassador, the value of exports from the Youngstown-Warren-Boardman metropolitan area rose by 10.7 percent, to $1.25 billion, according to Commerce Department data we reviewed independently of the Fisher and Portman campaigns. Exports from the Youngstown metro area rose by only 2 percent the following year, but by 2008 they had jumped by another 14 percent, Commerce figures show. So if you were viewing only exports, you might say that trade deals helped the Youngstown area. But several experts, as well as economic data, suggest that exports were hardly enough to compensate for job losses. In fact, if any place in America has faced tough times, it is the Mahoning Valley. In 2000, there were 224,200 private-sector jobs in the Youngstown metro market. By the end of last year, there were 187,800, a 16 percent drop over the decade, according to figures we reviewed from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The biggest hits have been in heavy manufacturing, including the once-dominant steel industry, and with those hits came losses in the service industries that supported communities, according to Robert E. Scott, a senior international economist at EPI. The Mahoning Valley’s economic decline began in the 1970s with steel imports from Japan, says John Russo, director of labor studies and co-director of the Center for Working-Class Studies at Youngstown State University. But China picked up the mantle later, and foreign trade has absolutely created a drag on the economy, Russo says. There’s no disputing that since 2000, things in the valley have gotten worse. So we also won’t quibble here with EPI’s figures for trade-related job losses, partly because no one else has come up with an accurate measurement. But EPI’s numbers are actually an "estimate of labor displacement," the think tank says, or an extrapolation drawn from employment statistics, census data and trade data. The figures, EPI says, seek to measure the result of the trade imbalance regardless of its causes, which include dumping of cheaper products in this country, price controls in foreign countries, steep tariffs to U.S. products abroad, and currency manipulation by China. We are leery for a different reason, however, of using the EPI numbers to support Fisher’s claim. EPI’s figures include eight years of job losses, and Portman was trade ambassador for only 11 months. Although he was in Congress before joining the White House, Portman was one of 237 House members to vote for trade with China, and the measure passed by a margin of 40 votes. Then-President Bill Clinton fought to get that result, yet Fisher is not blaming Clinton – or Portman’s 163 Republican and 73 Democratic colleagues who also voted for passage in the House -- for sucking jobs out of the Mahoning Valley. We admit, the bar here for Fisher is high. That’s because Fisher said that Portman is "the one" who caused the jobs to go away. Is Fisher’s claim fair? "To the extent that he failed to deal with these things, he contributed to the problem," said Scott, of EPI. We put the same question to Russo at Youngstown State, and he said Fisher’s statement could be considered partly true. You could blame Portman, he said, and Bush, and former and successive trade ambassadors, and corporate CEOs, and China for manipulating its currency and raising barriers to U.S. exports, and Treasury secretaries, and anybody else who has been involved in Chinese manufacturing and trade policy. The list goes on and on, Russo says, and includes members of both parties who have failed to develop a real strategy for dealing with manufacturing. By the same token, Fisher was state development director during some of the worst job losses, in charge of retaining Ohio jobs and attracting new ones. Using Labor Department data, we determined that the Youngstown metro area shed 16,900 jobs -- an 8.25 percent loss -- during the time Fisher led the state’s job retention efforts. Was Fisher "the one" responsible for those losses? We’re not contending that. Rather, we’re raising the point because the economic forces that caused the entire region to fall are beyond any single person – even a candidate for Senate. So we go back to Fisher’s words: "He’s the one who actually sucked the jobs out of the Valley and sent them to China." That’s a big responsibility for one man, even if he was trade ambassador for 11 months. Too big, we think. That’s why we rate Fisher’s claim False. Comment on this item.

pomt-02187	"My Treasury team eliminated a 900-case backlog in the Crime Victim Compensation Program."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/apr/27/gina-raimondo/raimondo-touts-having-cleared-900-claims-backlogge/	As a candidate for governor, state General Treasurer Gina Raimondo has been touting her experience in the venture capital business as an asset when it comes to running the treasurer’s office, and possibly the rest of state government. On her campaign website, under the headline "Making Government Work," she says she implemented a strategy to streamline management in her office. As evidence, she claims that under her tenure, the treasurer’s office cleared a 900-claim backlog in the state Crime Victim Compensation Program that had been building up for years. She makes a similar claim on the treasurer’s website. We decided to check her claim on those claims. The Crime Victim Compensation Program pays grants to Rhode Island crime victims or their family members. Awards can be used to help pay for expenses such as health insurance deductibles, medical care, lost wages, mental health therapy, crime scene cleanup or funeral costs. Individual victims often file more than one claim, but the maximum amount any one person can receive is $25,000. Most of the program’s money comes from fines and assessments levied in the state courts, augmented by federal funds. When we asked Raimondo’s office for backup, her staff provided a breakdown of the unresolved claim backlog that they said they found after sorting through the compensation program’s files when she took office in 2011. It comprised 912 claims by 415 people. The names of the individuals and the doctors or health care providers who were paid were redacted from the documents we received. Treasurer’s office spokeswoman Joy Fox said fund staffers began going through the paperwork in the files around the middle of 2011, finishing around November. During that time they found instances in which claims had been filed but not decided, and others in which claims had been approved but not paid. The accounting listed the date that each backlogged claim was filed, how much was sought, when it was approved or denied, how much was awarded if it had been approved, when the check was issued and the check number. The earliest claim went back to 2007. After the list was compiled, Fox said the effort to resolve them began in January 2012. According to the payment accounting from Raimondo’s office, by June of 2012 about 95 percent of the claims had resolved. The remainder, 47 claims, were finished by December 2012. Since then, the average wait time for a new claim to be resolved is 28.9 days, the treasurer’s office said in its 2013 annual report on the program to the General Assembly. Of the 912 claims, 391 were approved for some kind of award, about 43 percent. The total amount paid out on those came to $681,890.67. We wanted to find independent verification of that figure. So we went to the treasurer’s office online "transparency portal," which lists the checks issued by the state in given fiscal years. We looked for the 391 checks on the backlog list and found 310 matches -- enough to give us confidence in Raimondo’s figure. Fox said the rest don’t show individually on the transparency portal because the state consolidates multiple payments to single health care service providers into a single combined number for each payee. Our ruling Gina Raimondo said her office was able to resolve 900 pending claims from the state’s Crime Victim Compensation Program since she became general treasurer in 2011. Her staff provided an accounting that outlined the effort. It showed 912 claims resolved, 12 more than she said. We independently verified enough of the claims to rule her statement True.

pomt-12985	"The causation standard in Indiana is exactly the same as it is in Illinois."	true	/illinois/statements/2016/dec/19/david-menchetti/illinois-indiana-work-comp-law-same-words-differen/	One of the hottest and most divisive topics in Illinois politics for the last 18 months has been workers’ compensation reform. Gov. Bruce Rauner and business groups say the state’s workers’ compensation system is unfairly biased against employers and has led, in the most recent national report, to Illinois having the eighth highest workers’ compensation insurance rates in the nation. Two dominant themes have emerged in the workers’ compensation debate. One is that Indiana has been a magnet for Illinois business relocations because it has very low workers’ compensation insurance rates. The other is that Illinois has high rates because of the state’s "no-fault" workers’ compensation system. Any injury "arising out of and in the course of employment" is compensable with workers’ compensation benefits, including medical care and paid time off for recovery. In legal terms, Illinois has no-fault standard of "causation." Thus, a pre-existing condition that is aggravated in the course of work is covered under workers’ compensation. Given all this, a statement made during an Illinois House committee hearing on a workers’ compensation reform bill might have struck an odd chord. "The causation standard in Indiana is exactly the same as it is in Illinois," said David Menchetti, a labor attorney with the Chicago firm Cullen Haskins Nicholson Menchetti. Menchetti testified at the hearing in opposition to the bill, which would change Illinois’ causation standard to the one described in Rauner’s reform agenda. If Indiana is attracting businesses away from Illinois because of its low workers’ compensation insurance premiums, and if Illinois’ no-fault causation standard is the cause of its high insurance rates, could Indiana really have the same legal standard as Illinois? We decided to check. Turnaround Rauner’s Turnaround Agenda contains a section devoted solely to enhancing the state’s causation standard, and he has spoken extensively about the need to switch to a standard in which workers’ compensation benefits aren’t granted unless the workplace is "more than 50 percent responsible for the injury compared to all other causes." He’s also been vocal about Illinois losing jobs and businesses to Indiana because of, among other things, Illinois’ high workers’ compensation insurance premiums. "We should be kickin’ tails, and look what’s happening to us," Rauner said in a speech in August at the Illinois State Fair. "Our jobs are going to Indiana. Come on. They’re going to Indiana. They ain’t going there for the weather." Rauner is not the first to invoke the state’s causation standard as problematic for businesses. In a 2012 brief, Attorney General Lisa Madigan wrote, "To protect taxpayer dollars, the legislature must address and change the causation standard that is currently applied by the IWCC and the courts." The attorney general’s office, however, has never advocated for a specific standard and has not issued an official opinion on Rauner’s proposal. "From our perspective, there ought to be reasonable ways to change the standard that would not damage the purpose of workers’ compensation to ensure that employees who are injured on the job can fully recover," Madigan’s chief of staff, Anne Spillane, told Politifact Illinois in September. The codes The Illinois Workers’ Compensation Act invokes the term "arising from and in the course of" employment seven times in defining injuries subject to workers’ compensation. Likewise, the Indiana Workers’ Compensation code (ICC 22-3-6-1-[e]) defines "injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment" as compensable under the state’s workers’ compensation system. By contrast, Florida -- whose causation standard Rauner wants to replicate in Illinois -- adds a conditional clause in its code: "If an injury arising out of and in the course of employment combines with a preexisting disease or condition to cause or prolong disability or need for treatment, the employer must pay compensation or benefits required by this chapter only to the extent that the injury arising out of and in the course of employment is and remains more than 50 percent responsible for the injury as compared to all other causes combined and thereafter remains the major contributing cause of the disability or need for treatment. Major contributing cause must be demonstrated by medical evidence only." (440.09 [b]) But if Indiana and Illinois have identical causation standards in their workers’ compensation statutes, why are Indiana’s insurance premiums so much cheaper than those paid by businesses in Illinois? Menchetti cites two primary reasons. One is that Indiana pays significantly lower workers’ compensation benefits. The other, he says, is that employers in Indiana, not injured employees, have first choice in medical treatment. A national compilation of workers’ compensation laws by the Workers’ Compensation Research Institute confirms that the initial choice of treating physician in Indiana lies with the employer, while in Illinois the choice is the employee. A 2015 report by nonprofit, investigative journalism website ProPublica shows that, on benefits for permanent partial disability, Illinois consistently paid more than the national average while Indiana generally was close to average. (Compensation for loss of an arm in Illinois, for example, is $439,858. The national average is $169,878, and Indiana pays $202,050.) More than just causation While the statutes in Indiana and Illinois may use the same definition for causation, how the law is interpreted and applied makes the difference on cost, says Michael Lucci, who has studied workers’ compensation and written extensively about it for the libertarian Illinois Policy Institute, which favors Rauner’s reform agenda. "I think the difference you’ll find is largely subject to judicial interpretation and arbitration rulings," Lucci says. "Causation is a difficult issue. We haven’t engaged particularly hard on this issue." In a recent analysis, Lucci offered a seven-point plan for reducing Illinois’ workers’ compensation insurance premiums. Changing the causation standard was not among them. The difference between eighth-most-expensive Illinois and second-least-expensive Indiana for workers’ compensation insurance, Lucci says, can’t be bridged by changing the causation wording alone. "Their arbitrators have a narrower view of what constitutes a workplace injury," Lucci says. Our ruling Attorney David Menchetti testified before the Illinois House Labor and Commerce Committee that, "The causation standard in Indiana is exactly the same as it is in Illinois." State workers’ compensation statutes in both states confirm that Indiana and Illinois both are "no-fault" states in which an injury need only happen in the workplace to be covered by workers’ compensation. Both define qualifying injuries as those as those arising from employment with no other conditions. As noted in statements from Menchetti and Lucci -- who are on opposite sides of the larger workers’ compensation reform issue -- the causation standard’s effect on workers’ compensation insurance rates is open to debate. The standard itself in Illinois and Indiana statutes is not. We rate this statement True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/94311f61-1859-49ec-bb92-3464f6214170	None	David Menchetti	None	None	None	2016-12-19T17:19:09	2016-11-28	['Illinois', 'Indiana']
pomt-05243	Says "city leadership is threatening to lay off police and emergency services personnel to balance the budget."	false	/tennessee/statements/2012/jun/03/memphis-police-association/memphis-police-union-says-mayor-wharton-threatened/	At a recent meeting with The Commercial Appeal editorial board, Memphis Mayor A C Wharton showed a side to his personality seldom seen in his many years of public service -- anger. The subject -- commercials being aired by the Memphis Police Association, the union representing Memphis’s police officers. The ads claim the city’s "leadership" has used city tax money and offered tax breaks to companies like Mitsubishi and Electrolux, and then warns that "city leadership is threatening to lay off police and emergency services personnel to balance the budget." Wharton said he had been seeing the ads running "24-7" and that "it really irks me." Coming from Wharton, whose reputation for a calm demeanor goes back to his days as one of the area’s most esteemed courtroom lawyers, that qualifies as a tirade. So we decided to take a closer look at the charges. The commercial is part of a larger campaign by the MPA called "Wake Up, Memphis!" that includes a dedicated home on the MPA website and handouts. In an appearance with Fox 13 News, MPA president Mike Williams said, "It’s not our intention to irk the mayor off." But did the union go too far in its criticism? Wharton has consistently said, since winning a special election in 2009, that he would do everything possible to avoid cuts in public safety. Mayoral spokeswoman Mary Cashiola wrote in an email: "In the budgets he has presented, laying off fire and police personnel has never been submitted, planned, or agreed to at any level." In an email response, MPA vice president Essica Littlejohn confirmed that by "city leadership," the MPA was referring to Wharton, providing links to two TV news reports featuring interviews with the mayor. She names Wharton specifically and says that he "expressed that police and fire would not be exempt from layoffs as in years past, although that option would be a last resort. It is our belief that Mayor Wharton planted the seed of police and fire layoffs to soften the blow regarding the need for a property tax increase. So to answer your question, yes, there were definitely threats made to lay off police and fire personnel." One of the TV reports, from WPTY’s ABC 24, does indeed lead with this sentence: "Mayor A C Wharton is considering police and fire department layoffs in Memphis as he prepares to present his budget ideas to city council members next week." Another, from WMC’s Action News 5, has this headline: "Memphis police, firefighters could face layoffs." The station even used this wording in the web address to try to attract the attention of search engines like Google: "police-and-firemen-now-included-in-city-layoffs." So, case closed, right? Not exactly, at least when you look at what the mayor said rather than how the TV stations teased the pieces to entice viewers. Wharton told ABC 24: "I made it a cardinal principle we would not take any boots off the street. But things are so challenging now, I'm not going to rule out anything. Obviously that would be my last resort." This is what Wharton told Action News 5: "I'm not saying yes, I'm not saying no. I'm simply saying that when we go before the council, we will have looked at everything." He also said, "For the whole time I've been in office, that's the first thing we want to protect." The mayor’s spokeswoman, Cashiola, contends that "the Mayor’s statement about it being a last resort shouldn’t be taken as a threat but an indicator of something he did not plan to do. Calling those layoffs a last resort means just that – everything else would be tried before public safety would even receive the slightest consideration." The budget the mayor presented, in fact, not only did not propose layoffs for public safety personnel but in fact proposed an overall increase in spending on public safety. Memphis Fire Department director Alvin Benson even said that there will be hiring to replace employees lost through attrition. Despite that, the commercials continued to run and remain highlighted on the MPA’s website. Our ruling In trying to influence the Memphis budget hearings, the Memphis Police Association ran commercials claiming that a mayor who still has never proposed cuts in public safety areas was "threatening to lay off police and emergency services personnel to balance the budget." Though the mayor said he was "not going to rule out anything" he never said there were serious plans to lay off cops or emergency services personnel. In fact, he said such moves would be a "last resort" and the budget he eventually proposed calls for increased spending on public safety. We therefore rule the police union’s statement False.

Scott Walker and "so far in 2015 over 6,685 people have been laid off, already more than in all of 2014."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jul/10/american-bridge-21st-century/american-bridge-21st-century-says-layoffs-show-eco/	Job creation was the No. 1 issue for Republican Scott Walker in his first term as Wisconsin governor, and the state’s economic performance will be examined in depth as his presidential campaign gets underway. The left-leaning American Bridge 21st Century tried to kick-start that conversation with a blog post July 1, 2015 that carried this headline: "Walker’s economy gets worse." The item said: "Scott Walker’s Wisconsin: So far in 2015 over 6,685 people have been laid off, already more than in all of 2014." It continued: "How much has Scott Walker tanked Wisconsin’s economy? In addition to having the slowest job growth in the Midwest, Wisconsin layoff notices just passed the total layoffs in all of 2014 and are set to be the highest of Walker’s tenure by 4,000." That’s a lot of baggage to unpack. We have done numerous items about Scott Walker and jobs, this is the first about layoffs. Is the group right that layoffs for 2015 have surpassed those in 2014, and that the situation is evidence the economy has "tanked"? How the system works In Wisconsin, businesses are required to file warning notices with the state when they anticipate ending employment for more than 50 workers. Wisconsin’s law is more strict than federal law, which requires notices for layoffs of more than 100 workers. As part of its claim, American Bridge linked to a June 30, 2015 report by WKOW-TV in Madison, which compared the number of people covered by layoff warning notices received by the state so far in 2015 with those for all of 2014. When we looked at the state Department of Workforce Development web site, we could not find the same numbers, but did see the same trend. As of July 8, 2015, the tally for 2015 was 8,627, compared with 7,239 in all of 2014. But the warning notices are a lousy tool to assess the economy -- and especially employment. Why? Some layoffs never trigger a notice, because they don’t reach the 50 person threshold. Also, the notices don’t always mean lost jobs. In cases when a company changes hands, the old firm is required to file a notice, even if all the workers will retain their jobs with the new firm. So it is wrong to equate the notices with bodies out the door, as American Bridge did. The "data is interesting, but not very useful," said Brian Jacobsen, an economist at Wells Fargo and a professor at Wisconsin Lutheran College. "If you think about the number of employees affected, it's relatively small." Jacobsen noted layoffs are sometimes announced and then phased in over a number of years. "Thankfully, some of those notices change, resulting in fewer employees being affected," he said. "Some employers may err on the side of giving a warning even if there is a chance the layoffs won't occur." Another factor that the layoff notices don’t reflect is the number of jobs that have been added to the economy. Based on the most solid numbers available, through the first four months of 2015, state private sector employers added 13,300 jobs. That compares with 10,600 jobs in the same time frame in 2014. (Numbers for May are preliminary) Other indicators also suggest more of an upswing rather than a tumble. -- The Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce economic trends report from July 1, 2015. "Currently the metro area’s economic environment is marked by a solid majority of indicators in aggregate pointing upward, led largely by an improving job situation," said Bret Mayborne, the MMAC’s economic research director. "In addition, local housing and real estate indicators have been contributing to this growth trend over the past nine months." -- The most recent quarterly survey by ManpowerGroup Inc. Issued June 8, 2015, the report said employers in Wisconsin as well as the Milwaukee metro area expect "bullish" and "prosperous" hiring prospects in the coming quarter. Our rating American Bridge 21st Century says that Wisconsin’s economy tanked under Scott Walker and uses layoff notices filed with the state as evidence. But the notices do not represent bodies out the door and, though higher than last year, they are not a reliable economic indicator. Indeed, other reports say that employers overall added about 13,000 jobs in the first five months of the year, a pace higher than a year ago. We rate the claim False. (Editor's note: The paragraph about 2015 job totals was edited for clarity, to reflect the figure is for the first four months of 2015 -- the ones for which final monthly numbers are available. Final numbers for May 2015 are not available.)	None	American Bridge 21st Century	None	None	None	2015-07-10T11:30:00	2015-07-01	['Scott_Walker_(politician)', 'Wisconsin']
pomt-04314	Says Maggie Hassan pays zero property taxes on her $500,000 home.	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/oct/29/republican-governors-association/republican-governors-association-tv-ad-says-democr/	It has become the most recognizable building in the race for governor -- the colonial residence in Exeter, N.H. of Democratic candidate Maggie Hassan. Hassan’s abode was a topic whispered about by the campaign of her rival Ovide Lamontagne for months but it wasn’t until the Republican Governors Association released an ad three weeks before the Nov. 6 election that it became water-cooler conversation. "This is Maggie Hassan's half-million dollar home, a half-million dollar home that Hassan pays no property taxes on, zero property taxes," the narrator in the ad titled "Zero" declares. The ad goes on to charge that when Hassan was the majority leader of the state Senate "she pushed 33 tax and fee increases for the rest of us on top of our property taxes." "Maggie Hassan believes in higher taxes, just not for herself," the ad concludes. PolitFact New Hampshire decided to examine the accuracy of this claim that in the closing weeks of this tight race has sparked plenty of controversy, including several requests by PolitiFact readers to check the ad. The ad is part of the RGA's $5.8 million television advertising buy since the Sept. 11 primary, all spent on attacks against Hassan to benefit Republican Lamontagne. Since the day the ad was released Hassan said it was misleading because it fails to mention that she and her husband, Tom, don't own the home. They live in it because he's the principal of Phillips Exeter Academy, one of the country's most exclusive prep schools in the country. Hassan's camp maintains the ad tries to give the impression that she is a property tax scofflaw when in fact she's not. Five days after the RGA ad came out, the Hassan campaign came back with its own ad titled "Action," which opens with the same image of the home and explains the school ownership. Undeterred, the RGA through its Live Free PAC put up a second commercial titled "Hiding" with Hassan's home on it, and went back to the well. "Maggie Hassan admits she pays zero property taxes on her half-million dollar home," it declares. "Maggie Hassan pays no property taxes, but she likes high taxes for us." RGA Communications Director Michael Schrimpf said his group's researchers went through property assessment records in Exeter and found out the Hassans paid no property taxes. Phillips Exeter officials confirmed that Tom Hassan's contract requires that he live on campus in this home and that it be open and available for many school functions. The home is valued at $545,900 by the town and is one of the school’s tax-exempt properties. If someone was paying taxes on it, the bill would be about $12,350 a year. Private school property is tax-exempt on buildings used for instruction or administration. The Hassan residence qualifies under administration because the principal lives there. School officials listed the property on its tax-exempt application and the town approved. Phillips Exeter Director of Communications Julie Quinn said the private school is still the largest property taxpayer in town paying $772,946 a year on parcels that are not tax-exempt such as dining halls and dormitories. On top of claiming Hassan pays no property taxes, the RGA ad also declares Hassan likes taxing everybody else. As PolitiFact noted in a previous checkon a Lamontagne claim that Hassan was a big spender during her time in office from 2004-2010, total state spending went up by 20 percent during that period. But looking at funds spent from state taxes and fees, spending actually went down, since the Democrats twice reopened the budget to make cuts. It’s also true that when the 2010-11 state budget was out of balance, Gov. John Lynch and the Legislature, including Hassan, approved two bills that included revenue-raising taxes and fees that totaled more than $260 million. Our ruling: While it's true the Hassans pay no property taxes, it’s for good reason. She does not own the home she lives in. It’s owned by Phillips Exeter Academy where her husband Tom is principal and he is required to live in the home. The building is one of the school’s tax exempt properties, but Phillips Exeter is still the town’s largest taxpayer. The ad by the Republican Governor’s Association gives the impression that she's evading her own taxes while supporting increased taxes "for the rest of us." The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim to be Mostly False.

pomt-13930	Says Hillary Clinton’s "State Department blocked investigation into Orlando killer’s mosque."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/23/blog-posting/websites-say-hillary-clintons-state-department-blo/	The deadly nightclub attack in Orlando, Fla., has given rise to dozens of theories and explanations as to what happened and how it could have been stopped. One angle gaining traction in social media is that Hillary Clinton’s State Department enabled the attacker, U.S.-born Omar Mateen, 29, by blocking an investigation into a Florida mosque Mateen attended. Mateen killed 49 people and injured more than 50 in an Orlando nightclub June 12. The conspiracy-minded website InfoWars posted an article with the headline, "Hillary’s State Dept. Blocked Investigation into Orlando Killer’s Mosque" on Monday, June 13. Other websites, such as The Horn News, teased a story as "Hillary’s shocking link to Orlando massacre," while Conservative County said Clinton’s link to the Orlando shooter "has been exposed." Collectively, they have been shared at least thousands of times. Is there any truth to these claims? Not according to experts. The claim The InfoWars article centers on the Fort Pierce Islamic Center that Mateen attended. The article claims the mosque under investigation by the FBI and Department of Homeland Security in 2011, but that the investigation was shut down "under pressure from the Clinton-ran State Dept. and DHS’s Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Office out of fear of offending Muslims." The InfoWars story seems to be taken directly from another right-wing website World Net Daily. But that article paints a different picture of the investigation. Both articles are based on the account of Philip Haney, a former Homeland Security agent who says he was assigned to a unit that investigated individuals with potential links to terrorism. He wrote a book published in 2016 called See Something Say Nothing: A Homeland Security Officers Exposes the Government's Submission to Jihad. Haney described investigating an Islamic movement known as the Tablighi Jamaat (misspelled in the InfoWars article). That movement was connected to the Institute of Islamic Education, which is connected to the Darul Uloom Chicago madrassa, which has links to the Sharia Board of America. Haney said he found the Sharia Board of America also had links to the Fort Pierce Islamic Center. In other words, the 2011 investigation Haney described didn’t look directly into Mateen’s mosque, like the InfoWars headline makes it seem. This isn’t the first time Haney has made a connection like this. After the San Bernardino shootings, Haney made the same claim when speaking to Megyn Kelly on Fox News and in a column he wrote in The Hill in February. "The two San Bernardino jihadists, Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik, may have benefited from the administration’s closure of an investigation I initiated on numerous groups infiltrating radicalized individuals into this country," Haney wrote in an article on The Hill. We tried to reach Haney through his phone and also reached out to his book’s publishing company. He could not be reached in either attempt. The truth of the matter So that’s the story, and it relies almost entirely on one person’s account. One of the first holes in the InfoWars article is the misleading headline. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and an adjunct assistant professor in Georgetown University's security studies program, said the headline is wrong and noted InfoWars misinterpreted the information that was taken from World Net Daily. "It’s obviously wrong," Gartenstein-Ross said of the InfoWars headline. "Although, if (InfoWars) changed some words in the headline, it would match their source (World Net Daily). Then there’s a further question if it’s accurate or not." He said that the State Department could not block a case, but it’s possible it asserted pressure. Other experts we reached out to agreed that the InfoWars article doesn’t add up, or at least not in the specifics Haney mentions. The FBI has jurisdiction over domestic terrorism investigations, not Homeland Security, for which Haney worked, said Timothy Edgar, a senior fellow in international and public affairs at the Watson Institute. While Homeland Security does have a "relatively small" intelligence organization known as the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, Edgar said, the office has no jurisdiction to collect information or investigate cases. Point being, Haney likely wouldn’t be in a position at Homeland Security to investigate a terrorism case in the first place. Perhaps the bigger problem with the claim made in the article is the way it characterizes the State Department’s role in investigations. First, the FBI doesn’t investigate entire communities like a mosque, Edgar said. It investigates specific people suspected of terrorist activity. More importantly, the State Department "has no authority or involvement in decisions by the FBI to conduct or close investigations," Edgar said. "It is simply not credible to describe a mosque as being under ‘FBI and DHS’ investigation, or that this activity was halted by the State Department or by the DHS Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties," Edgar said. The State Department’s focus is on operations overseas, said Martin Reardon, who is the senior vice president of the Soufan Group and a 21-year veteran of the FBI. The secretary of state would have no say in domestic FBI cases, or even have an interest in activities inside the United States. Furthermore, FBI agents have to go through a number of channels before a case is closed. It’s not just shut down. And even then, agents are sometimes told to do more work to assure the investigation was done properly, Reardon said. Our ruling Articles claimed that Clinton as secretary of state enabled radical Islamists by shutting down an investigation of Mateen’s Florida mosque. The claim relies heavily on one account of a retired Department of Homeland Security agent that has not been corroborated by any additional source. Experts we talked to say the claims of the investigation and the purported link to Clinton and the State Department is unlikely. The FBI, not Haney’s Homeland Security department, would handle a terrorism investigation. The State Department, meanwhile, would play little to no role in whether a case is opened, closed or anything else. We rate this claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/686b3f34-b0bc-4551-9ae4-35394e6f9783	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2016-06-23T09:56:02	2016-06-13	['United_States_Department_of_State', 'Orlando,_Florida']
pomt-03358	Says "excise taxes are...disproportionately burdening middle- and lower-income consumers."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/jul/16/david-sutton/spokesman-takes-obama-cigarette-tax-idea/	President Barack Obama’s proposal to increase cigarette taxes to help fund pre-kindergarten programs is not getting good grades from some political and business leaders. A spokesman for Altria, the parent company of tobacco giant Philip Morris, offered a rationale for his opposition in a recent Atlanta Journal-Constitution article. His comments made us curious. "We think it is patently unfair to single out adult tobacco consumers with another federal tobacco tax increase to pay for a broad, new government spending program claimed to have benefits for everyone," said the spokesman, David Sutton. "Moreover, excise taxes are regressive, disproportionately burdening middle and lower-income consumers — the very same consumers who have already endured five years of a stagnant economy and high unemployment." It’s frequently said that excise taxes have a great impact on the poor. But as we’ve learned since the Truth-O-Meter started spinning here in 2010 that what’s often said isn’t always correct. We wondered whether Sutton is accurate to claim that excise taxes are "disproportionately burdening middle and lower-income consumers." Excise taxes are special taxes on the purchase of items such as gasoline, alcoholic beverages and tobacco products. They are usually fixed amounts per item, rather than percentages of the price. Obama has discussed raising federal taxes on cigarettes by nearly $1 a pack. By some estimates, approximately three of 10 low-income Americans are smokers. Some people, like New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, believe raising taxes on cigarettes can discourage smoking. Bloomberg made that argument in 2002 when he tried to increase taxes on cigarettes. "You raise it, consumption goes down," Bloomberg said, according to a citizen website that opposes what it called "smoker harassment." Most research we found showed the mayor is generally right, but consumption doesn’t decline as much as anti-smoking advocates would like. The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in one study that a 10 percent increase in cigarette prices is estimated to reduce overall consumption by 4 percent. Other studies say the ratio is more like a 1 percent decrease in consumption for every 1 percent increase in price. The CDC report says a larger percentage of low-income smokers quit once prices rise, but that those who decide to continue smoking are disproportionately impacted by increases in excise taxes. "Cigarette excise taxes increase the purchase price of cigarettes and can pose a disproportionate economic burden on lower socioeconomic populations," the report said. "However, because low-income groups are more responsive to price increases, increasing the real price of cigarettes can reduce cigarette consumption among low-income smokers by a greater percentage than among higher-income smokers." One group of researchers recently examined this issue in New York, breaking down the lowest income group as those with an annual salary of less than $30,000. The widely reported study, released in September, was funded by the New York State Department of Health. The researchers examined the changes from 2003-2004 to 2010-2011 as New York’s cigarette excise tax increased from $1.50 to $4.35. The percentage of income spent on cigarettes for all smokers nearly doubled, from 6.3 percent to 12 percent. For those classified as low-income, it doubled from 11.6 percent to 23.6 percent. "Someone making $20,000 or $30,000 who smokes a pack a day is going to spend a much higher proportion of their income than someone who makes a higher salary," said the lead researcher, Matthew Farrelly, chief scientist at RTI International, a nonpartisan, nonprofit research institute based in North Carolina. But Farrelly, who has written more than 80 research papers on tobacco use since 1998, said the impact for some low-income smokers can be "non-regressive, or progressive" when money from these tax increases goes to programs that help some smokers quit. Despite the tax increase, the study found that the percentage of low-income smokers who quit lighting up barely declined. But Farrelly said that may be because some smokers are circumventing the higher taxes by buying cigarettes illegally, online or in other states with lower excise taxes. He and his team noted that tax-paid cigarette sales captured only 55 percent of cigarettes sold in New York. We wondered whether the negative impact of the higher taxes on low-income smokers is overstated if many of them stop smoking. Farrelly said experts debate that question. He thinks there is still an impact. "(The higher taxes) alleviates some of the regressivity," Farrelly said, "but it doesn’t eliminate it." Across the Atlantic, when Germany increased its taxes on cigarettes in December 2004 and September 2005, approximately one of eight smokers went to a neighboring nation to buy their smokes at a cheaper price, a team of researchers found. To sum up, Sutton said excise taxes on cigarettes are "disproportionately burdening middle- and lower-income consumers." Numerous studies show Sutton’s claim is on target, but a larger percentage of them also quit smoking. Our rating: Mostly True.	None	David Sutton	None	None	None	2013-07-16T00:00:00	2013-06-30	['None']
pomt-07093	Multnomah County’s food action plan "clearly plans to disrupt the free market system in terms of food choices making it harder and more expensive for many residents to eat their food of choice."	pants on fire!	/oregon/statements/2011/jun/24/roxanne-ross/will-multnomah-countys-food-plan-make-it-harder-pe/	A tweet came to our attention recently, courtesy of the lively left-leaning and right-leaning twitterati who use the #orpol hashtag. ORLibertyGal tweeted: "Multnomah County plans to interfere with your food delivery. Oh goodie http://bit.ly/jFhTe5" Minutes later, BlueOregon contributor T.A. Barnhart responded: "onus on fearmongers to provide FACTS. | RT @ORlibertygal: MultCo plans to interfere w/food delivery. http://bit.ly/jFhTe5 #orpol #orleg" Facts? We love facts. Multnomah County wants to mess with food delivery? We better look into this. (Thanks Barnhart!) It turns out that the tweet stemmed from an online post at Red County, a website for conservative politicos. Gresham resident and Tea Party activist Roxanne Ross accused Multnomah County of using its 2009 food action plan "to artificially inflate the market" for organic local produce while dampening the availability of cheaper mass produced foods. The county,writes Ross, "clearly plans to disrupt the free market system in terms of food choices making it harder and more expensive for many residents to eat their food of choice." Some specifics cited by Ross (in our own words): Multnomah County wants to turn available space into farm plots, in order to feed more people within county lines. Multnomah County plans to disrupt restaurant food delivery service, by having retailers buy from local farmers. Multnomah County wants "communal kitchens" to encourage more use of local foods. Naturally, we had to study the plan for ourselves. We wondered if the county had visions of turning itself into a self-sustaining village with high taxes on out-of-county products. We turned to the Multnomah Food Action Plan 2025 and found that it’s not quite what Ross claims. The plan is aspirational and fuzzy, with backers saying it should lead to more collaboration and focus. From the document itself: "The 15-year action plan offers four action areas containing 16 goals and 65 communitywide collaborative actions for local government, businesses, nonprofit organizations, faith communities, and learning institutions. This Plan also offers 40 actions for individual community members whose daily choices or lack of choices in what to eat, where to shop, and how to become an advocate for change greatly influence our community." That’s a lot of partnerships and a lot of emphasis on individual choice. And frankly, it all sounds very pie-in-the-sky to PolitiFact Oregon. But we digress. Simply put, we bet that by 2025, shoppers will still be able to buy low-priced meats and potato chips from Fred Meyer. David Austin, spokesman for the county, agrees. He described the food plan as a promotional tool, a way to encourage residents and businesses to think of healthy food choices. (For example, sustainability staff just held its second "food summit" in June.) In 15 years, he said, as a result of the plan there might be healthier food choices in food-deprived neighborhoods currently served by convenience stores. Or, he said, there might be more community gardens with neighbors donating produce to the Oregon Food Bank. "Multnomah County is not going to put a sign on every corner and demand that no chips are sold here. At the same time, we want to make sure all of our residents have equal access to healthy food," he said. In an email, Ross said she’s not saying the county will halt importation of food. But she insists that the "market manipulations" cited in the plan, such as zoning for urban farms, will protect local foods, meaning that "for those people who prefer meat and food from outside the county, it will mean increased cost for food." Since we’re not economists, we decided to ask Portland State University environmental economics professor David Ervin how a fuzzy food plan could result in higher prices for meat and other foods from outside the county. He was puzzled. "Unless there’s regulations restricting the entry of food, of those foods she’s talking about, or there’s some additional costs imposed on those foods, then there’s not good economic logic on why their costs would go up," he said. "Those prices are set in national markets." Ervin explains that if more people choose to eat local food, that "will reduce the demand for those other imported foods, but I doubt that would have much of a price effect because we’re such a small part of the market." Just to make absolutely sure, we called the Cascade Policy Institute, a libertarian think tank that loves all things free market and hates government meddling. We got an earful from John Charles, the institute’s president and CEO, on both the meaninglessness of the plan, as well as its inconsistencies, and its poor writing. But the bottom line, he said, is that government already has the tools to encourage food choice: get rid of restrictive codes and high business taxes. "Assuming that eating locally grown food is desirable -- I don’t care whether people eat imported food, it is not a function of government to even care... ," he said. "... Assuming there’s some reason why local is good, we can accomplish that by relaxing some regulations, and giving producers and consumers the maximum choices." We asked Charles specifically whether the county’s plan would result in higher prices of meat and non-local foods. He said no. In the end, we don’t see how encouraging urban gardening and healthy eating and supporting a communal kitchen and small farmers will lead to higher prices for meat and bulk foods. There’s no disruption to the free flow of goods in and out of the market. In fact, those points -- price and disruption -- are ridiculous. We rate the claim Pants on Fire. Comment on this item.

pomt-05482	Every time the price of gasoline rises 1 cent, "it's a billion dollars out of our economy that goes to Saudi Arabia."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/apr/19/tommy-thompson/wisconsin-gop-senate-candidate-tommy-thompson-says/	In a March 23, 2012 campaign speech, Republican U.S. Senate candidate Tommy Thompson made a billion-dollar claim about a 1-cent increase in the price of gasoline. Addressing the La Crosse County Republican Party in western Wisconsin, the former Wisconsin governor called for the United States to become "energy independent," then said: "Every time, ladies and gentlemen, a penny goes up on that gasoline cost -- and how do you like those $4.25 a gallon? -- every time a penny goes up, it's a billion dollars out of our economy that goes to Saudi Arabia." That’s real money. Does cash really flow out of the country at that rate -- to a single oil-producing country -- from folks filling their gas tanks? When we asked the Thompson campaign for evidence, consultant Darrin Schmitz made two points in an email: 1. Thompson meant to say Middle East when he referred to Saudi Arabia. So, right off the bat, Thompson’s claim appears to be wrong. 2. A 50-cent increase in the price of gas costs U.S. consumers nearly $60 billion per year, according to a March 2012 article in The Atlantic magazine. The Atlantic article did say a 1-cent gas price increase would cost U.S. consumers $1.2 billion per year, which puts something of a time frame on Thompson’s statement. But that’s a different measure than $1 billion going from the U.S. economy to Saudi Arabia (or the Middle East, for that matter). We contacted four experts, each of whom used essentially the same math to evaluate Thompson’s Saudi Arabia claim. They agreed that a 1-cent increase in the price of a gallon of gas indicates that the price of a barrel of crude oil had risen 42 cents. Jay Hakes is the former director of the U.S. Energy Information Administration under President Bill Clinton and author of A Declaration of Energy Independence. He said that on average, the U.S. imported 1,195,000 barrels of Saudi petroleum per day in 2011, according to the Energy Information Administration. If each barrel cost 42 cents more, the U.S. would pay Saudi Arabia $501,900 more per day -- or slightly more than $183 million per year. That means it would take nearly 5 1/2 years for the U.S. to spend $1 billion more on Saudi oil. John Kingston is global director of news for the energy publication Platts. He multiplied 42 cents by a slightly different number -- 1,422,000 -- the net number of barrels per day imported from Saudi Arabia in January 2012, which is the most recent figure available. That comes to an additional cost of $597,240 per day, or nearly $218 million per year. So it would take 4-1/2 years to reach $1 billion. Jim Williams is an energy economist and owner of WTRG Economics in Arkansas. He took the same approach Kingston did. Charles Ebinger is director of the energy security initiative at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C. think tank. He said that for years, many people have claimed that a 1-cent increase in the gasoline tax would cost motorists $1 billion a year. He said that is roughly accurate, depending on how much gas motorists consume in a given year. Thompson didn’t mention a gas tax increase in his statement, but let’s take a look. Ebinger said that if a 1-cent increase in the cost of gas costs motorists $1 billion over one year, about $130 million of that money would go to Saudi Arabia, since about 13 percent of crude oil imports come from that country. At that rate, it would take nearly eight years for Saudi Arabia to collect an additional $1 billion from the United States. In any case, although Thompson singled it out, Saudi Arabia isn’t the largest provider of crude to the United States. The latest figures show that in January 2012, net oil imports from Canada were 2.66 million barrels per day, nearly double the 1.42 million barrels from Saudi Arabia, which ranked second. For all of 2011, Canada ranked first, Mexico second and Saudi Arabia third in the number of barrels imported per day. And the balance of U.S. imports and exports is improving. In 2011, U.S. exports of gasoline, diesel and other fuels exceeded imports for the first time since 1949, according to a claim rated True by PolitiFact New Jersey. The biggest contributing factor, however, was the increase in foreign purchases of distillate fuel, which includes diesel fuel and heating oil. Our rating Thompson said that every time the price of gasoline increases by 1 cent, "it's a billion out of our economy that goes to Saudi Arabia." His campaign said Thompson meant to say Middle East and cited a statistic that covers a one-year period. Four experts said it would take roughly four to eight years for a 1-cent increase in gas prices to result in an increase of $1 billion in what the U.S. spends to import Saudi oil. (Incidentally, we asked Williams, one of the experts, about the Middle East. He said it would take 3-1/2 years for $1 billion to flow from the U.S. to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Qatar and United Arab Emirates as a result of a penny increase in gas.

pomt-03671	Says businesses pay roughly 60 percent of taxes in Texas.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/apr/26/bill-hammond/business-group-leader-says-businesses-pay-roughly-/	As taxpayers faced the deadline for federal returns, Texas Gov. Rick Perry called for $1.6 billion in tax cuts for businesses in Texas. His proposal was "right and proper," business leader Bill Hammond said at Perry’s April 15, 2013, press conference, because "Texas businesses pay roughly 60 percent of all taxes that are paid in Texas today." PolitiFact Texas checked a similar statement in 2011, rating as Mostly True a state senator’s claim that businesses "pay most of the taxes" in Texas. Do businesses currently pay 60 percent? Hammond told us by phone that he intended his remark to encompass both state and local taxes. Generally, businesses in Texas shoulder a higher-than-average initial tax burden because the state is one of only nine with no income tax on individuals. Experts agree, though, that the burden eventually shifts to individuals as businesses raise prices, lower wages or send less profit to shareholders. In our 2011 fact-check, we looked at a report the Texas state comptroller publishes every two years predicting how much Texas will pull in from the state taxes that recently generated more than 2.5 percent of revenue. State law also requires the report to estimate how much will be paid in local school property taxes, although those are determined by and paid to individual districts, not the state. The report breaks out the (predicted initial) impact each tax has on businesses and consumers -- i.e., how much they pay. The latest report, published March 7, 2013, examined: Four taxes paid entirely by businesses -- franchise tax (the main tax on businesses’ revenues), natural gas tax, insurance premium tax and oil production tax. One tax paid entirely by consumers -- cigarette tax. Four taxes shared by the two groups -- sales tax, gasoline tax, motor vehicle sales tax and school property tax. Looking ahead to Texas’ fiscal year 2015 -- the 12 months ending Aug. 31, 2015 -- the comptroller predicted businesses would pay $37.2 billion (52 percent) with consumers paying $34.9 billion (48 percent). Comptroller’s spokesman R.J. DeSilva told us the eight state taxes in the report accounted for about 92 percent of state tax revenue in fiscal 2012. But there are other taxes Texas businesses pay, including city and county property taxes that, like school property taxes, don’t flow into state coffers. Dick Lavine, senior fiscal analyst with the liberal, Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, told us by email, "I hate to be making Hammond's case, but the bulk of the Comptroller's study includes only the major state taxes." Dale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association business group, said by email that the taxes left out of the comptroller’s report -- even if they’re only 8 percent of total revenue -- fall primarily on businesses. Examples he gave: taxes on "diesel, alcohol, tobacco excise (other than cigarettes), utility taxes, hotel taxes." Another major cost to businesses, Craymer said, is the state’s unemployment insurance tax -- money collected from employers under state law and redistributed by the Texas Workforce Commission as benefits to unemployed Texans. As in our earlier story, Hammond and Craymer each recommended a report -- "the most comprehensive comparative study," Craymer said -- done by consultants Ernst & Young for the Council on State Taxation, a Washington-based trade association representing corporate businesses. Spokesman Robert Wood at the Texas Association of Business, which Hammond heads, emailed us the council’s 2009 report on state and local tax burdens, which said that businesses paid nearly 61 percent of Texas taxes in the state’s fiscal 2008. A co-author of the report, Andrew Phillips at Ernst & Young, told us by email that according to their calculations, businesses paid about 60 percent of Texas taxes in fiscal 2009 and 61 percent in fiscal 2010 and 2011. Because those percentages were noticeably higher than our comptroller-based percentage, we drilled down into the results. Phillips pointed out several differences between the two estimates. As noted above, the comptroller was projecting ahead to 2015, whereas Ernst & Young was speaking to years in the recent past. He said Ernst & Young tabulated not just school property taxes but all local property taxes reported by the U.S. Census Bureau, adding up to a total $39 billion in fiscal 2011. Also, Ernst & Young included $2.4 billion in unemployment insurance tax paid by businesses in fiscal 2011, Phillips said. Hammond said, "The point is that businesses in Texas do pay, by any measure, more taxes than individuals and homeowners pay in Texas. ... We obviously believe that the Ernst & Young study is more correct for the last few years." Our ruling Hammond said businesses pay roughly 60 percent of the state’s tax bill. By our calculations using state projections that do not take into account all taxes, businesses will pay 52 percent of taxes in the state in 2015. In contrast, Hammond’s source, a national group representing corporations, calculates that businesses paid 61 percent of all taxes in Texas in fiscal 2011. So, estimates vary because different taxes are considered. Keeping in mind, too, that businesses offload many expenses including taxes, we rate Hammond’s claim as Mostly True.

pomt-11147	"I’m in prison for practicing politics."	pants on fire!	/illinois/statements/2018/may/29/rod-blagojevich/blago-op-ed-falsely-claims-he-prison-practicing-po/	There’s little need to rehash the saga of Rod Blagojevich, Illinois’ 40th governor and the only one ever impeached. For the last six years he has been locked up in a federal prison in Littleton, Colorado, serving a 14-year sentence for convictions on an array of corruption charges, including a spectacularly brazen attempt to sell his power as governor to fill the U.S. Senate seat left vacant by the ascension of Barack Obama to the presidency. Blagojevich has exhausted all appeals through the courts to get his conviction overturned or the sentence reduced. Lately, his family and some diehard supporters have made noises about seeking a pardon from President Donald Trump, who once featured Blagojevich on his Celebrity Apprentice TV show and who, judging by his tweets, has his own beef with aggressive prosecutors. Against that backdrop, federal prisoner number 40892-424 this week penned a column in the conservative opinion pages of The Wall Street Journal, owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch who is tight with Trump. Murdoch also owns the conservative Fox News Channel, which the president is known to binge watch. Blagojevich framed his column as a cautionary tale to other politicians, warning that he had been hounded unfairly by an out-of-control Justice Department "abusing their power to criminalize the routine practices of politics and government." "I’m in Prison for Practicing Politics," the headline on his opinion article declared. All of which raises some provocative questions. Is Blagojevich really the victim here, as he clearly suggests? And was he sent to prison for merely doing the same things other politicians and government officials routinely do? The tragicomic governor First, a note of explanation. The authors of this fact-check have more than a passing knowledge of Blagojevich. One covered every moment of both his federal corruption trials as a reporter for The Chicago Tribune, the other also as a Tribune reporter covered the federal investigation that led to Blagojevich’s indictment and later co-authored a book chronicling his political rise and fall. The portrait that emerged from that up-close observation was of a leader sublimely self-righteous, comically vain, untrustworthy, uninterested in the process of governing, unsophisticated in the arts of policy and deal making and not particularly discriminating in whose counsel he sought. As governor, he waged a bitter public battle with his father-in-law, who had been his political mentor. Another top adviser and fundraiser went to prison in corruption schemes that served as a precursor to Blagojevich’s own indictment. Another top fundraiser committed suicide after pleading guilty to federal charges in a kickback scheme. On the day he was sentenced in December 2011, Blagojevich fell on his sword before U.S. District Judge James Zagel, appearing to own his misdeeds in a plea for mercy that did not work. "My life is ruined," he told Zagel. "I have nobody to blame but myself for my stupidity and actions and words and what I thought I could do. I’m not blaming anybody." But in his Wall Street Journal article, Blagojevich made clear that he was no longer blaming himself as he accused prosecutors and the FBI of abusing their powers to bring him down. "Here I am in my sixth year of a 14-year prison sentence for the routine practice of attempting to raise campaign funds while governor," he wrote. Blagojevich’s legal team raised that defense at trial, but jurors rejected it. Acting on a tip from a longtime Blagojevich confidant, government agents received court approval to wiretap phones in the governor’s home and political office. It was evidence gathered from those wiretaps, much of it from Blagojevich’s own mouth, that served as the centerpiece of the case against him. Over two separate trials, Blagojevich was convicted on 18 criminal counts including wire fraud, bribery, attempted extortion, conspiracy and lying to the FBI. Five of those counts were later tossed on appeal, but the crimes for which he still stands convicted include: Trying to shake down the CEO of Children’s Memorial Hospital for $25,000 in campaign cash in exchange for a hike in state reimbursements for pediatric specialists. Withholding approval of legislation to help the horseracing industry until a track owner came up with a $100,000 political donation. Dangling the Senate appointment as bait to gain campaign cash for his political operation or a new and more lucrative job for himself inside or outside of government. Among wiretaps played at trial were some that captured Blagojevich discussing a scheme to appoint a longtime political adversary to the post, then U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., in exchange for $1.5 million in political donations. Prosecutors said they arrested Blagojevich in December 2008 to prevent him from pulling the trigger on that deal. Our ruling "I’m in prison for practicing politics," read the headline on the article by the former Illinois governor. Blagojevich and his legal team also made the "politics as usual, nothing to see here" argument during his trials, but such claims were soundly rejected by federal jurors. Over two trials, they convicted him of multiple criminal counts stemming from his conduct in office. Much of the evidence presented at those trials stemmed from court-ordered wiretaps on which Blagojevich was heard scheming to carry out the very crimes for which he was convicted. Blagojevich was contrite about his actions at his sentencing, appearing to own up to misdeeds. Now, in playing the victim card, he is attempting to take that all back. But Blagojevich’s own words and deeds proved his undoing. Illinois has certainly suffered its share of public corruption, and skepticism about politicians abounds. But Blagojevich’s "everybody does it" argument seems an over-the-top exercise in desperation and self-pity. We give his claims our lowest credibility rating, Pants On Fire!

pomt-02900	Says Barack Obama "knew half of the population of the United States would lose their health insurance."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/06/glenn-beck/beck-says-obama-knew-50-americans-would-lose-healt/	The attacks continue against President Barack Obama for saying "if you like your plan, you can keep your plan." Latest up: Conservative radio talk show host Glenn Beck, who claims Obama knew what was going to happen all along. "They had the studies that showed that up to 80 million people would lose their health insurance," Beck said Monday on his radio show, which is syndicated on more than 400 stations. "Now we find out this week that number is actually 125 million. Half of the population in the United States, they knew half of the population of the United States would lose their doctor and their health insurance? "And yet he went on the road over and over and over and over and over and over again and said, ‘You'll be able to keep your doctor if you like him, you’ll be able to keep your health insurance,’ when they knew half of the population the United States would lose their health insurance." That’s a hefty claim. Not only is Beck saying half of all Americans will lose their health insurance because of the health care law, but that Obama knew about it in advance. (Fox News had a more limited version of this claim with millions of Americans losing coverage.) The Glenn Beck Show told us that the claim came from an article in the Daily Caller, a conservative news website.The item cites the work of Christopher Conover, a scholar at the Center for Health Policy and Inequalities Research at Duke University and an adjunct scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. (The American Enterprise Institute and its scholars have generally been critical of the health care law.) Conover, in his work, looks ahead to the end of 2014 and makes a few predictions. "Of the 189 million Americans with private health insurance coverage, I estimate that if Obamacare is fully implemented, at least 129 million (68 percent) will not be able to keep their previous health care plan," Conover said. That’s where Beck gets his 125 million figure, which for the record, is about 40 percent of the population of the United States, not 50 percent. Conover continues, "But of these (129 million), ‘only’ 18 to 50 million will literally lose coverage, i.e., have their plans entirely taken away. ... The rest will retain their old plans but have to pay higher rates for Obamacare-mandated bells and whistles." Whether you believe Conover or not is irrelevant when considering Beck’s claim. Conover says 18 million to 50 million people will lose coverage -- Beck said 125 million, a gross exaggeration. But that’s only one issue. Conover himself takes issue with Beck’s use of his estimate. "In my view, ‘lose their health insurance’ without any further qualification has a different connotation than ‘not be able to keep their previous health plan’," he told PunditFact. "Absent any further explanation, many might interpret ‘losing’ health coverage as becoming uninsured." What they did know So Beck’s claim is obviously wrong as to the number. But he also indicated Obama knew that millions of people would lose their health insurance. What evidence is there of that? It is not as though the White House was unaware that the Affordable Care Act would change business as usual, in both the individual and group health insurance markets. (The individual market is where people buy insurance on their own; the group market is when an employer does the buying and tells workers what their options are.) An NBC report cited four administration sources who said that early on, they expected that up to three-quarters of people in the individual market would get cancellation notices. And back in 2010, analysts from three federal departments, Labor, Health and Human Services and the Internal Revenue Service, looked at the number of employer-based plans that would change to the point that they would lose their grandfathered status. But that study did not try to account for a very common situation -- plans that changed, but already met the new health care law’s standards. According to a 2013 survey by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans, about three-quarters of all employer-sponsored health plans already meet the criteria of the Affordable Care Act. In other words, employers plans may have changed, but it’s not directly and unilaterally attributable to the health care law. Beck’s staff offered a narrower view -- that any plan that changes means you have lost your insurance. If so, then many employees have been losing their insurance every year as plans change, premiums increase, or co-pays swing one way or the other. Conover said part of the point of his analysis is that plans will change but coverage would remain. The best way to describe his analysis, he said: "Half of those with private insurance would be unable to keep their pre-ACA plans." Other experts PunditFact spoke with agreed that there’s a big difference between losing your health insurance and seeing your plan change. "It does not mean that someone is losing their insurance plan," said Jonathan Oberlander, professor of health policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. "The situation is different in the individual market, where plans (many of which offer limited coverage) are being canceled by insurers. But the individual market only represents about 5 percent of the country." Scott Harrington, professor of health care management at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, was equally emphatic. "Losing grandfathered status does not mean that you lose your health insurance," Harrington said. Our ruling Beck said that when Obama promised that people could keep the plans they like, he knew that half of all Americans would lose their health insurance. Beck is wrong in every respect. The primary study he relied on contradicts his number, saying that at most 50 million people would lose coverage, not 125 million. Beck’s staff said they believe that any change in a plan means you have lost your health insurance. Not even the author of the study Beck cites agrees with that, nor do the other health policy experts we consulted. On top of that, the government estimate of the number of plans that would be fully exposed to the new insurance requirements actually says little about the law’s impact. The law’s requirements would only matter for plans that did not measure up; many of them already did. Lastly, there is no evidence that Obama knew or believed that a calamity of this magnitude was in store. The claim needs a checkup. We rate it Pants on Fire.

pomt-08747	"The federal government is now on track" for the second-largest budget deficit "in 65 years."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/30/glenn-beck/beck-claims-us-track-second-biggest-deficit-65-yea/	Vice President Joe Biden talks a lot about the success of the government's economic policies, but not everybody is persuaded. Reacting to Biden's Aug. 24, 2010, statement that "we are turning this great ship of state around," TV host Glenn Beck pointed to the country's dire fiscal situation. "Remember, Joe Biden says no doubt we're headed in the right direction on the economy. Well, we're just getting started with the news of the day. How about this one? Unemployment 9.6 percent. The real unemployment number is 16.5 for July. The federal government is now on track for the second-largest budget shortfall in 65 years, 9.1 of GDP. And in 31 months, Congress has added $4.4 trillion to the 10-year spending baseline. Who's going to lend us more money?" Beck said on his Aug. 25, 2010, show. In this item, we'll focus on the claim that the federal government "is now on track for the second-largest budget shortfall in 65 years." We turned to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the official scorekeeper for Congress. Its most recent estimates, published in August 2010, indicate that in 2010, the federal deficit will exceed $1.3 trillion. As a percentage of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product -- the value of the goods and services that the economy produces -- that's 9.1 percent, as Beck said. How does that compare with previous years? We checked data going back to 1930 from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), a government agency that helps prepare the president's annual budget. Only in 2009 and in the war years 1942, 1943, 1944 and 1945 was the deficit-to-GDP ratio higher than 9.1 percent, according to the OMB. But going back 65 years only takes you to 1946, so that would put 2010 on track to be the second-highest, according to CBO's figures. The CBO and the OMB have slightly different projections for the 2010 deficit, with the CBO's being the more recent. The discrepancy arises from differences in the agencies' projections of future economic conditions and the impact of legislation enacted after the OMB completed its estimates. OMB projected in July that the 2010 deficit will be 10.6 percent of GDP. That would make it the biggest in 65 years -- not the second biggest. But looking back 65 years and using the CBO's estimate, as Beck did, the deficit was higher as a percentage of GDP only in 2009, when it stood at 9.9 percent. We thought it would be valuable to explore the reasons behind the current deficit as well as the projected deficits over the next decade. We spoke to a number of economists and found that they offer different explanations. Brian Riedl, a budget analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told us via e-mail that the main drivers of today's deficit are the ongoing economic downturn, which has reduced government revenues, and the policies that the government has enacted in response to the crisis. "Recession automatically reduces revenues and increases unemployment and antipoverty spending, even if Congress does nothing. At the same time, we have enacted $1 trillion in stimulus spending, plus TARP, Fannie/Freddie bailouts, and large discretionary spending hikes. So enacted policies are certainly a contributor," Riedl wrote. The CBO provided a similar explanation. "This year’s deficit is attributable in large part to a combination of weak revenues and elevated spending associated with the economic downturn and the policies implemented in response to it." Speaking about future projections, Riedl wrote that future deficits are likely to remain well over a trillion due to "runaway government spending." Kathy Ruffing, a senior policy analyst at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, emphasized that even before President Barack Obama took office, the CBO had already projected that the 2009 deficit would exceed $1 trillion. The 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan accounted for over $500 billion of that, she wrote on June 28, 2010. Riedl, however, disagrees. "Both recent and future budget deficits have been blamed largely on the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, and to a lesser extent on the war on terrorism, but the data contradict these myths. In reality, spending is almost exclusively the problem," he wrote in a June 2010 report. Finally, Chris Dreibelbis, the outreach and public liaison for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan Washington, D.C., think tank, pointed to the recession and the policy responses to it as the "main culprits" in the current deficit. "Going forward, the structural problems that were there before the recession will combine with the growth in spending from an aging population and health care costs, to cause large and ongoing deficits even once the economy recovers," he wrote us in an e-mail. So let's review. Beck said that we're on track to have the second-biggest budget deficit in 65 years. According to the Congressional Budget Office, he's right. Going by the administration's own estimate, the situation is even more dire. We found disagreement among economists as to why the deficits are soaring, but Beck's point stands, so we rate this True.

pomt-06463	"(Sen. Robert) Gordon cost us money, exempting the Newark sports arena from paying property taxes and sticking us with the bill."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/oct/19/john-driscoll/property-taxes-newarks-prudential-center-become-is/	The Prudential Center in Newark is not in his legislative district or even one of the counties he's looking to represent in Trenton, but Republican State Senate candidate John Driscoll Jr. wants voters in parts of Bergen and Passaic counties to know the arena doesn’t pay property taxes. For that exemption, Driscoll says voters can blame his opponent in the Nov. 8 general election, Democratic incumbent Robert Gordon. Looking to unseat Gordon in the 38th Legislative District, Driscoll, a Bergen County freeholder, recently put out a television ad lambasting the senator for allegedly raising taxes and chasing away jobs from Bergen County. With cash flying from the image of a family superimposed over a photo of the Prudential Center, the narrator intones: "Gordon cost us money, exempting the Newark sports arena from paying property taxes and sticking us with the bill." PolitiFact New Jersey found that Gordon did vote in 2008 to exempt the Newark Housing Authority, which owns the arena, from paying property taxes there. But that property tax exemption did not have a direct effect on voters in Bergen and Passaic counties, who are the target audience for the ad. First, let’s explain the property tax exemption. Gordon was one of 21 senators -- the minimum needed for passage -- to vote for a bill in 2008 exempting projects like the Prudential Center from paying property taxes. The bill was later signed into law by former Gov. Jon Corzine. Without such an exemption, the authority would have had to pay $6 million in property taxes to the city, authority attorney Paul Sangillo said at the time. So, Driscoll’s ad is right that Gordon supported an exemption for the Prudential Center, which means the city does not receive property tax revenues from the arena property. Otherwise, those tax revenues would go to the city, its school district and Essex County. In a statement, Newark spokeswoman Anne Torres said the tax exemption is appropriate, because the arena property is publicly owned. The authority collects rent at the arena on behalf of the city, Torres said. "If the property were not exempt, the NHA would likely have to expend federal or state funding or in other words ‘tax dollars’ to afford the taxes on the property," according to the statement. "Without revisiting the original ownership structure, the exemption from that view potentially saved tax dollars." Former New Jersey Deputy Attorney General Robert Blau, who has an extensive background in real estate matters, also noted the impact of other tax revenue, such as sales taxes: "There are certainly other taxes that Newark gets because of the existence of the center. It’s not just lost property taxes." OK, so Newark is not receiving property taxes from the arena property, but the ad claims the exemption "cost us money." Who is "us?" Driscoll spokesman Greg Volpe said "us" refers to taxpayers, and pointed to news articles showing that Newark has needed additional state aid both before and after that exemption was granted. "The special exemption for (the) Newark Arena cost the city's bottom line millions of dollars in recurring revenue," Volpe said in an email. "State Legislators were wrong to exempt one of Newark's revenue assets and the result is state taxpayers, including those in the 38th District, have continued to pick up the bill." But the ad doesn’t mention those additional state aid awards, giving viewers the impression that "bill" refers to the property tax exemption alone. The absence of those property tax payments only has a direct impact on Newark, its school district and Essex County. "I’m not aware of any rationale by which it could be said that a Newark local property tax exemption could be said to impact taxpayers outside of Essex County," Joseph Ragno, an attorney with extensive experience in tax abatements, said in an email. Our ruling In a TV ad, Driscoll claims Gordon cost taxpayers money by "exempting the Newark sports arena from paying property taxes and sticking us with the bill." Gordon did support that exemption, and news articles show that Newark has needed additional state aid dollars over the years. But the ad ties the "bill" to the property tax exemption, and the only entities directly affected are the city, the school district and the county -- not those voters in Bergen and Passaic counties.

pomt-03657	"Despite having their budget increased by over 40 percent since 2009 … pending claims for benefits with the (Department of Veterans Affairs) have increased from 391,000 to 890,000 under the Obama Administration."	true	/georgia/statements/2013/apr/30/tom-graves/backlog-veterans-benefits-draws-scrutiny/	More than a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan may have wound down, but policymakers warn the fight has just begun for some veterans. They say these warriors’ newest foe is a homegrown threat: bureaucracy at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. A backlog of disability claims has forced a growing number of veterans suffering from head trauma, post-traumatic stress disorder and other ailments to wait for months and sometimes more than a year for word of whether the federal government will help them. Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Graves of Ranger called the backlog "immoral" in a recent op-ed, and he used a stream of factoids to demonstrate how bad the problem has gotten. These figures piqued our interest: "Despite having their budget increased by over 40 percent since 2009 … pending claims for benefits with the VA have increased from 391,000 to 890,000 under the Obama Administration," he said on ZPolitics, a website launched by talk radio host and former congressional candidate Martha Zoller. If Graves is correct, the number of pending claims has grown by more than 125 percent. Is this true? And was the agency’s budget hike really this steep, despite the budget-cutting debates of recent years? We contacted Graves spokesman John Donnelly for more information. The congressman’s criticism is part of a growing chorus of complaints that the VA takes too long to tell veterans whether they’ll receive disability assistance. News stories have chronicled cases where veterans died as they waited for an answer. Lawmakers are clamoring for action, and VA Secretary Eric Shinseki has vowed to eliminate the backlog by 2015. Donnelly responded to PolitiFact Georgia’s request for more information with the VA’s own figures. First, let’s look at the VA’s budget. A 10-year overview published on its website showed that in fiscal year 2009, it totaled $97.7 billion. Now it’s $140.3 billion. That’s a 43.6 jump, or as Graves said, an increase of "over 40 percent." Now, let’s consider disability claims. Although the controversy centers on backlogged claims -- defined as those pending more than 125 days -- Graves’ statement concerns "pending" claims, those awaiting a disability rating decision by the VA. Graves wants veterans to have to wait no more than 30 days for a decision. For this portion of our fact check, Donnelly referred us to the VA’s weekly disability claims reports. On Jan. 21, 2009, one day after Obama was sworn into office, the department released a report that said the number of pending cases totaled 391,127. The April 8, 2013, report was the most recent one available when Graves submitted his op-ed to ZPolitics, Donnelly said. We found it reported 889,981 pending claims. Sure enough, Graves used accurate figures. But did he put them in the correct context? Although Graves did not accuse Obama of causing the growth in pending claims, he did mention that the increase took place under the president’s watch. This suggests that the current administration bears at least some responsibility for the problem. We looked to see whether it does. We found that the backlog has been a long time coming. The benefits system had been outdated for years before Obama took office. When Shinseki, an Obama appointee, took over the department in 2009, it used paper files, not electronic ones. It did not have enough staff to handle the onslaught of veterans returning from a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan. "I don't think we really anticipated the nature of injuries, the multiple deployments. Men and women are surviving injuries that would have been sure death 20 or 25 years ago," said Dave Autry, a spokesman with DAV, an organization that advocates for disabled American veterans. The VA hired more staff and in fiscal 2011 completed 1 million claims, a 6 percent increase from 2009, according to the Government Accountability Office. But the number of claims received grew 29 percent, the GAO reported. Veterans advocates told us that even though the VA increased staff, training fell short and claims administrators made bad decisions. Veterans appealed, and the backlog grew even larger. A computerized system intended to streamline the process is still being implemented. What’s worse is that to prove they are disabled, veterans have to pull together documents from the Social Security Administration, the Department of Defense and other federal bureaucracies that do not share information, said Paul Rieckhoff, who heads Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, which has been pushing for improvement. "What you see is really a bureaucratic failure that stretches across the government," Rieckhoff said. "We don't think it's been a partisan issue." In sum, Graves’ numbers are correct. The VA’s budget has increased by more than 40 percent, and the number of pending claims has skyrocketed from some 391,000 to 890,000 under the Obama administration. Graves also was accurate in noting that the increase took place under the president’s watch. While the VA’s benefits system has been troubled since well before Obama took office, efforts during his administration have not prepared the department for its current challenges. We rate Graves’ statement True.	None	Tom Graves	None	None	None	2013-04-30T08:12:41	2013-04-23	['None']
pomt-06776	The results of Atlanta Public School’s 2010 and 2011 CRCT tests "have not been questioned."	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2011/aug/19/beverly-hall/former-atlanta-schools-cheif-halls-says-recent-sco/	Former Atlanta schools chief Beverly Hall is defending her reputation in a national education publication. Investigators released a report in July that found soaring scores on the Criterion-Referenced Competency Tests that made Hall an education star were the result of widespread cheating. Critics have called her a crook and a liar. Some want her to return more than a half-million dollars in bonuses. Others want her behind bars. So when the trade publication Education Week ran a commentary by Hall on Aug. 10, PolitiFact Georgia took notice. What could she possibly say to clear her name? Hall’s piece, "The Scandal Is Not the Whole Story," argued that because the district improved test security in 2010 and 2011, cheating did not taint all of APS’ gains. "The results of the standardized tests administered in 2010 and 2011 under this enhanced security have not been questioned -- and most important of all -- the dramatic improvement in test scores has remained," Hall wrote. The 2010 and 2011 results "have not been questioned"? We reached for our Truth-O-Meter. Before we launch into our analysis, we need to make two points. The first is that this story will not address whether APS tests scores registered "dramatic improvement." We’ll leave that question for another time. More importantly, when Hall got wind of our story, she decided to revise the sentence we are checking. Now it reads "the results of the standardized tests administered in 2010 and 2011 under this enhanced security indicate that dramatic improvement in test scores has remained." Since her unrevised statement was online for more than a week, we think it’s still fair game to check it. Now on to Hall’s statement. We asked Hall’s lawyer for proof, but he did not respond. Fortunately, we had plenty of other sources. One was the Governor’s Office of Student Achievement, which launched a statewide analysis of 2009 CRCT tests the same year a probe by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution found improbable gains in test scores. At two schools, the odds of making such leaps were less than 1 in a billion. GOSA Executive Director Kathleen Mathers said Hall is wrong about 2010’s results. GOSA flagged 16 Atlanta elementary and middle schools for possible cheating on that year’s test. This means that 11 percent or more of their classrooms showed high numbers of wrong-to-right erasures, which is a sign of possible cheating. Thirteen of these schools had already been flagged for their 2009 scores. Mathers also referred us to the state investigation that found widespread APS corruption. It uncovered even more evidence of testing impropriety or outright cheating on the 2010 CRCT. Here are some examples: *Parks Middle School: A teacher saw evidence that a paraprofessional gave the school’s principal a testing booklet that he was not supposed to have. When she reported the incident, the principal pressured her to change her story. * Dunbar Elementary: One teacher found what he thought to be math formula cheat sheets on every student’s desk during math CRCT testing. He also discovered that students had their social studies books out before the social studies CRCT tests. * D.H. Stanton Elementary: Teachers said they think cheating occurred because the school’s testing coordinator allowed teachers who were friends to administer the test to each other’s students. Some had a reputation for cheating. * Dobbs Elementary: A student told a teacher that the person who administered their CRCT gave them test answers. * Bethune Elementary: A teacher said that the principal allowed students who live out of zone to stay at the school if they had good scores. So much for Hall’s claim about the 2010 CRCTs. What about the 2011 tests? GOSA has not yet performed its statewide erasure analysis on these newest APS scores, and the special investigation did not address 2011. The AJC did publish its own analysis July 28. Five schools registered unlikely increases in their CRCT test scores this year. Three of them -- Toomer, White and West Manor elementary schools -- had also been named in the special investigator’s report for 2009 cheating. West Manor and White were also flagged in 2010. The odds of such increases range from about one in 700 to one in 21,000, according to the AJC analysis -- not as unlikely as gains in prior years, but still statistically unusual. School supporters say teaching methods or changing enrollment were behind the increases, but APS’ interim Superintendent Errol Davis and Mathers said they may deserve further scrutiny. Hall’s claim is clearly incorrect. So how do we rule? Hall submitted her commentary to Education Week on Aug. 9, according to its opinion editor. This is days after the AJC released its findings on the 2011 scores and more than a month after special investigators released their report. She had more than enough time to figure out that GOSA, special investigators and the AJC have questioned her results. Hall’s pants are more than singed. They’re blazing. She earns our lowest rating on this one. Pants on Fire.	None	Beverly Hall	None	None	None	2011-08-19T06:00:00	2011-08-10	['None']
pomt-04874	In June 2012 "we actually had more people go on Social Security Disability [85,000] ... than the 80,000 jobs that were created."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/aug/09/allen-west/us-rep-allen-west-d-fla-says-number-people-who-wen/	U.S. Rep. Allen West, a Florida Republican, was in Rhode Island last weekend on a fundraising trip. During a radio interview Aug. 1 on WHJJ’s "The Helen Glover Show," Glover turned the conversation toward a topic West has talked about often in recent months: the correlation between the number of people exhausting their unemployment benefits and new recipients of Social Security Disability benefits. "It’s unconscionable to think that in the month of June, the federal government [reported] 80,000 new jobs created but the little fact that no one is talking about is that we have 85,000 people go on Social Security Disability the same month." Said West: "So we actually had more people go on Social Security Disability -- which is different from Social Security -- than the 80,000 jobs that were created." "What we are doing is just making more people economically dependent on government," said West, "instead of having the right economic policies to make people economically free." West, a first-term congressman, is known for making provocative remarks. In April 2012 he garnered headlines when he said "about 78 to 81 members of the Democratic Party" were communists -- a reference, he said, to the liberal-leaning Congressional Progressive Caucus, which the Communist Party has publicly referred to as its ally. PolitiFact Florida gave that statement a Pants on Fire rating, saying West was using a guilt-by-association rationale and had failed to prove that any member of Congress was a communist. We wondered whether he was on more solid ground in his claim about Social Security Disability. We asked his office for his backup, but they never responded. Then we began our own research. We discovered that West got his numbers right. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 80,000 new jobs were created in June. And the Social Security Administration reported that 84,766 people were new beneficiaries of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) that same month. (Since January, employment growth has averaged about 151,000 new jobs a month, the labor bureau reports. Over that same period, an average of 82,560 people per month went on SSDI.) SSDI is a federal program funded by workers’ payroll taxes, just like Social Security retirement. To be eligible, workers must qualify as physically or mentally disabled and must have also paid some of those Social Security taxes during their employment. Stephen C. Goss, chief actuary of the Social Security Administration, has said that in every recession since the 1970s, the number of people applying for Social Security Disability has increased as their unemployment benefits expire. In a talk in April before the National Academy of Social Insurance, in Washington, D.C., Goss explained the trend as a "temporary phenomenon for a cyclic economic downturn." "The [current] recession resulted in a lot of people becoming unemployed ... and when people become unemployed they seek a way of continuing to have income. And people who can qualify for our disabled worker benefits, of course, go ahead and apply. So we did have an increase in the number of applications." David H. Autor, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has served on the President’s Council on Economic Advisers, said in an e-mail: "I do not see this as a political issue." It is well-known that "when economic times are bad, many more people turn to SSDI out of desperation.... "The growth of SSDI is a long-standing problem and the recession has made it worse," Autor said. "The comparison between the two numbers (SSDI awards and jobs) is depressing." By the end of last year, more than 8.5 million Americans were receiving SSDI, roughly 1 million more than when the Great Recession began in December 2007, according to the Social Security Administration. Included in that figure were 35,905 disabled workers in Rhode Island receiving on average $1,115 a month, not counting the smaller state supplement they also receive. That growth is expected to continue; several studies have predicted that SSDI could run out of money by 2018. The Obama administration referred to the program’s costs when it argued for extending unemployment benefits last fall, saying in a December 2011 report: "workers on SSDI rarely return to the labor force, resulting in a loss to society of the economic contribution those workers could have made. Thus, keeping the long-term unemployed in the labor force should be a priority." Our ruling Rep. Allen West said that the number of people who became recipients of Social Security Disability in June (85,000) was higher than the number of jobs created that month (80,000). West quoted the numbers accurately. We rate his statement True.	None	Allen West	None	None	None	2012-08-09T00:01:00	2012-08-01	['None']
pomt-05669	"While 9,000 state employees were added to the state’s payroll, Oregon’s revenue forecasts dropped by more than $4 billion."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2012/mar/16/dennis-richardson/did-oregon-add-9000-state-workers-while-revenue-dr/	PolitiFact Oregon enjoys receiving the newsletters of Rep. Dennis Richardson, R-Central Point. He’s written about China, federal timber reimbursements, and most usually, state spending. He is co-chairman with Rep. Peter Buckley, D-Ashland, of the House side of the Joint Ways and Means Committee. Richardson’s newsletters often include statements worthy of a fact check, such as this one about state workers receiving a catch-up raise in 1981. (Inflation was so high then it wasn’t really a catch-up.) A recent newsletter made us wonder, once again, about the size of state government: "The rising costs of state payroll expenses must be brought in line with the state’s revenue resources. According to Public Employment Retirement System (PERS) records, in 2006 Oregon had 38,000 employees and by 2011 the number of employees had increased to 47,000," he wrote. "Oregon finds itself in a conundrum. While 9,000 state employees were added to the state’s payroll, Oregon’s revenue forecasts dropped by more than $4 billion." Numbers. Drool. Are those employee figures correct? Did the revenue forecast really drop by $4 billion? And, most importantly, is it fair to juxtapose the two? Richardson said in a voicemail left at PolitiFact Oregon Central that Democrats built a government that we can no longer afford. "They expand government because their philosophy is that government can help more people," he said. "Mine is that that may be true, but you run out of money after a while." In his newsletter, Richardson cited the Public Employees Retirement System, which produces a report every year that lists the number of employees for public employers in Oregon. Richardson correctly cites the numbers attributed to the State of Oregon. But we decided to go further, because we’ve always been puzzled by the number of workers in state government. We pulled figures from the retirement system, and also from the Department of Administrative Services, which handles the executive branch of state government, and the Oregon University System. We tried to get the best apples-to-apples comparison, asking the agencies to weed out temporary workers and to focus on people eligible for retirement. We came up with a very odd table. Agency 2005-06 2006-07 2007-08 2008-09 2009-10 2010-11 % inc. DAS 30,849 31,046 32,383 32,994 33,795 33,124 7 OUS 13,460 13,590 13,807 14,234 13,720 15,136 12 Total 44,309 44,636 46,190 47,228 47,515 48,260 9 PERS 37,973 42,906 41,872 44,377 46,105 46,739 23 See the problem? If you add the executive branch and higher education numbers, the number of employees increased 9 percent, or nearly 4,000 people from fiscal year 2006 to 2011. If you look at the retirement system figures, it increased 23 percent, or by 8,800 people. Also, note that the 2005-06 retirement system number is much lower than that provided by the executive department and university system. Part of the reason for the discrepancy, says PERS spokesman David Crosley, is because university employees can opt for another retirement plan. Otherwise, he said the agency could not not explain the difference in growth. Let’s turn to the revenue shortfall. Richardson is correct that the revenue that the state estimated it would bring in dropped by $4 billion in that time, from $19.2 billion in March 2008 to $14.8 billion today. But we also want to point out that for all of 2007 and much of 2008, the forecast hovered around $19 billion. The forecast released in November 2008 was the first to show a drop, and then revenue tumbled from bad to worse. The executive branch went up, then down, in hiring from mid-2008 to mid-2011, with an overall growth of 0.3 percent. The real increase was in the number of university employees over the same period, 6 percent growth. Why? Well, when jobs are scarce, more students go to school. And when more students enroll, colleges and universities need more people to teach. That 6 percent growth in hiring corresponded with an enrollment growth from 86,500 to 96,960. (The Office of Economic Analysis has detailed posts on the topic.) And while some of these new hires may end up in Oregon’s retirement system, remember that they’re financed in large part by student tuition, which isn’t state tax money. Finally, we’re going to throw one last batch of numbers at you, this time from the Legislative Fiscal Office, which tracks all branches of state government as well as the universities. LFO 2005-07 2007-09 2009-11 2011-13 FTEs 47,900 49,600 51,700 50,500 We give you this additional information not to make your head hurt, but to give you different ways of viewing growth in state government. The increase in "full-time equivalent" budgeted positions is 5 percent, which is not as high as the 23 percent growth recorded by PERS. We contacted Richardson one last time, and shared our findings. He said he doesn’t have insider information as to why some numbers are higher or lower. But it doesn’t matter to him. The larger point holds: Government is not doing enough to limit costs when revenue is down. State universities, he said, could use technology and other tools to deliver classes more efficiently rather than increase tuition. "They should not be doing more of the same," he said. We can’t fault Richardson for using one set of figures to highlight growth, even though other sets suggest the growth has not been as steep. For some taxpayers, that we have more than 48,000 employees in state government and state universities is probably horrifying enough. Richardson’s underlying point that employment grew during a recession is accurate. In fact, the number of state and university employees is higher than that reported by the retirement system, as of June 30, 2011. But we downgrade our ruling for two reasons. The university system, state executive branch, and legislative fiscal office do not report the same magnitude in employee growth that’s reported by the retirement system. The 2005-06 starting point is low when compared with the other sources. We’ve asked the retirement system to explain, and they cannot find an answer. Also, if some of the increase can be attributed to increased demand at state universities -- where students in large part pay for the new hires -- it seems unfair to blame it all on Democrats’ inability to save. At the very least, that’s an important detail readers should know. For those reasons, we find his statement that the state added 9,000 employees while revenue dropped $4 billion to be partially accurate, but missing important details. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Dennis Richardson	None	None	None	2012-03-16T17:03:32	2012-02-17	['Oregon']
pomt-00311	Says "J.B. Pritzker’s tax plan" includes a "new tax per mile you drive with government tracking device."	false	/illinois/statements/2018/sep/23/bruce-rauner/rauner-veers-course-claiming-pritzker-proposed-mil/	In his re-election bid, Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner has sought to convince Illinois taxpayers that electing his Democratic opponent J.B. Pritzker spells trouble for their bottom line. In a recent campaign ad, the first-term incumbent doubled down on that narrative with several claims about Pritzker’s tax plan. The 30-second spot features a woman identified as Denise Smith who describes herself as a lifelong Illinoisan who says she may leave Illinois if Pritzker is elected because of his tax policies. While the ad contains no direct narration from the campaign, it features the following text: JB PRITZKER’S TAX PLAN INCOME TAX HIKE NEW TAX PER MILE YOU DRIVE WITH GOVERNMENT TRACKING DEVICE See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Rauner has long maintained policies Pritzker has said he supports would sock the middle class with an income tax hike. Last winter, we rated that claim Mostly False. Rauner’s mileage tax hit, on the other hand, is new. But the evidence isn’t in his favor there, either. What Pritzker said Most of the dollars Illinois puts toward road work come from a 19-cent-per-gallon tax drivers pay at the gas pump. But as cars become ever more fuel-efficient, fill-ups get less frequent, and that translates into less money collected by the state to fix roads. Some states have responded to the spread of hybrid and electric cars by launching experiments that study ways to record and tax miles traveled instead of gallons purchased. Part of the theory behind this is that electric cars, hybrids and other newer vehicles put the same wear and tear on highways as do gas guzzlers, but pay little to nothing for road repairs because their owners buy less fuel. Last January, during an interview with the Daily Herald editorial board, Pritzker said a vehicle mileage tax was an idea worth testing, but didn’t commit to any wide-scale implementation. Here’s what he said at the time about a VMT, or vehicle miles traveled tax, according to a video recording of his appearance posted by the newspaper: "You talked about a gas tax … We're challenged to come up with the dollars that we need for our highway system and for our roads. So in some states, they have done tests recently for a VMT tax ... It's only fair if you're on a road and traveling on that road that you should pay your fair share on the road like everybody else is paying. So I think it's something we should look at. We have to be careful about how it gets implemented and that's why it should only be a test at this point. I guess I'm letting you know that I recognize the challenge that we have in coming up with the dollars for our roads, particularly in that gas tax arena, and that we've got to look for different ways to fund it." Pritzker said much the same at a Downstate event in August attended by both governor candidates during which Rauner contended the Democrat had in fact proposed a mileage tax. "What I said is there are tests that have been done on this (tax) and I think we've got to look for how we're going to pay for infrastructure in the state," said Pritzker, according to the Decatur Herald & Review. "It's not anything definitive." What Rauner says Pritzker said When we reached out to Rauner’s campaign to ask when and where they’d heard Pritzker propose a mileage tax with a government tracking device, spokesman Justin Giorgio did not directly answer. "Pritzker has expressed support for a test program," Giorgio wrote in an email. "And in every other case, there has been a government tracking device." Likewise, Rauner chose his words a little more carefully during a debate last week televised on NBC 5. "He was on the record, proposing, saying we all should look at a driving tax," Rauner asserted at one point. So neither Rauner nor his spokesman now go as far as the campaign’s ad to contend Pritzker has actually proposed a mileage tax as part of his tax plan, let alone put forth a specific method for taxing those miles. As for Giorgio’s suggestion that all other pilot programs have required a "government tracking device," that is as misleading as it is sinister sounding. Oregon launched a permanent but voluntary mileage tax program in 2015. Participants, who are reimbursed state fuel tax for paying the mileage tax instead, can choose from multiple options to track their miles including a plug-in device that records mileage but does not track location. A total of nine states have run or are planning pilot programs to explore the possibility of taxing mileage, although only Oregon has implemented fees so far. Other states have also given participants a variety of choices when it came to recording their miles, including some that involve no tracking device—GPS-enabled or otherwise. California, for instance, conducted a nine-month study in which participants were allowed to sign up for odometer checks or purchase permits for a set number of days in lieu of more high-tech options. Our ruling Rauner’s ad says "Pritzker’s tax plan" includes a "new tax per mile you drive with government tracking device." But Pritzker hasn’t endorsed any plan as of yet when it comes to measuring and taxing miles driven and Rauner in a televised debate last week appeared to back away from directly claiming otherwise, although his ad is still running. Pritzker has simply said it’s an idea worth exploring as other states test the concept, given the erosion in collections from the gas tax long relied on to pay for road upkeep. And he has said nothing about a tracking device, which is only one of several options employed in mileage tracking tests conducted in other states. We rate Rauner’s claim False.

pomt-00917	On immigration, "the president said 22 times, 22 times, that he couldn't do what he eventually did."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/01/john-boehner/boehner-obama-said-22-times-he-couldnt-do-immigrat/	Republican House leaders fanned out on the Sunday shows to defend a stop-gap measure to fund the Department of Homeland Security in their ongoing fight against President Barack Obama's executive action on immigration. They did not stray from talking points. TV audiences Sunday heard one specific number several times as hosts pressed the GOP lawmakers to justify the chaos over funding for the Department of Homeland Security. "The president said 22 times, 22 times, that he couldn't do what he eventually did," House Speaker John Boehner said on CBS’ Face the Nation. Both Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Majority Whip Steve Scalise repeated the "22 times" talking point on NBC’s Meet the Press and Fox News Sunday, respectively. Even Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, one of 52 Republicans who opposed a three-week funding plan, used the figure to defend his House Freedom Caucus’ actions on CNN’s State of the Union. PolitiFact wanted to see where the number comes from and just how accurate it is. What we’re talking about The controversy stems from Obama’s Nov. 20, 2014, announcement that he would delay deportations of unauthorized immigrants who have lived in the country for more than five years but have children who are citizens or have green cards. More than 4 million people could qualify. An applicant could qualify for a work permit and avoid being deported for three years at a time if he or she can pass a background check and pay a fee. The decision is bound for higher court battles after a Texas federal judge issued a temporary injunction on the action, saying it may have violated procedural rules for using executive power. This action came on top of Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in 2012, an executive action to protect "dreamers," or people brought here illegally as children and have not committed crimes. That move, too, was viewed by critics as an abuse of power, but supporters said it helped provide a path to citizenship for hundreds of thousands of residents. After Obama’s post-midterm elections announcement on immigration, Boehner’s office unleashed a Buzzfeed-style blog post detailing "22 Times President Obama Said He Couldn’t Ignore or Create His Own Immigration Law." What’s on Boehner’s list Our PolitiFact Texas colleagues dissected Boehner’s list for similar fact-checks of U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, the Republican who led the legal challenge of Obama’s actions when he was still attorney general. PolitiFact Texas tracked down each of the citations in Boehner’s post, comparing what they said Obama said with transcripts and news stories. In a nutshell, the majority of the examples are of Obama saying he did not have power to do more on immigration without Congress. Others, as we’ll explain in a moment, say something more nuanced or aren’t specific to immigration. We won’t go through every quote that supports Boehner’s point here, but here are a few we culled from a document created by PolitiFact Texas: In September 2012, Obama was asked if he would follow up his recent protective move for students by doing something similar for non-criminal immigrants such as the parents of U.S.-born children. Obama replied that "as the head of the executive branch, there’s a limit to what I can do… we’re still going to, ultimately, have to change the laws in order to avoid some of the heartbreaking stories that you see coming up occasionally," as in parents deported. (No. 13 on Boehner’s list.) At a presidential debate in October 2012, Obama and Mitt Romney were asked: "What do you plan on doing with immigrants without their green card that are currently living here as productive members of society?" Obama said: "I've done everything that I can on my own." (No. 14 on Boehner’s list.) In a January 2013 Telemundo interview, Obama was asked why he couldn’t protect mothers living here without authorization from deportation as he had served law-abiding students. "I’m not a king," Obama replied, akin to his response the same month to a similar query from Univision. "You know, my job as the head of the executive branch ultimately is to carry out the law. And-- you know, when it comes to enforcement of our immigration laws-- we’ve got some discretion. We can prioritize-- what we do. But we can’t simply ignore the law." (No. 16 on Boehner’s list.) So clearly there are examples of Obama saying he couldn’t do more with executive action, then later doing exactly that. That’s why PolitiFact previously rated Obama’s claim that "my position hasn’t changed" as False. What should not be counted But also included on Boehner’s list of 22 are quotes where Obama was either suggesting his executive powers did not have hard limits or was silent on his executive power on immigration. Here are a few problems with quotes included on Boehner’s list. In two instances during his 2008 presidential campaign, Obama criticized "signing statements" used by President George W. Bush that interpret laws, but he did not bring up immigration. Immigration was also not part of his reply to a question at a 2010 MTV/BET event when he said, "I can’t simply ignore laws that are out there," in response to a question about "don’t ask, don’t tell." (Nos. 1, 2 and 5.) In September 2011, with his deferred-action plan on the horizon, Obama reiterated that he cannot just change laws unilaterally in response to a question about possible administrative relief for students who don’t have legal residency. But he hinted that there might be room within his authority, saying, "what we can do is to prioritize enforcement, since there are limited enforcement resources." (No. 12 on Boehner’s list.) Obama’s July 2013 Univision interview hit similar notes when he was asked if he could grant amnesty to the undocumented population. He called for a legislative solution and said "probably not," adding, "I can do some things and have done some things that make a difference in the lives of people by determining how our enforcement should focus." (No. 18 on Boehner’s list.) In August 2014, Obama told reporters he may "scour our authorities to try to make progress" without congressional cooperation. Obama said, "We’re going to make sure that every time we take one of these steps that we are working within the confines of my executive power. But I promise you the American people don’t want me just standing around twiddling my thumbs and waiting for Congress to get something done." (No. 22 on Boehner’s list.) Asked why Boehner continues to cite 22 examples, spokesman Michael Steel told PolitiFact "we obviously stand by" the count. Pressed to explain why, he said, "Obviously, we're just going to agree to disagree about the ‘22 times’ figure, which we feel is accurate." The bigger picture Whether the real number is 22, 15 or something less than that is more complicated by the specifics of Boehner’s claim. Boehner's claim is Obama said he couldn’t do "what he eventually did." Experts we talked to noted that Obama was not always so specific in the comments Boehner and his team cited. Boehner’s count factors in both instances of Obama talking about how he could not legalize or deport the entire undocumented population as well as more limited executive actions to relieve smaller populations. "It gives me a headache," said Anna O. Law, a CUNY Brooklyn College political science professor, of the post, "because they’re playing semantics." Alex Nowrasteh, a Cato Institute immigration analyst, said he did not know what to make of the "very political" claim. Ultimately, much of it depends on your specific interpretation of each quote. Our ruling Boehner said, "The president said 22 times, 22 times, that he couldn't do what he eventually did." Boehner's broader point -- that Obama said one thing about executive action but did another -- is accurate. But he should refrain from the rhetorical flourish of saying Obama said it 22 times. We rate this claim Mostly True. Clarification: This item was updated on March 2, 2015, to better explain the ruling of a federal judge in Texas.

pomt-07402	"There are legitimate and widespread anomalies, and widespread questions about the conduct of (the Wisconsin Supreme Court) election, most visibly in Waukesha County, but also in counties around the state."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/apr/29/joanne-kloppenburg/joanne-kloppenburg-says-anomalies-were-widespread-/	Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate JoAnne Kloppenburg declared victory on election night when preliminary, unofficial returns put her 204 votes ahead of Justice David Prosser. Fifteen days later, she sought a statewide recount after the official county-by-county returns showed her trailing by more than 7,300 votes out of 1.5 million cast. In explaining her decision, Kloppenburg told reporters that a recount may not get her over the top, but would shine a light on "an election that right now seems to so many people to be suspect." She also went on the offensive, raising questions about the legitimacy of the vote count around the state. "There are legitimate and widespread anomalies," said Kloppenburg, a state Justice Department attorney, "and widespread questions about the conduct of this election, most visibly in Waukesha County, but also in counties around the state." The Waukesha County problems are well known: A vote-tallying glitch belatedly boosted Prosser’s total in the official count by almost 7,600. County Clerk Kathy Nickolaus, a Republican in a GOP stronghold, didn’t report her error for more than a day after the election. Given the outrage over the Waukesha incident, Kloppenburg seems on solid ground suggesting that there are "widespread questions" about the election. But are there "widespread anomalies" in the statewide count? That’s a much different claim and one we can check. In order to justify her claim, we think Kloppenburg has to show that numerous questionable situations remain that are "irregular" or "abnormal" -- a dictionary definition of "anomalous." In addition to the Waukesha situation, Kloppenburg at the news conference cited an "undervote" in Milwaukee and Racine; ballot shortages and long lines in Fond du Lac and several other municipalities; and changes in the unofficial vote totals in Winnebago County. Let’s take a look: "Undervotes": This is when a voter chooses not to vote in all the races listed on a ballot -- creating an "undervote" in one race compared with another. For instance, this year in the city of Milwaukee, the Milwaukee County executive’s race drew about 2,000 more votes than the Kloppenburg-Prosser race at the top of the ticket. Kloppenburg campaign manager Melissa Mulliken said Racine and Milwaukee had an unusually high undervote rate in the statewide court race compared with local races there. "You wonder why," Mulliken said. "Did voting machines misread ballots?" But in the city of Milwaukee, the 2011 court contest was not the largest court-race undervote in even the last three years. In 2008, when Michael Gableman defeated incumbent Louis Butler for the high court, the Scott Walker-Lena Taylor race for county executive drew 3,500 more votes. A review going back further shows the court races sometimes draw more and sometimes less than other contests, depending on the competitiveness of the races involved. In Racine, the Kloppenburg-Prosser race drew fewer votes than the Racine mayor’s race. It was about 150 votes short, or 1 percent. That, too, has happened before: In 2009, Justice Shirley Abrahamson’s breeze to re-election drew substantially fewer votes than a special primary election for Racine mayor. But in 2008, the Gableman-Butler race drew just slightly more than a statewide referendum in Racine. Not much of a pattern there. Neil Albrecht, deputy director of the Milwaukee Election Commission, said undervoting is not really an anomaly. "It’s more a reflection with people's comfort and familiarity with certain contests and the candidates," he said. UW-Madison political scientist Barry Burden agreed. "‘Dropoff’ is the term we use," said Burden, who studies election administration. "It doesn’t surprise me at all. That’s reasonable to expect when you have a local race that is grabbing a lot of attention." (Local conditions played out the other way in another Democratic hotbed, Dane County. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s Craig Gilbert reported that 10,000 more people voted in the court race than in a county exec’s race that was not even close.) Ballot shortages: The unusually high voter turnout in the high court race -- at least 14 points higher statewide than predicted -- fueled ballot shortages in various communities. Kloppenburg cited Fond du Lac County. State election officials ordered the clerk in the city of Fond du Lac to issue substitute ballots because of shortages, and the resulting lines at touchscreen machines and delays in voting. Our research found other shortages in the counties of Eau Claire, Sheboygan and Winnebago. Together, they involved more than 2,000 votes on photocopied ballots that had to be hand counted. How unusual is this? There are mixed views. Burden said the use of photocopied ballots is fairly common but rarely noticed unless a race is close. It’s common enough for the state to have a law that sets out the procedure for issuing substitute ballots when shortages occur, said Reid Magney, spokesman for the state’s Governmental Accountability Board. One clerk, Lisa Freiberg of Fond du Lac County, said it was "very unusual" in her county to resort to copying paper ballots. Fond du Lac City Clerk Sue Strands, who orders ballots, agreed. Strands said she considers her vote count solid. She said if there was an "anomaly" it was limited to four instances in which voters tried to put their copied ballot into voting machines. They jammed. Kloppenburg’s campaign says the question is how such ballots were counted. There is some concern about reliable counts of photocopied ballots, because they can’t be run through voting machines, election clerks say. That necessitated some hand-counting on a busy election night. Discrepancies in unofficial results: It’s clear the big Waukesha County vote tally error on election night was unusual. PolitiFact Wisconsin earlier examined a Nickolaus claim that errors in that part of the process are "common." We found that her error was extreme but not unprecedented, and we rated her claim Barely True. It’s important to note that errors such as the Waukesha County tally and the 1,100-vote miscommunication in the unofficial tally from Winnebago County are reviewed -- and typically corrected -- in the official vote canvasses done by the counties. That process -- plus a special state probe of Waukesha County -- is now complete and state officials say the Waukesha and Winnebago discrepancies have been cleared up. So if that verification process is already done, does that leave Kloppenburg with much justification for including Waukesha on her problem list? She points out the state will do a deeper investigation of Nickolaus’ past work -- and that the preliminary state probe did find a handful of discrepancies in the county’s canvass of write-in votes. So, has Kloppenburg supported her claim? Her "undervote" claims do not hold up; they are not anomalous based on historical patterns. Errors in the unofficial tally were mostly routine and by now have likely been corrected by the standard post-election canvasses. Waukesha County’s situation was rare, but it is only one county, and the big discrepancy there has already been cleared up, according to state elections officials. In Kloppenburg’s favor: Ballot shortages -- though not rare and not by themselves evidence of miscounts -- did happen in multiple areas and are by no means the norm. And the Waukesha County situation, while already investigated at length, still has a few loose ends, and questions remain about Nickolaus’ methods. So, Kloppenburg’s claim had an element of truth but skipped critical facts that would give a different impression. Some might call it mostly false. But on the Truth-O-Meter, that’s the definition of Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	JoAnne Kloppenburg	None	None	None	2011-04-29T09:00:00	2011-04-20	['Waukesha_County,_Wisconsin', 'Wisconsin_Supreme_Court']
pomt-12145	Tornado carries mobile home 130 miles, family inside unharmed.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/10/blog-posting/no-tornado-did-not-carry-mobile-home-130-miles-awa/	It’s not true that a tornado lifted a mobile home and carried it over 130 miles until it landed in a rural Kansas area. And since that never happened, it’s also fake news that there were five family members inside that house who came out of the ordeal without major injuries. A website called Daily Native American, dailynative.us, posted the fabricated story on Aug. 6, 2017, but the claims have circulated for years. Satirical website worldnewsdailyreport.com posted the same story back in 2015. "A family from Tulsa, Oklahoma, underwent the scariest experience of their life yesterday, when their mobile home was carried over 130 miles by a tornado, landing in a rural Kansas area. Five members of the same family were inside the building during its ‘flight’, and all of them have miraculously survived without injuries," said the dailynative.us post. "41-year old Dorothy Williams, was at home with her husband, her son, and her two brothers, when their mobile home was lifted off the ground by an F4 tornado." The story claims the tornado carried the house for more than four hours "sometimes at altitude of more than 1,000 feet," across northern Colorado, southern Kansas and then dropped it on a car outside of Wichita, "129.5 miles (208.5 kilometers) away from its point of origin." We asked the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration what they thought of the dailynative.us post. "That's not possible," said Harold Brooks, senior research scientist at NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory. Most tornadoes last less than 10 minutes and travel an average 3.5 miles. Stories of papers, checks and other feather-light objects traveling 100 miles do sometimes check out. But heavy objects cannot cover the same ground. Brooks said even in the "most violent events," wind could not usher a Tulsa mobile home northwest over Colorado before landing near Wichita in southern Kansas. "That’s a rare direction for even paper to get thrown over significant distances," he said. Dailynative.us does not feature an "About Us" page detailing who’s behind it or what is it’s purpose. Allusions to The Wizard of Oz did not go unnoticed to some readers. "Sorry is it just me or has someone else heard all this before? …Dorothy? The house lands safely (somewhere in Kansas)? … was she wearing red shoes by any chance? And was there a wicked witch in the car that the house landed on?" wrote a worldnewsdailyreport.com reader in August 2017.

pomt-06162	Nevada has been recently ranked No. 1 in "unemployment, foreclosures, violent crime, personal bankruptcy and divorce."	true	/florida/statements/2011/dec/16/florida-chamber-commerce/fl-chamber-ceo-says-nevada-no-1-unemployment-forec/	As the January 2012 state legislative session draws near, supporters and opponents are organizing to make their voices heard about a proposed bill that would allow three massive casino resorts in South Florida. On Dec. 8, 2011, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam -- both Republicans -- held a press conference with opponents to publicly denounce the gambling bill. In an article about that press conference posted on WTSP 10 News, a Tampa Bay station, Mark Wilson, the CEO of the Florida Chamber of Commerce, piped up about his opposition, too. The report paraphrased Wilson as saying that the casinos would take money away from existing businesses and lead to other problems. He pointed to the state of Nevada, where gambling is prevalent, as an example. Nevada, he said, "can keep their recent No. 1 rankings in unemployment, foreclosures, violent crime, personal bankruptcy and divorce. They can keep their No. 1 rankings." For this fact-check, we won't begin to address whether gambling is to blame for the statistics Wilson cited. We are examining whether he had them correct. Wilson's spokeswoman, Edie Ousley, said that the unemployment and foreclosure data came from 2011 data, that the personal bankruptcy statistic was from 2010 and the violent crime and divorce data was from 2009. She sent us a document from CQ Press that pulled numbers from many sources including the census, Small Business Administration, FBI and administrative office of the U.S. courts. Katy Sorenson, a former Miami-Dade County Commissioner who is now the CEO of The Good Government Initiative at the University of Miami, also cited similar statistics attributed to the Congressional District Ranking Book in a guest editorial in the Miami Herald Dec. 10. We will use CQ's research as well as our own to look at each category cited by Wilson: Unemployment: The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that in October 2011 unemployment in Nevada was 13.4 percent -- the highest state (the list includes Puerto Rico at 16.1 percent but Puerto Rico is a territory not a state). Foreclosures: RealtyTrac shows a map of foreclosures nationwide as of October 2011 which shows for Nevada one home in every 180 is in foreclosure -- the highest in the country in terms of the ratio. (Nevada isn't the highest in sheer numbers -- there are more foreclosures in more populous states such as California and Florida.) Violent crime: The FBI's 2010 statistics show 17,841 violent crimes (murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault) in the state of Nevada, for a rate of 660.6 per 100,000 occupants. Nevada's rate was the second highest in the country behind the District of Columbia, which had a rate of 1,330.2. (Nevada wasn't the second highest in sheer number of crimes because some states with larger populations, for example New York and California, had higher numbers of total violent crimes.) Since the chamber said Wilson was referring to 2009, we looked at the FBI's violent crime report for 2009, too, and found again the District of Columbia at No. 1 at 1345.9 and Nevada's rate at 702.2. The District of Columbia isn't a state so we think it's fair here to say Nevada had the highest crime rate amongst the states. Personal bankruptcy: Using data collected from U.S. Bankruptcy Courts during a 12-month period ending in September 2010, Nevada ranked No. 1 in terms of the personal bankruptcy rate. The state had 1,121 nonbusiness bankruptcies per 100,000 population. We found bankruptcy statistics for the 12-month period ending in September 2011, but it showed the number of bankruptcy cases -- not the rate. Divorce: CQ used 2009 data from the National Center for Health Statistics, which found that Nevada had the highest divorce rate among states reporting (6.7 per 1,000 population). We corroborated the data through the National Center. However, six states did not collect the information for 2009. Center spokesman Jeffrey Lancashire said the group no longer collects detailed divorce data because not all the states collect the information. "The exact reasons vary from state to state, but likely it is budget-related," he said in an e-mail. "But when a state like California doesn’t collect the information, it is real problematic to produce good national data." The census also measures marital status rates for each state. The census shows that Nevada had a divorce rate of 12.3 percent for males and 14.6 percent for females between 2005 and 2007. According to the census, Wyoming had a slightly higher rate of divorced males -- 12.6 percent -- but Nevada was No. 1 for divorced females. Another product created by the U.S. Census Bureau, the 2010 American Community Survey showed that Nevada had a 12.4 percent divorce rate for women -- placing it in a tie for 9th place with Tennessee -- and a 14 percent divorce rate for men -- ranking it first. Which divorce statistic should we give most weight? Robert Bernstein, a spokesman with the census, suggested that we use the National Center for Health Statistics data because that represents the official divorce rates and is based on vital statistics while the American Community Survey data are based on responses by survey respondents. That puts Wilson on solid footing. Our ruling Mark Wilson, the CEO of the Florida Chamber of Commerce, said that Nevada has been recently ranked No. 1 in unemployment, foreclosures, violent crime, personal bankruptcy and divorce. The state of Nevada is clearly No. 1 in its unemployment and foreclosure rate -- and it's the highest for violent crime, too, if we omit the District of Columbia, which isn't a state. CQ's analysis shows Nevada at the top spot for personal bankruptcy. The statistics on divorce are somewhat more complicated but one recent source, the National Center for Health Statistics, concluded Nevada's overall divorce rate was the highest in the country in 2009 among the states for which such data was available. We rate this statement True.	None	Florida Chamber of Commerce	None	None	None	2011-12-16T15:38:32	2011-12-08	['None']
pomt-01851	"Radio Marti and TV Marti have spent more than $500 million to reach less than 1 percent of the Cuban population."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/14/lawrence-odonnell/msnbcs-odonnell-washington-has-spent-over-500-mill/	Over the decades since the Cuban revolution, American feelings toward our closest Communist neighbor have mellowed, if only just a bit. According to a Gallup poll, antipathy toward restoring ties with Cuba has inched down since the 1970s. Other research suggests a generational shift is underway as U.S.-born Cuban Americans come of age and move away from the firm anti-communist line of the Republican Party. MSNBC host Lawrence O’Donnell took aim at the American broadcasts designed to stir discontent with the Cuban government, Radio Marti and TV Marti. Both seek to offer Cubans an alternative source of news. O’Donnell cast them as a colossal waste of taxpayer money. "Radio Marti and TV Marti have spent more than $500 million to reach less than 1 percent of the Cuban population, and as far as we can tell, change their minds about nothing," O’Donnell said on July 8, 2014. "No politician who seriously aspires to the president who will dare to say a word about this wasted $500 million, because when it comes to Cuba policy, the American government is still crazy after all these years." We can’t know whether these American broadcasts have shaped the opinions of Cubans, but we can look into O’Donnell’s claim about the money and the market penetration. Limited audience data O’Donnell’s colleagues at MSNBC pointed to a 2009 Government Accountability Office report. The GAO works on behalf of Congress to assess whether government programs spend their money wisely and achieve what they were set up to do. The 2009 study focused on TV Marti but at the very top, it spoke to the total spending. "More than $500 million that has been spent over the years on broadcasting to Cuba," the GAO analysts wrote. We found a 2011 GAO report that put total spending at $660 million since the launch of Radio Marti in the mid 1980s. As for the television operation’s audience, the 2009 GAO report said that the best available research shows that "it is small." The International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB) oversees the Marti project. "Less than 1 percent of respondents to IBB telephone surveys since 2003 reported that they had watched TV Martí during the past week," the report said. "Notably, results from the 2006 and 2008 telephone surveys show no increase in reported TV Martí viewership following the launch of AeroMarti and DirecTV broadcasting in 2006." AeroMarti was a $5 million a year effort to broadcast from an airplane. It has since ended. DirecTV made programs available to those Cubans with illegal dish antennas. Measuring audience size in Cuba, for either television or radio, faces a huge hurdle -- tuning in could get you in trouble with the government. The GAO report notes, this makes it difficult to get reliable responses. Daniel Walsh is a communications professor at Appalachian State University who has studied America’s broadcast efforts in Cuba. "There is no real way to get valid audience numbers for Radio Marti," Walsh said. "I would say that 1 percent may be a bit low but not far off. Some Cubans, including government officials, listen to Radio Marti but don't admit it." The International Broadcasting Bureau hired a firm to place calls to Cuba, mainly from Costa Rica. But according to the Cuban telecomm company Etesca, there are only about 2 million cell phone lines and about 1.3 million landlines. With a total population of more than 11 million, phone calls are unlikely to reach a representative sample. A 2010 Senate Foreign Relations Committee report summarized recent survey results for the radio service. "Fewer than 2 percent of respondents in 2003, 2005, and 2006 said they listened to Radio Marti during the previous week," the report said. "In 2008, fewer than 1 percent of respondents said they listened to Radio Marti during the previous week." The numbers have not always been so low. Philip Peters served in the State Department during the Reagan and Bush administrations. In congressional testimony in 2002, Peters said he believed in the project’s mission but drew attention to an "alarming statistic." "Radio Marti’s audience share has plummeted to 5 percent in 2001, down from 9 percent in 2000 and 71 percent 10 years ago, according to professional survey research commissioned by the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), Radio Marti’s oversight body," Peters said. According to the GAO, concerns about the validity of these audience measures led the IBB to halt telephone surveys after 2008. The division that runs Radio and TV Marti, the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, has interviewed recent arrivals from Cuba. Their results show significantly higher penetration. About 30 percent said they had listened to Radio Marti at some point during their last six months in Cuba. However, about half of those said they stopped because Cuban jamming made it difficult to listen. About 4 percent said they had watched TV Marti. Program administrators cautioned that these results also fail to give an accurate view of market penetration because the total number of people surveyed is small, less than 400, and people who have chosen to leave Cuba do not represent a random sample. Nicholas Cull, a professor at the University of Southern California, has studied the Marti project and believes it lacks an appreciable following in Cuba. "Everything I've heard suggests it is tiny," Cull said. Cuban jamming efforts present a consistent challenge to American government broadcasting. The Cuban government can effectively block reception by broadcasting on the same frequency as the American programs but at a much higher power. The U.S. response has been to shift frequencies up to 10 times a day (with an unknown impact on listenership), and to build a digital distribution strategy that uses cell phone text messaging, DVDs and flash drive technologies. According to the Broadcasting Board of Governors 2013 annual report, text messages and emails "reach nearly 1 million Cubans each week." However, a spokesperson said it is unclear how many messages are read. Staff told PunditFact there are more than 660,000 cell phone numbers and more than 360,000 email addresses in their distribution database. They said they harvested this information from the Web and online sources and verified that the numbers and addresses were still active. The texting and email effort began three years ago. According to government data, there are around 1 million cell phones in total in Cuba. The size of the Marti database might represent significant market penetration, although staff said "the vast majority of the cell phones and emails we have in our distribution lists did not opt-in." That is, the Cubans did not request the information the Marti service offers. About 45,000 texts go out each month. In the past six months, the Office of Cuba Broadcasting has received 349 texts. Staff said Cuba is able to block sensitive messages based on key words. The International Broadcasting Bureau has developed applications for smart phones for users to share messages, but the Cuban government moved only a few months ago to begin email access over its wireless network. The cost is very high, about $1.20 per megabyte. The average worker makes, officially, about $20 a month. Our ruling O’Donnell said that the United States had spent over $500 million to reach less than 1 percent of the Cuban population. The weight of the GAO findings, the assessment from one of the program’s early supporters, and outside experts largely confirm O’Donnell’s numbers. If anything, the government has spent more than O’Donnell said. He might have overstated how small the audience actually is, but independent government reviewers conclude that the audience is small. The new distribution methods of text and email come with some impressive numbers, but there is no verification that a substantial portion of these messages get through. While the quality of the data can be questioned, the numbers that do exist suggest O’Donnell was largely correct. We rate the claim Mostly True. Update: The Cuban telecomm company Etesca said there are approximately 3.3 million cell phone and land lines in Cuba. This story has been updated to reflect that point.

pomt-09681	Says she couldn't take stimulus money because it required "universal building codes."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/16/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-claims-weatherization-money-stimulus-r/	Sarah Palin has been a vocal opponent of the economic stimulus package ever since it was proposed by President Barack Obama, and she makes that point again in her new book, Going Rogue . Back in March 2009, then-Gov. Palin called the stimulus plan a "bribe" intended to "grow government" and she vowed to turn down as much as a third of the money available to Alaska. But the Republican-controlled Alaska Legislature fought her on it, and she ultimately accepted all but 3 percent of the more than $900 million available to Alaska. The 3 percent that she vetoed was $28.6 million in federal stimulus money for weatherization and other projects to make new and existing homes and buildings more energy efficient. She claimed then, as she does again in her book, that the money had not just string but "ropes" attached to it that would require the state to adopt universal building codes. Here's how she described it in the book: "The documents clearly stated that acceptance of the funds required the adoption and enforcement of energy building codes," she wrote. "Universal building codes -- in Alaska! A practical, libertarian haven full of independent Americans who did not desire 'help' from government busybodies. A state full of hardy pioneers who did not like taking orders from the feds telling us to change our laws. A state so geographically diverse that one-size-fits-all codes simply wouldn't work." At PolitiFact, we looked at that claim in some detail back in early June after she said the money would require "universal energy building codes for Alaska, kind of a one-size-fits-all building code that isn't going to work up there in Alaska." Many state legislators in Alaska said Palin was overstating things. Even a number of Republicans in the Alaska Legislature said Palin was wrong. In fact, Anchorage Republican Rep. Mike Hawker was quoted in the Anchorage Daily News saying that he believed Palin "had to do something to save face" after initially promising to turn away a third of the stimulus money, but then vetoing just 3 percent. But Palin stuck to her claim, and pointed to a provision in the stimulus that tied the energy efficiency money to assurances that the state or local governments "will implement" a "building energy code for residential buildings that meets or exceeds the most recently published International Energy Conservation Code, or achieves equivalent or greater energy savings" as well as building energy codes for commercial buildings throughout the state that meet federal standards. She vetoed the funds even after getting a clarifying letter from Steven G. Chalk of the Department of Energy, who stated that the stimulus provision recognizes that not every state has statewide building codes, and that the governor does not have the authority to force local governments to implement building codes. In those cases, Chalk wrote, it's sufficient for the governor to simply "promote" the codes. It is enough, he wrote, for the state to work with local governments to create model energy efficiency standards, but no municipality would be forced to adopt any new codes. As for Palin's claims of "one-size-fits-all" building codes, Chalk wrote that the provision "provides flexibility with regard to building codes" and "expressly includes standards other than those cited so long as the standards achieve equivalent energy savings." In August, the Alaska Legislature voted in an emergency session to override Palin's veto of the energy money, an unusual event that requires 75 percent approval. As for Palin's claim that Alaska is a "practical, libertarian haven full of independent Americans who did not desire 'help' from government busybodies," the Associated Press noted recently that for a state that doesn't "desire" help from the federal government, they get an awful lot of it. A study by the Tax Foundation of federal taxes paid versus spending received, by state, in 2005 -- the latest year available -- found that Alaska received $1.84 for every federal tax dollar it sent to Washington (ranking Alaska third in the nation that year). It was the 20th year in a row that Alaska got more back from the government than residents paid in federal taxes. The wording in the stimulus bill related to the weatherization money may have left room for Palin's concerns, but the letter from the Department of Energy made clear that universal building codes were not going to be forced upon state and local governments as a condition for accepting the federal money. Palin's opposition to the funding may give her license to claim she opposed the stimulus plan -- even though it was only a small portion of Alaska's funding -- but her reasoning doesn't jibe with the assurances from the Department of Energy. We rule her claim False.	None	Sarah Palin	None	None	None	2009-11-16T18:28:27	2009-11-17	['None']
pomt-04627	Says Congressman Jon Runyan has a "plan to raise Medicare costs $6,400 a year."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/sep/16/shelley-adler/medicare-and-football-democratic-congressional-can/	A former offensive tackle for the Philadelphia Eagles, U.S. Rep. Jon Runyan has apparently found new opponents to tackle on a front lawn or block from a pharmacy counter: senior citizens on Medicare. That’s at least the message in a new TV ad from his Democratic challenger, Shelley Adler, who is looking to unseat the Republican congressman in the Nov. 6 general election. The ad, released Sept. 12 on YouTube, features a mock sports broadcast about Runyan’s support for a Medicare reform proposal from Wisconsin congressman and Republican vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan. Two broadcasters deliver a play-by-play account as a man wearing a suit and a football helmet tackles an elderly man mowing his lawn, and then holds back two senior citizens struggling to grab medicine from a pharmacist. One broadcaster says, "No one likes his plan to raise Medicare costs $6,400 a year," and the other broadcaster adds, "But Runyan won’t budge." But Adler deserves a penalty flag of her own. That $6,400 estimate applies to Ryan’s old Medicare plan -- not the current one -- and the TV ad wrongly suggests those higher costs would impact current Medicare beneficiaries. Adler spokesman Michael Muller argued the "ad speaks to the long term future of the program," and defended using the $6,400 figure. "This is what he voted for. Voters have a right to know that," Muller told us. "His record is what it is." The outdated figure cited in the TV ad is based on an April 2011 report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. The think tank used data from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to analyze the Medicare plan put forward by Ryan in early 2011. Under that plan, future beneficiaries, starting in 2022, would not be allowed to enroll in the current Medicare program. Instead, they would receive "premium support" payments to put toward private insurance premiums. The think tank report estimated that a beneficiary in 2022 would pay $6,350 more in out-of-pocket costs for private coverage than under traditional Medicare. But here’s the problem: Ryan has since revised his plan, making changes to how those payments would be calculated and how they could be spent. Under Ryan’s latest plan, future beneficiaries, starting in 2023, could use the payments for private plans as well as a plan that acts like traditional Medicare. Also, the payments would be based on the second least-expensive plan available, and slightly more generous in how fast they would increase. So, the payments should be enough to cover the two cheapest plans offered. As for Runyan, he has voted in favor of both versions of Ryan’s Medicare plan. But the budget office has not analyzed how this latest proposal would specifically affect beneficiary costs. In a March 2012 report, the budget office said "beneficiaries might face higher costs," but added the "CBO does not have the capability at this time to estimate such effects for the specified path of Medicare spending." Still, it’s misleading for Adler to cite a figure based on an old version of Ryan’s proposal. Another problem with Adler’s TV ad is it fails to mention how that $6,400 estimate only applies to future beneficiaries. Current beneficiaries would be able to remain in the current Medicare program and face no premium support payments. But viewers are left to infer the payments and the $6,400 figure would affect people already on Medicare. Calling the ad "dishonest," Runyan spokesman Chris Russell said in an e-mail that the congressman "voted to protect Medicare for current seniors and preserve it for future generations." Our ruling Adler’s TV ad claimed Runyan has a "plan to raise Medicare costs $6,400 a year," suggesting the higher costs would impact current beneficiaries. But that figure is based on an old version of the Medicare reform plan, and does not account for changes made in the latest proposal. Also, that estimate does not apply to current beneficiaries, who could remain in the existing program. Since Runyan voted for the old plan, we give Adler’s statement a Mostly False.

pomt-05821	"'Wrong precinct' rules exacerbate our provisional ballot problems (and) HB 194 does nothing to solve the wrong-precinct problem."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/feb/20/kathleen-clyde/state-rep-kathleen-clyde-says-new-election-law-doe/	Provisional ballots are used in general elections when there is a question about a voter's eligibility at a polling station. Poll workers allow the person to vote with a provisional ballot until the problem is sorted out, and if the person is an eligible voter, then the ballot is counted. PolitiFact Ohio recently checked -- and rated as True -- the claim that Ohio has one of the highest provisional ballot rates in the country, and that many of those ballots go uncounted. State Rep. Kathleen Clyde of Kent raised the issue in discussion about House Bill 194, the controversial overhaul of Ohio election laws that was passed last spring but will go on the ballot in November as a referendum issue. Clyde pointed to numbers in the Election Day Survey Report of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission showing that the biggest reason for provisional balloting in Ohio is change of address. But, she added, the problem of provisional ballots and uncounted votes is worsened by Ohio's "wrong precinct" rules. "Wrong precinct rules exacerbate our provisional ballot problems," she said in an email. "HB 194 does nothing to solve the wrong-precinct problem." Rather, she said, the law makes it worse by eliminating the requirement that poll workers must direct a voter to their correct precinct." PolitiFact Ohio can't fact-check the future, so we won't rate the question of whether HB 194 will worsen provisional ballot problems. But we can look at the rules and at HB 194. Voting in the wrong precinct is the biggest reason, after change of address, for provisional ballots. Provisional ballots can be cast in the wrong precinct because poll workers accidentally send voters to the wrong table in a polling place with multiple precincts, or to the wrong polling place, which can follow an error such as a poll worker misreading a street guide. Reports from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission show that relatively few states reject significant numbers of provisional ballots because they were cast in the wrong precinct. Only New York and Arizona rejected more wrong precinct ballots than Ohio in 2008, according to the EAC, and those three states accounted for the majority of the nation's total. In 2010, no state left more provisional ballots uncounted than Ohio. Rejected wrong-precinct ballots represent registered voters whose ballots were thrown out because they went to the wrong table or location. Ohio had 14,227 of them in 2008, according to the EAC report. The number is slightly larger, 14,335, on the website of Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted. House Bill 3, the Ohio elections law enacted in 2006, expanded provisional voting and restricted the counting of provisional ballots. It required that a provisional ballot be cast in the correct jurisdiction to count, and specifically defined jurisdiction as precinct. Election boards previously could count the races for a voter's correct precinct on a misdirected ballot. HB 194 "permits, instead of requires, an election official to direct a voter who is in the wrong precinct to the voter's correct precinct," according to the Ohio Legislative Service Commission. It says that it is the duty of the individual voter to ensure that a ballot is cast in the correct precinct. We note that we’re not taking a position on whether it’s good policy to leave that duty with the individual voter. Suffice to say that Clyde’s position is that more should be done. The issue went to federal court recently because of a race for juvenile court judge in Hamilton County that has been unresolved since Election Night 2010 because of provisional ballots. The two candidates in that race were separated by 23 votes in the election board's tally, but 849 provisional ballots were not counted due to error. Hundreds of those votes should be counted, U.S. District Judge Susan Dlott ruled this month in a 93-page decision. In some cases, Dlott noted, voters showed up at the right polling place, but mistakenly voted at the wrong precinct table, an error known as "right church, wrong pew." Testimony showed that poll workers mistakenly directed some voters to the wrong table, and that some poll workers did not recognize the significance of voting at the correct precinct table. Currently under Ohio's precinct-based voting, Dlott wrote, votes cast in the wrong precinct are not to be "counted under any circumstance, even when the ballot is miscast due to poll worker error." She said that policy "is fundamentally unfair and abrogates the 14th Amendment’s guarantee of due process of law." The ruling reinforces Clyde’s assertion that wrong-precinct rules worsen the problems with provisional voting. Clyde said that "wrong precinct rules exacerbate our provisional ballot problems," a reference to the high rate of provisional voting in the state. Data from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission shows that wrong precinct voting is the No. 2 reason for provisional voting. In Ohio, votes cast in the wrong precinct are not counted. There were more than 14,000 such ballots in the 2008 election. We’re not rating whether HB 194 will worsen those problems. But that the legislation "permits, instead of requires, an election official to direct a voter who is in the wrong precinct to the voter's correct precinct," shows it’s not an attempt to aggressively address the issue. The duty remains on the individual voter to ensure that a ballot is cast in the correct precinct. On the Truth-O-Meter, Clyde's statement rates True.

pomt-07037	"Rick Scott has destroyed over 100,000 jobs."	false	/florida/statements/2011/jul/01/rod-smith/top-state-democrat-claims-job-losses-not-gains-tai/	Florida Democrats are countering Gov. Rick Scott's claims about creating jobs, by saying the first-term governor is in fact killing them. Since at least April, the Florida Democratic Party has repeated in news releases, in e-mail to supporters, on their website and with social media a particularly appealing fact: Scott has destroyed 100,000 jobs. Here's one example from a mass e-mail June 28, 2011, from the chairman of the Florida Democratic Party, Rod Smith: "Rick Scott has destroyed over 100,000 jobs, gutted the education budget, and remains completely out-of-touch with Floridians." We wondered, what's behind that 100,000? Back in April, Democrats launched a website, www.WhereIsMyFloridaJob.com, to "hold Rick Scott accountable." But when we tried to visit it in June, it showed a single sentence: "Site maintenance in progress." So we asked Eric Jotkoff, spokesman for the Florida Democrats, to explain how they are getting their numbers. He explained it was a "pretty conservative estimate" based on expected teacher layoffs, cuts to local police, firefighters and other public employees, cuts to Medicaid reimbursement rates, cuts to university spending, the planned privatization of South Florida prisons, the rejection of federal funding for high-speed rail, the shift of funding from a transportation trust fund expected to affect construction projects, a change in how water districts are funded, and Scott's refusal to meet with a biotech company (Jackson Labs) that ultimately didn't locate a new project in the state. Jotkoff also left the door open for other job-killers he wasn't thinking of just then. (At the time we asked, he also included possible death of SunRail — which a few days later the governor actually allowed to move forward.) To recap: budget cuts, prison privatization, high-speed rail, Jackson Labs. Rather than a spreadsheet, Democrats say they kept an informal tally that shifts as time passes. In April, the 100,000 was based on the governor's proposed budget. Now that the legislative session has passed, it's based on the state budget as signed by the governor, with a few other actions for good measure. In any case, it's always been close enough to round up to 100,000, Jotkoff said. (We did throw his estimates into a spreadsheet, and with SunRail they came close, to around 96,000 jobs. Several items had wiggle-room that could have pushed the number above 100,000.) But no matter what the estimates say on any given day, the Democrats' claim has several problems: • "Has destroyed" makes it sound like jobs are already gone — but the analysis is almost entirely based on jobs that are expected to be lost. • "Has destroyed" also makes it sound like Scott's policies have eliminated 100,000 jobs that already existed. But that's only the case for some of the jobs included in Jotkoff's tally, such as cuts leading to layoffs of state and local employees. Others, from high-speed rail to highway construction to biotech jobs, didn't yet exist — and may never have materialized. • In the same way it's troublesome for Scott to take credit for job creation, it's also problematic for Democrats to singularly blame Scott for job losses. The Legislature debated and passed the budgets that reduce funding for local districts, and signed off on a reduction to the state workforce. Ultimately, they share some responsibility for those jobs losses as well. There's one more significant problem with basing this claim on expected changes: Nobody knows how many jobs may actually be shed, much less the Democrats. In at least half the categories Jotkoff gave us, the estimates were "thousands" or "tens of thousands." In some cases (transportation trust fund, Medicaid spending) projections were based on estimates by industry and interest groups. In others (Jackson Labs) the promises of new jobs were so ethereal, local governments weren't even certain they would come to be — yet Jotkoff blamed Scott for the loss of the maximum number of jobs the company thought it might create over 20 years, about 3,000. Jotkoff told us he was pressed for time to make his case -- though we gave him several days to respond to our questions. Here at PolitiFact Florida, we dare to dream that if you routinely repeat a number for months, you've got the goods to prove it. It's entirely possible that when the dust settles, Scott — who advocates cutting government jobs to encourage job-creation in the private sector — will have hurt employment in the state by 100,000. But this evidence doesn't prove that. And that's not even what Democrats charged — they said he has already destroyed 100,000 jobs. Meanwhile, the best evidence we do have, survey estimates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, show the state has actually added 76,800 net jobs since January. We know that the budget passed by the Legislature and signed by Scott contains real pain for Florida families, in particular teachers and state workers. But Democrats should focus on claims they can prove, and this isn't one of them. We rate it False.	None	Rod Smith	None	None	None	2011-07-01T19:11:57	2011-06-28	['None']
pomt-05400	"The failed economic policies" of President Barack Obama, the Democrats and the Federal Reserve "are making gas prices higher while America’s economy is running on fumes."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/may/04/eric-hovde/eric-hovde-says-economic-policies-are-whats-making/	In late March 2012, gas prices in the Milwaukee area hit a record high, $4.20 a gallon, according to AAA Wisconsin. While prices have come down, to about $3.83 a gallon, that milestone ignited a new round in the political blame game. We’ve heard some of these claims many times -- there’s not enough oil drilling, we’re too dependent on foreign oil, Obama is standing in the way of the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada. (PolitiFact’s National site has an entire section devoted to the topic.) In Wisconsin, a radio ad from Republican U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde tapped into the frustration that many motorists feel when they fill their tanks. In the ad, Hovde says Obama and Congress are spending wildly, and "this causes the Federal Reserve to crank up the presses printing more and more money." "So the United States dollar is being devalued resulting in the prices for our basic necessities like food and oil to rise," Hovde says. "These failed economic policies are making gas prices higher while America’s economy is running on fumes." He elaborated in an April 24, 2012 appearance at the Milwaukee Press Club. "What printing money does is it debases the currency and devalues the dollar," Hovde said. "That is why oil prices are $100 a barrel, and why gas prices are over $4. … If we don’t stop the Fed from quantitative easing, you could be looking at, within a matter of years, I’m talking about six or eight or 10 dollars for a gallon of gas." Wow. Those are startling numbers. "You can track this," Hovde said when asked for backup to his claim. "It’s written extensively about. I’m not the only out there talking about this." For a deeper look at the first-time candidate’s claims, we dialed up some experts on oil and gasoline prices. John Felmy, chief economist, American Petroleum Institute, a key oil industry trade group: Felmy said gasoline prices very closely follow the price of oil. There’s been a record level of demand for oil worldwide and some supply constraints, in part because Libya is currently not exporting oil. "It’s a tight market, and there’s not a lot of excess capacity," Felmy said, adding that gasoline prices "are driven more by overall supply and demand." He said that there was no question that a devalued dollar affected the price of oil, but he said it was more of an indirect factor: "I go back to Econ 101 and the old supply and demand curves. I tend to believe it’s really the market fundamentals." To understand the cost of a price of a gallon of gas, divide the price of a barrel of crude oil by 42 gallons -- the amount that one barrel will produce. So, at $105 a barrel, that’s $2.50 a gallon. State and local taxes add, on average, 49 cents to that. Add in the cost to refine the oil into gas, storage, shipping and profits along the way, including for the gas stations, and you’re quite close to the pump price, API spokesman Bill Bush said. Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst, Oil Price Information Service, which follows prices for groups, including AAA: "Prices rose first because of higher crude prices -- U.S. domestic crude advanced to about $110 (a barrel) and overseas sweet crudes fetched a price as high as $130." The reasons behind the prices increases include "growing consumption in emerging economies; money that has been parked (whether through passive investment or active speculation) in crude oil purchases; and worries about Iranian supply and other MENA (Middle East, North African) country issues." Kloza said that a weaker dollar "exerts upward pressure on oil, since all oil transactions are priced in dollars." Pam Moen, spokeswoman for AAA Wisconsin: Many experts blamed rising tensions with Iran over that country’s nuclear program. "If this were to escalate, there could be some disruption caused by Iran in the world’s oil supply," she said. Prices in the Milwaukee market were also higher than the rest of the state because the area is required to used a most-expensive "reformulated" gasoline, she said. Also, supplies tend to tighten and prices go up in late winter as refineries switch from winter to summer fuel blends. Adolfo Laurenti, deputy chief economist for Mesirow Financial, a private financial services firm in Chicago, who frequently comments on the economy: There is "no correlation between Fed actions and the price of gasoline." It’s simple supply and demand, PolitiFact Georgia wrote in 2011. Geopolitical forces on the other side of the world are a major price driver, as is the state of the global economy. Energy technology plays a role too. "It’s really complex to explain to people how energy markets work. So in campaigns people are always looking for the bumper sticker," Jay Hakes, former director of the Energy Information Administration under President Bill Clinton and author of the book "A Declaration of Energy Independence" told PolitiFact Georgia. Hovde said others have written extensively about the same link he is making, between the budget and monetary policies and gas prices. He did not point us to anything in particular. We searched and didn’t find much evidence to substantiate this claim. One oft-cited piece was a May 16, 2011 commentary produced by the staff of the Joint Economic Committee Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives. "In much the same way that one can use the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to measure the cost of living, one can index the price of oil, an international commodity, to the value of the dollar (to) measure the impact of the dollar’s declining value on the price of oil." The paper concludes that if the value of the dollar remained unchanged since the Fed began using monetary policy in 2008, "the price of oil (Brent Crude) would be $17.04 per barrel less." The paper applies the same logic to gas prices, concluding that the price of a gallon of gas is 56.5 cents higher than if the dollar had not declined. The commentary, however, doesn’t take into account any of the factors cited by other experts that affect the price of oil -- rising Mideast tensions, greater demand from China, and so forth. The committee’s staff report, was cited in numerous blogs and opinion pieces, including one published by the San Francisco Examiner on May 17, 2011 by the committee’s vice chairman, Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas. Our rating Hovde claimed that actions by Obama, Congress and the Fed’s monetary policy had devalued dollar led to higher gas prices. The candidate uses a broad brush to describe the Federal Reserve’s actions in the wake of the financial market and housing meltdown. The value of the dollar factors into the equation, but as a secondary factor. We rate Hovde’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-01003	Ronald Reagan "banned ownership of fully automatic rifles. He supported the assault weaspons ban."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2015/feb/04/alfonso-lopez/lopez-says-reagan-supported-assault-weapon-bans/	Del. Alfonso Lopez recently conjured the spirit of Ronald Reagan in an ill-fated attempt to convince the Republican-led House of Delegates to pass gun control legislation. "In Virginia, we have a bad habit of defeating every single sensible gun violence prevention bill proposal," Lopez, D-Arlington, lamented in a Jan. 19 floor speech. "By the standards of today, Ronald Reagan was a traitor to the Second Amendment," Lopez said. The delegate added about Reagan, "As president, he banned ownership of fully automatic rifles. He supported the assault weapons ban..." We wondered whether Lopez described the Gipper’s record correctly. We asked the delegate for proof of his claim and he sent an assortment of newspaper articles, two op-ed pieces Reagan wrote after his presidency, and a 2013 Truth-O-Meter by PolitiFact Georgia on a similar claim about Reagan. Let’s start by recalling that Reagan was shot in the chest in a 1981 assassination attempt that left his press secretary, James Brady, with a gunshot wound to the head and permanent brain damage. During the rest of his administration, which ended in 1989, Reagan "often expressed opposition to national gun control laws," according to a 1994 article in The New York Times. Shortly after his shooting, he said he was "a little disturbed" that people were "focusing on gun control as an answer to the crime problem today." Lopez pointed out to us that in 1986, Reagan signed the Firearm Owners Protection Act. The bill provided a number of protections for gun owners. But it also barred the private sale and ownership of any fully automatic rifles -- machine guns -- that were not already registered with the federal government on the day Reagan signed the law. The provision, still in effect today, is not the outright ban that Lopez described. Private citizens remain free to buy and transfer machine guns that were registered prior to May 20, 1986 -- provided they pass a background check, receive signed approval from their local police chief or sheriff and pay a $200 federal tax. There are 512,790 registered machine guns in the United States, according to a 2014 report by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Virginia was home to 31,825 of them, more than any state. Now, let’s move to the assertion that Reagan also backed a ban on assault weapons, which are often described as semi-automatic firearms with detachable magazines and pistol grips. They are capable of firing many rounds without reloading, but the trigger has to be pulled for each shot. Lopez referred us to a May 1994 letter signed by Reagan and former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter urging members of the U.S. House of Representatives to to support a pending bill banning assault weapons. They wrote, "While we recognize that assault weapon legislation will not stop all assault weapon crime, statistics prove that we can dry up the supply of these guns, making them less accessible to criminals. We urge you to listen to the American public and to the law enforcement community and support a ban on the further manufacture of these weapons." Reagan also sent a personal note that month to one of the fence sitters on ban: Rep. Scott Klug, R-WI. "I know there is heavy pressure on you to go the other way, but I strongly urge you to join me in supporting this bill," he wrote. It must be passed." The measure cleared Congress, with Klug’s support, and was signed by then-President. Bill Clinton. The assault weapons ban expired in 2004 when Congress refused to extend it. We should note that since Lopez’s speech, the General Assembly has killed a number of gun control bills, including legislation by Lopez that would have restricted the sale and ownership of high-capacity firearm magazines. Our ruling Lopez said, "As president, (Reagan) banned ownership of fully automatic rifles. He supported the assault weapons ban." Lopez errs in saying Reagan banned ownership of machine guns. Reagan, in 1986, signed a law that barred the private sale and ownership of machine guns that were not already registered on the day he signed the bill. The measure stopped new machine guns from entering the private marketplace, it did not ban the old ones. Lopez is correct on the second part of his claim. In 1994, after his presidency, Reagan signed a letter urging the House to pass an assault weapons ban. On the whole, we rate Lopez’s statement as Half True.

pomt-03996	Says Texas is "last in mental health expenditures."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/feb/08/sacramento-bee-editorial-board/sacramento-bee-editorial-says-texas-last-mental-he/	Disparaging Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s pitch for California businesses to check out opportunities in his state, the Sacramento Bee editorial board said Texas ranks poorly in several ways. We’ve been sorting through the Feb. 6, 2013, editorial’s factual claims. Click here to read our collected checks. Among the claims: "Come check out a state that is last in mental health expenditures..." That’s familiar. We recently looked into the same characterization by state Sen. Wendy Davis, rating it Mostly True. Another state lagged Texas in the latest national ranking of states. Stuart Leavenworth, who edits the Bee’s editorial page, pointed us to the same source that Davis cited, a Dec. 18, 2012, news story posted by WFAA-TV, Channel 8 in Dallas, that was headlined "Texas ranks last in mental health funding." That story said Texas ranked last in the country in per-person mental health spending based on dollar amounts it attributed to the liberal, Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities. When we inquired, a center official told us they gave WFAA information about spending in fiscal 2009 as written up in an August 2012 report by the Texas-based Hogg Foundation for Mental Health. The Hogg Foundation, in turn, said its source was a listing of per-person mental health care spending data in 50 states by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. Texas was last among the states in such per-capita spending in 2009, 2008 and 2007, according to Kaiser foundation charts for those years, though the 2007 chart shows no available data for Hawaii. The latest comparison: In fiscal 2010, which in Texas ran through August 2010, Texas spent nearly $980 million total on mental health services, placing ninth nationally, according to a foundation chart. Its per-person spending of $38.99 placed the state 49th -- not last -- among the states. Idaho, with per-capita spending of $36.64, was 50th, with Maine No. 1 at per-capita spending of $346.92. The national average was $120.56. California was 14th among the states, at $152.60 in such spending per person. Our ruling The editorial says Texas is last in mental health spending. In 2010, the latest year analyzed, Texas spent more in raw dollars on mental health services than 41 states. But in per-resident spending -- the better metric for comparing states --Texas ranked second-to-last to Idaho after ranking last to all other states for several years.

pomt-09143	Georgia has "a dropout rate that’s higher" than Alabama's.	true	/georgia/statements/2010/jun/14/john-oxendine/oxendine-says-georgia-has-higher-dropout-rate-alab/	When gubernatorial candidate John Oxendine sought to demonstrate that Georgia's schools need help in a Web site campaign video, he made a striking claim. He said Georgia's students were doing worse than Alabama's. "As a parent of four children, three of them in school, I’m very concerned about our schools," he said. "We have SAT school scores lower than that of Alabama, yet a dropout rate that’s higher. We need to make some serious changes in how we address education.” Georgians think they should beat Alabama any day. In everything. Graduation rates, SAT scores. (Not that we do. Consider, for instance, the Bulldogs' football record against the Crimson Tide.) For the sake of state pride, we will verify Oxendine's claims. An earlier PolitiFact Georgia item rated Oxendine's statement on SAT scores as Half True. This item deals with his statement about dropouts. Calculating dropout rates is tricky. This measure tends to undercount students who don't finish school, said Chris Swanson, vice president for research and development with Editorial Projects in Education, the nonprofit group that publishes the education news and policy magazine Education Week. Instead, experts tend to rely on another measure: the graduation rate. This is the percentage of students who receive their diplomas on time. Graduation rates are more widely available and consistent, he said. Making a fair comparison between states is even more difficult. Few groups publish graduation rates that are comparable between states. Swanson's group does. So does the National Center for Education Statistics, which collects and publishes data for the U.S. Department of Education. Oxendine's statement avoids both of these pitfalls. Although he used the word "dropout," Oxendine's claim is actually based upon graduation rates, according to his campaign manager. His data come from the National Center for Education Statistics. For the past 13 years, average secondary-school graduation rates have been lower in Georgia than Alabama. In the 2006-2007 school year, the most recent time period available, Georgia graduated 64.1 percent. Alabama graduated 67.1. Figures from Editorial Projects in Education also show that Georgia lags behind Alabama. Its 2009 report states that the rate of Georgia students finishing high school with a regular diploma is 55.9 percent. Alabama's is at 61.4 percent. Indeed, Alabama beats Georgia. We rate Oxendine's statement as True.	None	John Oxendine	None	None	None	2010-06-14T06:00:00	2010-06-04	['Alabama']
pomt-06250	In Pennsylvania, President Barack Obama’s policies have increased unemployment 19 percent, led to the loss of 37,900 manufacturing jobs, and left 189,000 more people in poverty.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/30/republican-national-committee-republican/republican-national-committee-web-video-attacks-ba/	As President Barack Obama headed to Scranton, Pa., to push for an extension of a payroll tax break on Nov. 30, 2011, the Republican National Committee released a 30-second Web video criticizing him for the economy’s performance on his watch. The ad aired audio clips of a candidate Obama visit to Scranton on March 31, 2008, when he was engaged in a tight primary battle with Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. As the ad shows images of shuttered factories, Obama talks about the nation’s economic difficulties. Several phrases appear on the screen: "In 2008 … he promised Pennsylvanians hope & change … Today: Unemployment up 19% … 37,900 Pennsylvania manufacturing jobs lost … 189,000 more Pennsylvanians in poverty … Failed promises. Change direction." We’ll take the easy ones first, then take up the complicated one. Unemployment in Pennsylvania is up 19 percent. Making comparisons like these can be a bit confusing, because it’s easy to mix up percentage points and percents. But the number is accurate. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Pennsylvania’s unemployment rate in January 2009 was 6.8 percent, while its rate in October 2011 was 8.1 percent. That’s an increase of 1.3 percentage points, but that can also be expressed as an increase of 19 percent above the initial level. We should point out that Pennsylvania unemployment is actually down by seven-tenths of a point from its peak of 8.8 percent between January 2010 to April 2010. Expressed the way the ad did it, that means unemployment has fallen by 8 percent since its peak. But we have no quibble with the RNC’s methodology. There are 189,000 more Pennsylvanians in poverty. According to the Census Bureau, the number of Pennsylvanians in poverty rose from 1,335,000 in 2008 (the final year before Obama took office) to 1,521,000 in 2010 (the last year for which data is available). That’s a difference of 186,000 -- close enough in our book to the 189,000 cited in the ad. 37,900 Pennsylvania manufacturing jobs were lost. According to state employment statistics compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number is correct. Between January 2009, when Obama took office, and October 2011, the most recent month for which state figures are available, Pennsylvania did indeed lose 37,900 manufacturing jobs. But that isn’t the end of the story. For starters, it’s PolitiFact’s policy not to focus solely on the accuracy of the numbers in political attacks (or, conversely, efforts to claim political credit) but also to determine whether blame or credit for the results is justified. (This policy applies to all three statistics in this ad.) For job-creation and job-loss claims, we have ruled that politicians’ policies are just one factor in employment levels, making even statistically accurate claims something less than True on our Truth-O-Meter. However, the suggestion that manufacturing jobs have declined due to Obama’s policies is even more questionable than most job-related claims we’ve reviewed. As we have noted earlier, the nation’s manufacturing activity has fallen off a cliff over the past 50 years. This stems from countless reasons, ranging from the expansion of free trade to educational attainment patterns to the emergence of new sectors such as information technology. In January 1960, manufacturing jobs accounted for 29 percent of U.S. employment. By March 2011, that had fallen by about two-thirds, to just 9 percent. And in Pennsylvania, the number of manufacturing jobs has fallen by 40 percent since January 1990, the oldest data available for the state on the BLS Website. Based on this context, we think it’s a stretch to blame Obama for the decline in manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania since January 2009. But the claim is even more problematic if you look at how manufacturing in Pennsylvania fared under Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush. Between the time Bush took office in January 2001 and the time he left in January 2009, the number of Pennsylvania manufacturing jobs fell by 244,900. Dividing by Bush’s eight years in the White House, that works out to an annual decline of 30,613 manufacturing jobs. Yet taking the decline under Obama and dividing that by 2.83 years in office works out to 13,376 manufacturing jobs lost per year -- or less than half the rate of decline under Bush. In other words, during the worst economic conditions since the Great Depression, Pennsylvania manufacturing job losses declined less than half as quickly under Obama as under Bush. This clashes with the overall message of the ad, which is that Obama economic policies have failed Pennsylvania, and -- judging by the ad’s imagery -- its manufacturing sector in particular. This may not offer much solace for the Obama camp -- it’s hard to crow, "The Pennsylvania manufacturing sector eroded more slowly on our watch than it did under our predecessor!" -- but we do think it’s important context to point out. Our rating The ad gets all of its numbers right, but it overreaches by holding Obama fully accountable for these trends. In particular, the RNC’s manufacturing jobs statistic ignores both a decades-long national and state decline in manufacturing jobs and the fact that the rate of manufacturing job losses in Pennsylvania during Obama’s presidency was slower than the rate of job losses under his predecessor, George W. Bush. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.	None	Republican National Committee	None	None	None	2011-11-30T16:24:23	2011-11-30	['Pennsylvania', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-04597	"Redistribution" has "never been a characteristic of America."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/20/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-redistribution-has-never-been-cha/	After getting criticized for saying that 47 percent of Americans are "dependent on government" and "believe the government has a responsibility to care for them," Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign fired back by accusing President Barack Obama of supporting redistribution of wealth. First, a 1998 tape of Obama surfaced in which he said, in part, "I actually believe in redistribution, at least at a certain level to make sure that everybody's got a shot." Then, Romney brought up the topic during a Sept. 19, 2012, appearance in Atlanta. Romney said that Obama "really believes in what I’ll call a government-centered society," according to an account in POLITICO. "I know there are some who believe that if you simply take from some and give to others then we’ll all be better off. It’s known as redistribution. It’s never been a characteristic of America. There’s a tape that came out just a couple of days ago where the president said yes he believes in redistribution. I don’t. I believe the way to lift people and help people have higher incomes is not to take from some and give to others but to create wealth for all." Romney continued, "This idea of redistribution follows from the idea that if you have a business you didn’t build it, someone else did that. It’s the same concept. … The government is responsible for everything that’s gone on here. And therefore government can take and give as it chooses. It’s an entirely foreign concept that will not work, that has not worked. That has never worked anywhere in the world. And what we have to do in America is not to make us more like Europe, but to make America more like America...." We wondered whether Romney was correct to say that "redistribution" has "never been a characteristic of America." So we checked with historians and economists. Most agreed that Romney was ignoring the fundamental structure of the nation's progressive tax system, which has been redistributing wealth for a century, as well as a host of other policies, some of which predate the nation’s founding. A progressive tax system is one that takes a larger share of the income of high-income earners than it does from low-income individuals. Since this revenue is spent on government programs -- which benefit people other than just the taxpayer whose income is taken -- a progressive tax system is essentially by definition redistributive. Indeed, the U.S. system, at least if you look at the official rates, has been far more redistributive in the past than it is now, with a top federal income tax rate of 35 percent. Just looking at some previous Republican presidents, the top tax rate was over 50 percent under Warren Harding, over 60 percent under Herbert Hoover, over 90 percent for Dwight Eisenhower’s entire term, 70 percent or higher for Nixon’s entire term, and 70 percent under Gerald Ford, said said Daniel N. Shaviro, professor of taxation at New York University Law School. (Shaviro has written in his blog that he supports Obama over Romney.) And once this money comes into the federal treasury, it’s quickly redistributed. As we have noted previously, some states send more money to the federal treasury than they get back, while some states receive more money than they put in. The Tax Foundation, a business-backed group, crunched the numbers back in 2007 and reported that New Mexico got $2.03 for every dollar it sent to Washington, while New Jersey got just 61 cents. The approach of redistribution dates back to colonial times, when the colonies levied property taxes on landholders. Since not everyone owned land, but because everyone benefited from at least some of the fruits of that revenue, such taxes were inherently redistributional. Not to suggest that Americans were always happy about this. "Settlers far from markets complained that taxing land on a per-acre basis was unfair and demanded that property taxation be based on value," wrote Glenn W. Fisher, an emeritus public administration professor at Wichita State University. Indeed, early efforts to expand infrastructure such as roads and canals -- championed in the 1820s by Sen. Henry Clay -- stumbled over disputes over using general taxpayer money to fund projects with local benefits. Later, subsidies for building transcontinental railroads began in the 1860s but eventually devolved into major corruption scandals. Such funding was, in effect, a redistribution from the public to big business. In the second half of the 19th century and the first part of the 20th century, the government added one redistributive program after another -- Civil War benefits and a veterans’ health system took money from the young and gave it to the old; public education and land-grant colleges took money from the old and gave it to the young. Social Security redistributed money from workers to retirees, while agricultural subsidies redistributed funds from non-farmers to farmers. "You could argue that a true welfare state didn’t take shape until the New Deal, but even that was 80 years ago, so it doesn’t support the claim that redistribution has ‘never’ been characteristic of America," said Rutgers University historian David Greenberg. "The notion that redistribution is some recent, Obama-led fanaticism, as opposed to a normal, reasonable, widely accepted way of running a large, complex nation, is just silly." Peter Lindert, an economist at the University of California at Davis, says redistribution is an essential function of any government. "At the most profound level, any choice about how to run a country redistributes well-being from some to others," he said. Several experts we interviewed cautioned that while Romney’s claim is factually incorrect, it’s important not to overlook his larger point -- that too much redistribution can be a bad thing. Douglas J. Besharov, a University of Maryland public policy professor, said that because America has generated so much upward mobility over the years, redistributing too much will "kill the goose that lays the golden egg." And Dan Mitchell, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute, said that "we have income-based redistribution in our means-tested programs and, to a lesser extent, age-based redistribution in our social insurance programs, but we're not Europe." Mitchell added, however, that "we are heading that direction, which Romney, in his typically inarticulate fashion, was trying to explain." Still, on Romney’s specific claim that "redistribution" has "never been a characteristic of America," experts agreed that he ignores longstanding fundamentals of our system of taxing and spending. "Not to sound intemperate here, but the claim is completely ridiculous and false," said Shaviro, the NYU tax professor. "This goes way beyond hyperbole. Romney is trying to rewrite and falsify U.S. history." Our ruling Romney said that "redistribution" has "never been a characteristic of America." Reasonable people can disagree about the wisdom of it, but redistribution has been a basic principle of the U.S. tax system and many federal programs, including some such as veterans benefits that have long attracted support from Republicans.

pomt-08287	"In fact, 85 percent of Oregonians voted in 2008."	false	/oregon/statements/2010/nov/05/democratic-party-oregon/eighty-five-percent-oregonians-voted-2008/	This time of year, voting is right up there with picking up litter and adopting kittens as far as civic duties go. In fact, PolitiFact Oregon found this get-out-the-vote reminder distributed to homes on Tuesday, courtesy of the Democratic Party of Oregon. "VOTE," read the flier. "Your community knows exactly how important it is to vote. In fact, 85 percent of Oregonians voted in 2008. Thank you for your participation this year." At first, PolitiFact Oregon was elated. Who knew Oregon took its ballot duty that seriously? But then, we became suspicious. Isn’t 25 percent of the population here under 18? How could it be then that 85 percent of Oregonians voted in 2008? So, onward to the fact checking. First the numbers. There were more than 3.7 million people in Oregon as of July 2007. Obviously, the DPO didn’t mean to claim that babies cast ballots, so let’s whittle the number down to just eligible voters -- 2.8 million is what the secretary of state’s office estimated. Precisely 1,845,251 people cast ballots in the fall 2008 election. Multiply 2.8 million by 85 percent (0.85) and you get nearly 2.4 million people -- which is way more than the 1.8 million who actually voted. So what gives? Well, it turns out that 85 percent of registered voters cast ballots in the 2008 presidential election. Not everyone who is eligible to vote actually registered to vote. In fact, according to the Secretary of State’s website, only 77 percent of eligible adults registered and of that figure, 85 percent cast ballots. Which brings the overall figure to 66 percent. That’s pretty good -- but not 85 percent good. To be fair, Oregon has long used this calculation to measure electoral participation of registered voters, which Oregon elections officials refer to as "turnout," but no one with a straight face extrapolates that to say that means "85 percent of Oregonians voted." Also, not everyone measures turnout the same way. The United States Elections Project, for example, run by an associate professor atGeorge Mason University, uses as its base eligible voters to measure turnout, not registered voters. According to the elections project, 68.1 percent of eligible Oregonians voted in 2008. That’s on the high end, and it’s higher than the 62.2 percent cited nationally. Minnesota, apparently, can claim the title of most vote-happy state, with turnout at 78 percent two years ago; on the other hand, Hawaii, at 50.8 percent, just wasn’t into it. Oregon did have a fairly high voter participation rate in 2008. If the flier had said that Oregon’s turnout in 2008 was 85 percent, or that 85 percent of voters cast a ballot that year, we wouldn’t have a problem with the claim. But to say that 85 percent of Oregonians voted in 2008 is just plain inaccurate. We rate the claim False. Comment on this item.

pomt-10552	John McCain "said publicly that Hillary Clinton would make a good president."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/14/james-dobson/mccain-knew-it-would-get-him-in-trouble/	James Dobson, an evangelical leader who founded the conservative Christian group Focus on the Family, says he cannot support Sen. John McCain. He has gone so far as to say he will not vote for the first time in his life this November if McCain is the Republican nominee. In a statement read by Laura Ingraham on her radio show, Dobson attacked McCain's conservative credentials, specifically his collegiality with Democrats. Dobson emphasized that the statement was his personal opinion, not that of Focus on the Family. "I am convinced Sen. McCain is not a conservative, and in fact, has gone out of his way to stick his thumb in the eyes of those who are," the statement reads. "He has at times sounded more like a member of the other party. McCain actually considered leaving the GOP in 2001, and approached John Kerry about being Kerry's running mate in 2004. McCain also said publicly that Hillary Clinton would make a good president. Given these and many other concerns, a spoonful of sugar does not make the medicine go down. I cannot, and I will not vote for Sen. John McCain, as a matter of conscience." We've addressed a claim on McCain being considered as a running mate to John Kerry here. So we'll focus on Dobson's claim that McCain once said Sen. Clinton would make a good president. According to a transcript of Meet the Press, Dobson is right. Wrapping up a Feb. 20, 2005, appearance from Baghdad during a joint trip, the senators praised each other in a light-hearted exchange. McCain even ended the interview by acknowledging what trouble he'd gotten into. Russert: "Senator McCain, a serious question: Do you think the lady to your right would make a good president?" Clinton: "Oh, we can't hear you, Tim. We can't hear you." McCain: "Yeah, you're breaking up. I am sure that Senator Clinton would make a good president. I happen to be a Republican and would support, obviously, a Republican nominee, but I have no doubt that Senator Clinton would make a good president." Russert: "Equal time, Senator Clinton. The gentleman to your left?" Clinton: "Absolutely." Russert: "We may have a fusion ticket right here." McCain: "Thanks for doing that to us. Thanks for doing that to us, Tim." No spin in that exchange. We judge Dobson's statement to be True.	None	James Dobson	None	None	None	2008-02-14T00:00:00	2008-02-05	['John_McCain', 'Hillary_Rodham_Clinton']
pomt-13645	"Mike Pence voted against expanding the Children’s Health Insurance program, which Hillary helped to start."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/08/howard-dean/howard-dean-largely-right-mike-pences-health-polic/	Speakers at the Democratic National Convention made clear their disdain for GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean did just that but also managed to attack Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, on his health policy record. In the speech, Dean said that Trump would "rip up Obamacare." He continued by saying, "His vice presidential pick is no better. Mike Pence voted against expanding the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which Hillary helped to start," among other claims about Pence's health care policy positions. We decided to look into Dean's statement about Pence and the Children's Health Insurance Program, called CHIP. Is Dean's statement accurate? Pence on the Children’s Health Insurance Program The Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, was first created by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 under Bill Clinton’s administration. According to Medicaid, it has insured over 8 million low-income children who could not afford private coverage. The Hillary Clinton campaign has touted her role in passing the legislation. While she did play a significant part from the White House, others were pivotal in moving it through the Republican-controlled Congress, notably the late Sen. Ted Kennedy. We've rated the statement that she helped get the program "done" as Mostly True. So, did Pence vote against the legislation? Pence served in Congress from 2001 to 2012. During that time, there were four major roll call votes directly affecting CHIP. Children’s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007: The bill sought to extend the program and increase its funding. Pence voted no. After being passed in both chambers, it was vetoed by President Bush. In the vote to override the veto, Pence voted no again. Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009: During the Obama administration, the bill was passed. The legislation marked significant expansion of the program’s funding, including new programming and incentives for states to increase enrollment. Pence voted no. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010: The health-related parts of these two bills combine to form what is commonly known as the Affordable Care Act. The bills extended CHIP funding for another two years. Pence voted no on both. Although Pence did not vote in favor of the reauthorization proposals in 2007 or 2009, he did offer statements on the legislation. In an editorial for the Star Press in Indiana, Pence wrote that while he supports expanding health insurance for poor children, the Democratic legislation "represented a massive expansion of this anti-poverty program into the middle class." Instead of the CHIP reauthorizations, Pence had supported other bills like the More Children, More Choices Act of 2007, which expand coverage but use tax credits. Dean’s assertion that Pence voted against CHIP is accurate, though Pence did support Republican legislation to get health care to low-income children. Pence in Indiana We should note that Pence's health care record isn't entirely against the Democratic policy agenda. While Dean attacked Pence’s congressional record, Pence’s most notable healthcare-related policies have come during his time as governor of Indiana. The state is known for the Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP), which many have called a compromise between Obamacare and conservative health policy ideas. HIP expanded the state’s Medicaid coverage by using federal dollars, which is now optional for states since a 2012 Supreme Court ruling. While adopting provisions of the Affordable Care Act, Indiana expanded Medicaid through a waiver plan, allowing the state to add additional stipulations and restrictions. Particularly contentious is HIP’s premium contribution requirement, which forces Medicaid recipients to pay a small premium each month. If people fail to pay, they are locked out of benefits for six months. Sherry Glied, professor of public service at New York University with an extensive background in health policy, notes that the benefits of Indiana’s Medicaid expansion "include the same essential benefits required under Obamacare for all individual market and Medicaid plans, among them mental health and substance use benefits." So, although Dean is largely correct about Pence’s voting record on CHIP in Congress, Pence’s policies as governor have added other benefits at the state level. Our ruling Dean criticized Pence’s health policy record, saying, "Mike Pence voted against expanding the Children’s Health Insurance program,which Hillary helped to start." That claim is largely accurate. Pence voted against CHIP when he was in Congress, and Clinton did have a role in starting the program when she was First Lady. But it is important to note that Pence has supported health policy as governor of Indiana that was in line with health policies that Dean and other Democrats support. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Howard Dean	None	None	None	2016-08-08T10:51:14	2016-07-26	['Hillary_Rodham_Clinton', 'Mike_Pence']
pomt-09777	The Obama administration is "cutting back on defense"	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/25/sean-hannity/hannity-says-obama-cutting-back-defense/	During an interview with Sen. John McCain, Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity closed by asking the former Republican presidential candidate whether President Barack Obama was getting soft on defense. "Do you think the president is adopting a pre-9/11 mentality?" Hannity asked McCain. "I know those are pretty strong words, but I believe he is. I believe he is weakening our national reaction. I think if you look at Gitmo, Mirandizing enemy combatants, cutting back on defense, you know, slowing down our nuclear. It seems to me it's beyond the pre-9/11 mentality." For this item we'll focus on just one of Hannity's assertions: that Obama is "cutting back on defense." After speaking to several defense budget experts, we've found a clear consensus on that question: maybe. Hannity did not include a time frame or provide qualifiers, so we need to look at his claim by examining some different ways to measure defense spending: -- The base budget vs. the war budget . Anyone looking at the defense budget must consider two main numbers. One is the base budget, which includes most everything outside of direct war spending. The second is war spending. To compare apples to apples, our sources advised us to stick to the base budget. That avoids lots of budgetary volatility, since war spending can quickly spike or decline depending on the needs on the front lines. The base budget, by contrast, is a more stable indicator of Obama's priorities. Comparing Obama's fiscal year 2010 base budget request for defense to the 2009 fiscal year (which was funded under President Bush) shows an increase from $513.4 billion to $533.8 billion — a jump of 3.9 percent. That's certainly not a cut, and if the budget for 2010 were the only measurement considered, Hannity would be flat-out wrong to say the budget is decreasing. (We should point out that the fiscal year 2010 number includes a one-time shift into the base budget of some items that had been categorized under the war budget during the administration of President George W. Bush. This shift effectively increases the base budget by about $13 billion without affecting how much money is spent on those items. However, even subtracting the newly shifted amount from the fiscal year 2010 increase, the base budget still increased from one year to year the next, so it would not be correct to call that year's change a cut.) And President Obama has proposed that the base budget will continue to rise in absolute dollars through 2014, though by smaller percentages. For fiscal year 2011, it rises by 1.5 percent; for fiscal year 2012, it rises by 1.6 percent; for 2013, it rises by 1.9 percent; and for 2014, it rises by 2.4 percent. Again, using this factor, Hannity would be wrong to say that Obama is cutting defense. -- But what about inflation ? Is it possible for an increase in spending to actually be a cut? In the topsy-turvy world of Washington wonkery, it's possible — if inflation rises more quickly than spending. In the case of the 2009 to 2010 comparison we cited above, experts say inflation is currently so low that it's unlikely to make much of a dent in that increase. Generally, though, inflation plays a significant role. Michael O'Hanlon of the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution wrote in a June 10, 2009, op-ed that under Obama, the average increase in the base defense budget between 2010 and 2014 would be about 2 percent a year, which in his view translates into "no real growth" because that increase would be largely eaten up by inflation. "The administration is hardly slashing funds for defense; it is simply adopting a policy of zero real growth in the base budget," he wrote. "With the inflation rate expected to average over 1.5 percent, the net effect is essentially no real growth. Cumulatively, that would leave us about $150 billion short of actual funding requirements through 2014." Making the problem worse is that inflation for defense costs is traditionally higher than inflation for the economy as a whole. "The cost of almost everything we've been doing in defense has been accelerating upward too fast even for growing budgets to keep up," said Stephen Daggett, a defense specialist with the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, in congressional testimony he gave in February 2009. Daggett and O'Hanlon agree that such increases have been driven by personnel costs, including health care and benefits; operations and maintenance; purchases of increasingly complex equipment; and efforts to reorient the military branches to new threats. In other words, just to keep pace, defense spending should really run a couple percentage points higher than general inflation — and under the Obama blueprint, it probably would not do that. (By contrast, during the Bush years of 2001 to 2009, the base defense budget grew at an average real rate of 4.6 percent annually, according to Todd Harrison of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments .) If you factor inflation into the equation, then, Obama is effectively decreeing a slowing of the rate of growth. Hannity could certainly make a case that this amounts to a cut even though Obama is still increasing spending on a year-to-year basis. -- How big is the defense budget compared to gross domestic product ? Another measure of defense spending is to compare it to the United States' gross domestic product. According to Mackenzie Eaglen of the conservative Heritage Foundation, the Obama defense budget drops from 3.81 percent of GDP in 2010 to 3.01 percent in 2019. These calculations are always iffy because it's hard to predict GDP a full 10 years out — and the decrease could result from an expansion in the economy rather than a fall in defense spending. But if this measure were used, Hannity could argue with some legitimacy that this amounts to a defense cut. -- Do cuts of particular programs count ? Setting aside what's happening with the defense budget as a whole, the administration is clearly making specific cuts in programs. The administration has said it would cut such programs as the F-22 fighter, the DDG-1000 destroyer, parts of the Army's Future Combat System, the presidential helicopter fleet, aircraft carrier production runs, the airborne laser missile defense program and the next-generation bomber. These certainly qualify as "cuts" by the strictest definition of the word, but a more appropriate description might be that they represent a reshuffling of priorities. "These are specific cuts, but they are balanced by increases in other areas," said Harrison of CSBA. "The cuts to specific programs get a lot of attention, but the additions to others don't." In our view, the cutting of specific weapons programs doesn't count as "cutting back on defense" as long as the defense budget is increasing as a whole. So if Hannity was using specific program cuts as his yardstick, his assertion about Obama's defense budget would be unfair. Now it's time to recap. By some measurements, including defense spending as a percentage of GDP, Hannity is right that Obama is "cutting" defense. But from 2009 to 2010, the Obama administration is increasing the defense budget, and for a few years after that, he's increasing it in absolute terms (albeit at a slower rate than expected inflation). So whether Hannity is accurate depends on what measurement you use. We're rating his assertion Half True.	None	Sean Hannity	None	None	None	2009-09-25T13:12:44	2009-09-22	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-04376	Says an arts tax would provide "funding for certified arts and music teachers for every elementary school serving Portland residents."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2012/oct/19/creative-advocacy-network/would-portland-arts-tax-put-art-or-music-teacher-e/	The proposed Portland tax for the arts is nothing if not divisive. Supporters say the tax will mean having arts educators in every city elementary school, as well as better access to the arts throughout Portland. Detractors have called the tax poorly structured and say it uses children as a front for a plan to move money into already well-established institutions. The $35-a-person tax, which would collect some $12 million, actually goes to two different areas. About 70 percent of the money would be distributed to Portland-area school districts to help hire art and music teachers and to K-12 arts programs. The remaining funds would go to the Regional Arts and Culture Council for distribution among Portland arts organizations, such as the Oregon Symphony and the Portland Art Museum, which would use the money to offer publicly accessible art programming. To be sure, the money for schools seems to be the political campaign's primary selling point. On its website, the pro-tax Schools and Arts Together says the tax would "restore arts and music education in Portland's six school districts by providing stable, long-term funding for certified arts and music teachers for every elementary school serving Portland residents." And Jessica Jarrat Miller, executive director of the Creative Advocacy Network, which proposed the tax, asserted something similar during a September radio interview: "If we pass this measure, we will be able to fund teachers to make sure that every elementary school in our city has certified art instruction." And yet, a recent article in Willamette Week partly challenged that assertion. The weekly quoted former Emily Nazarov, the Portland organizer of Stand for Children, as saying the organization had "some serious concerns whether the measure will deliver on its promise of music and art teachers in every school." PolitiFact Oregon decided to check. Under the measure and an associated inter-governmental agreement, each district would get funding for one art or music teacher for every 500 elementary students. In return, the district agrees to have one full-time art or music teacher in each elementary school. That works fine for the David Douglas School District. Dan McCue, the spokesman for the district, told us that David Douglas has nine eligible elementary schools -- and would get enough money for nine art or music teachers. As it stands now, each of the elementary schools already has a full-time music teacher, so the art tax money "would be used to preserve those positions." But the formula falls apart if a district has some schools that are smaller than 500 students. Consider Portland Public Schools, the largest of the Portland districts. The district has 58 elementary schools -- but according to the 500-student formula, would receive funding for only 44 or 45 full-time positions. That means, should the tax pass, the district would have to find the money for the additional 13 or 14 teachers. We spoke with David Wynde, the district's deputy chief financial officer, to see if we understood the situation correctly. He confirmed we did. That would still represent some relief for the budget, he said. This year, PPS is funding 32 full-time arts or music positions. We called Jarrat Miller to see if she could explain how the tax would restore "arts for every Portland elementary school," as one mailer put it, if some districts were actually pitching in supplemental cash? "It's been widely misrepresented and confused," Jarrat Miller said. For Portland Public, she said, it's true that the tax would only provide 44 or 45 full-time teaching positions. It's equally true that, at least for the first year, PPS has agreed to pay for 13 additional full-time art or music teachers to make sure that every school has at least one. However, she said, the inter-governmental agreement – though not finalized – has been revised to say that if the district faces a financial hardship, the city of Portland would figure out a way to avoid cutting off the money. The bottom line, Jarrat Miller said, is that "nobody is forcing the district to do anything they can't do." In the event that Portland Public Schools had no money to commit to art instruction, the 45 teachers would still be more than the district is currently providing, she said. Those teachers would likely split their time among all 58 elementary schools. While 58 teachers is better, 45 would be enough to give all students art or music education once a week. The 500-to-one ratio, for what it's worth, was selected based on national student-teacher-ratio averages. "It's not a whole body that matters; it's how much education the kids are getting... that's what the ballot measure insists on," Jarrat Miller said. Wynde, the Portland Public financial officer, said he believed the additional language provided the district with the flexibility to renegotiate if funding becomes unstable. Nazarov, the local organizer for Stand for Children, seemed slightly less convinced. She said the organization was pleased that the inter-governmental agreement had been amended but thought the languageshould be more explicit in protecting the money. School and Arts Together has said that the arts tax would provide "funding for certified arts and music teachers for every elementary school serving Portland residents." It does accomplish this goal; however there are some important details that are missing –perhaps most glaringly, this idea that some districts would have to kick in money to ensure that each school has a full-time art or music teacher. Now, it's true that, in the case of financial hardship, this part of the measure could be renegotiated. But it's not clear what defines financial hardship or how those negotiations would take place -- and the inter-governmental agreement is still being drafted. Even if we assume that the funding would continue, it wouldn't be a full-time teacher in each school. We agree that it's not the body that matters so much as the amount of instructional time. But we also feel that most people voting on this tax imagine that, with it, districts would be getting enough cash to put a full-time art or music teacher in each elementary school – and that's not necessarily the case. We rate this claim Half True.	None	Creative Advocacy Network	None	None	None	2012-10-19T16:52:40	2012-09-21	['Portland,_Oregon']
pomt-08336	"Most" of the newspapers that endorsed Alex Sink also endorsed Barack Obama.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/oct/28/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-most-newspapers-endorsed-sink-also/	During a debate with the candidates for Florida governor on Oct. 25, 2010, Republican Rick Scott and Democrat Alex Sink argued over newspaper endorsements. Sink said that she received the endorsements of 16 Florida newspapers: "Every single newspaper that has endorsed has endorsed my candidacy, because they know that I have the character and the integrity, and they also know that I have the business plan, that I'm a fiscal conservative to carry our state forward in a matter that all Floridians can be proud of." Later in the debate, Scott jeered back: "You talked about your endorsements by the newspapers. Absolutely, most of them endorsed Barack Obama. You're an Obama liberal. That's exactly why they're endorsing you." Another reason, of course, is that Scott has turned down requests to meet with newspaper editorial boards, so he didn't seek their endorsements anyway. Without buying into Scott's claim that Alex Sink = Obama liberal, we still wanted to fact-check whether most of the newspapers that endorsed Sink endorsed Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential campaign. Florida is usually considered a swing state, so we wondered if the endorsements lined up as Scott claimed. We looked up endorsements from 16 newspapers Sink mentioned. We also looked up two others: The Daytona Beach News-Journal no longer endorses candidates for office, saying that the paper instead preferred "to emphasize the independence of our news operation and its credibility in covering elections." The Lakeland Ledger endorsed Sink two days after the Oct. 25 debate, so we're not including it in our analysis. However, it also endorsed Obama in 2008. Our next task was to determine which of the 16 newspapers that endorsed Sink at the time of the debate also endorsed Obama. We determined that nine of 16 newspapers endorsed both Sink and Obama, including the St. Petersburg Times, the Miami Herald, the Orlando Sentinel and the Palm Beach Post. We found that three newspapers endorsed Sink this year and Republican John McCain for president in 2008: The Tampa Tribune, the Bradenton Herald, and the Spanish-language Miami-based Diario Las Americas. The remaining four newspapers endorsed Sink, but declined to endorse a candidate for president in 2008. Those papers were the Citrus County Chronicle, the Florida Times-Union in Jacksonville, the Fort Myers News-Press and the Tallahassee Democrat. (The Tallahassee Democrat has a policy of endorsing only local candidates.) One newspaper specifically mentioned Scott's charge that Sink is an "Obama liberal." The South Florida Sun Sentinel wrote, "Scott likes to tar Sink as an Obama liberal. The truth is Sink's economic platform is pro-business, and she hasn't been campaigning with the president. She doesn't have to. She's smart and accomplished enough to run on her own record." Here, we're steering clear of Scott's charge, but fact-checking his claim that "most" of the newspapers that endorsed Sink also endorsed Obama. We found that nine of 16 endorsed Obama. That's 56 percent. That's a bit shy of "most" -- it's a bare majority. Still, we find that enough newspapers endorsed both Sink and Obama that we rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-13330	Says state Sen. Morgan Carroll's votes made "it easier to sue doctors, small businesses, even nurses. Putting her own shady interests first."	false	/colorado/statements/2016/oct/05/mike-coffman/coffman-falsely-says-carroll-voted-make-it-easier-/	Colorado Republican Rep. Mike Coffman pulls no punches in an ad accusing his Democratic opponent, Morgan Carroll, of using her role as a state senator to benefit her "shady interests" as a trial lawyer. "Meet Morgan Carroll, state senator, who’s also Morgan Carroll, personal injury lawyer," the narrator says in the ad that aired Sept. 20. "Morgan Carroll the lawyer has worked for some of the sleaziest firms in the state. And they love frivolous lawsuits." The ad shows photos of Carroll on billboards next to slimy-looking lawyers. The narrator says the state senator’s votes resulted in "making it easier to sue doctors, small businesses, even nurses. Putting her own shady interests first." Coffman’s radio version of the ad goes further, accusing Carroll of "using her position in the state Senate to line her own pockets" and speaking about an "odor of corruption," the Denver Post reported. We took a hard look at Coffman’s TV ad claim that Carroll's votes resulted in "making it easier to sue doctors, small businesses, even nurses"to serve her "shady interests." Carroll became an attorney in 2000, and spent the first decade of her career working with her mother. Their firm mostly represented clients with disabilities, Carroll campaign spokesman Drew Godinich told PolitiFact. In an ad of her own, Carroll recalls that she was a girl when her dad was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease and she watched him get sicker as medical costs wiped out his retirement savings. "It's why I've dedicated my career to fighting for people with disabilities, helping people stay in their homes and receive the care they need," she says. More recently, Carroll worked for two big personal injury law firms whose TV commercials are well-known to Coloradans. She spent two years at the Sawaya Law Firm, then moved to Bachus & Schanker. The Bachus & Schanker website says, "Morgan Carroll specializes in representing people in personal injury, Workers' Compensation, Social Security Disability and employment law." Godinich said Carroll primarily was doing legal research at the firm until about four months ago when she took time off to devote herself to the race against Coffman for Colorado’s 6th Congressional District, a crescent-ring of Denver suburbs. The Coffman ad focuses on two bills Carroll worked on. One of them is the Good Samaritans in Health Care Act of 2006, which Coffman says Carroll opposed to make it "easier to sue"doctors and nurses. The Republican-sponsored bill granted immunity from civil liability to doctors, nurses and other medical professionals who volunteer at free medical clinics to help people in need. The Coffman ad is misleading. Carroll, who at the time was a House member, voted against the bill in committee after she and the Colorado Trial Lawyers Association raised concerns that the proposed immunity was too broad and could shield a medical professional when a patient was harmed by gross negligence. However, Carroll voted for the bill after it was amended on the floor to grant immunity to medical volunteers from civil liability when an "act or omission of a volunteer" resulted in injury, except in cases of gross negligence, reckless misconduct and even violent crimes -- acts that would prevent a volunteer from receiving immunity under the federal Volunteer Protection Act. Ultimately, Carroll supported passage of the law that made it harder -- not easier -- to sue volunteer doctors, nurses and other health-medical professionals -- unless there was evidence of gross negligence. Coffman’s claim that Carroll made it easier to sue small businesses, refers to the "Job Protection and Civil Rights Enforcement Act of 2013. "Carroll was a primary sponsor of the bill. State law already allowed someone who prevailed in a complaint about employment discrimination or unfair employment practices before the Colorado Civil Rights Commission to sue for back pay, future pay, or to be reinstated or hired if they were improperly fired or denied a job. Carroll’s bill allowed victims of employment discrimination who win a lawsuit to also receive compensatory and punitive damages in cases where it was proved an employer engaged in intentional discrimination. In addition, the bill allowed an employee to be awarded attorney’s fees and costs. But if a judge found a lawsuit was frivolous -- or unjustified -- the court could award attorney’s fees and costs to the employer. The bill capped the maximum compensatory and punitive damages at $10,000 for a business with fewer than five employees, and $25,000 for an employer with five to 14 workers, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Council’s fiscal analysis. The bill and the Legislative Council noted that while federal antidiscrimination laws allow compensatory and punitive damages, those laws don’t protect workers who are discriminated against because of their sexual orientation or if their employer has fewer than 15 employees. Carroll’s state bill allowed people to seek the increased damages when their employer had less than 15 employees or there was discrimination based on sexual orientation. So the legislation, which became law, didn’t make it "easier to sue" small businesses -- people could already do that -- but it did allow people the opportunity to win greater financial damages. What about Coffman’s accusation that Carroll engaged in a conflict of interest by voting on bills that financially benefited her work as a trial lawyer? We checked the Colorado Independent Ethics Commission’s records and found no evidence of an ethics complaint having been made against Carroll. The Legislature’s ethics rules state that a lawmaker has a personal or financial interest in legislation "if the passage or failure of such bill, measure, or question will result in the member deriving a direct financial or pecuniary benefit that is greater than any such benefit derived by or shared by other persons in the member's profession, occupation, industry, or region." But a lawmaker will not be deemed to have a personal or financial interest in a bill that "affects the entire membership of a class to which the member belongs." In a part-time "citizen legislature" like Colorado’s, this generally allows a doctor/lawmaker to vote on a health care bill, a teacher to vote on an educational bill, and a builder to vote on a construction bill. Our ruling Coffman says Carroll’s votes on state legislation made "it easier to sue doctors, small businesses, even nurses. Putting her own shady interests first." Carroll voted in committee against a bill to grant immunity from civil liability to doctors, nurses and other medical professionals who volunteer at free medical clinics. But Carroll voted for the bill after it was amended on the floor to shield most medical volunteers from lawsuits — except in cases of gross negligence. Carroll did sponsor and vote for an anti-employment discrimination bill that didn’t make it easier to sue small businesses, because existing law already allowed such suits. But her bill did allow for the awarding of compensatory and punitive damages and attorney’s fees against employers of all sizes, including small businesses. Coffman accuses Carroll, who has worked as a lawyer handling disability, employment, workers’ compensation and personal injury cases, of being sleazy and shady with conflicts of interest. But there's no evidence she violated state ethics laws. We rate this claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ee3b4dca-e5bf-4630-a661-ef96890b8b02	None	Mike Coffman	None	None	None	2016-10-05T16:38:43	2016-09-20	['None']
pomt-09300	"If the space-shuttle program is terminated, Russia and China will be the only nations ...with the capability to launch humans into space."	true	/texas/statements/2010/apr/21/kay-bailey-hutchison/sen-kay-bailey-hutchison-says-if-space-shuttle-pro/	Pushing a plan that would land astronauts on Mars within the next 30 years, President Barack Obama envisions private companies ferrying American astronauts to the International Space Station until rockets are devised to reach deep space. Not thrilled: U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas and the ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. Hutchison recently blasted a budget request Obama sent to Congress that effectively dashes hopes of funding additional space shuttle flights after the last mission slated for the end of this year. The station has been orbiting Earth some two hundred miles up since 1998. "We must close the gap in U.S. human space flight or face the reality that we will be totally dependent on Russia for access to space until the next generation of space vehicle is developed," Hutchison said in a March 3 press release. "If the space shuttle program is terminated, Russia and China will be the only nations in the world with the capability to launch humans into space." Hutchison introduced legislation the same day to delay the shuttle program's retirement until the United States develops its next-generation space vehicle. "The Administration proposes to retire the shuttle as scheduled while discontinuing years of work on development of a new launch vehicle and provides no short term solution to deliver critical equipment and components to the International Space Station that are essential to extending the life of the station until 2020," according to the press release. Ground control to Moscow and Beijing? Obama has elaborated on his NASA plan since Hutchison objected. On April 15, at a White House-sponsored space conference at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Obama outlined his vision for space exploration, which included restoring a space capsule that could be used as an emergency escape vehicle for crew members on the space station. The president still wants to shelve the 30-year-old shuttle program as planned. He said, however, "we will work with a growing array of private companies competing to make getting to space easier and more affordable." The shuttle program's last flight is expected to occur in September. By 2025, under Obama's plan, the U.S. would have a spacecraft capable of carrying astronauts into deep space; trips to Mars would begin in the mid-2030s. And NASA would have until 2015 to finalize plans for a heavy-lift rocket to carry astronauts beyond the Earth's orbit. Where does that leave Hutchison's claim that if the shuttle program is shuttered, Russia and China will be the only nations capable of launching humans into space? For starters: John Yembrick, a spokesman at the NASA office of space operations, told us that between the time the space-shuttle program is set to shut down later this year until the commercial sector becomes capable of sending astronauts into orbit — lately projected at 2015 — American astronauts would travel into space on Russian spacecrafts. Next, the Senate Commerce Committee pointed us to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) website, where we brushed up on space-race history. The Soviet Union launched the first satellite to orbit Earth in 1957. Yuri Gargarin, a Russian, became the first person to travel in space in 1961; Americans Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were the first to set foot on the moon in 1969. In 2003, China sent its first astronaut into space. In 2004, test pilot Michael Melvill became the first astronaut launched into space by a private company — Scaled Composites of Mojave, California. Most U.S. astronauts work for NASA, and live and train at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston. Their Russian counterparts, cosmonauts, train near Moscow and launch from and land in Kazakhstan, the nation sharing part of Russia's southeast border. NASA launches astronauts into space aboard shuttles while cosmonauts travel aboard space vehicles called Soyuz, which, unlike the shuttles, are not reusable. Both 'nauts helped build and then worked aboard the space station. Byron Tapley, director of the Center for Space Research at the University of Texas at Austin, said other countries are striving to launch people into space, including India, Japan, Ecuador, Iran and Malaysia. "India and Japan are the most developed of this set," Tapley said. "But neither is very close to being able to claim 'current capability.' The capability for safely placing a human in orbit is much more demanding than the capability for placing a satellite in orbit." We rate Hutchison's statement as True.

pomt-04534	Says 7,000 millionaires "gamed the system to pay no income taxes."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/sep/30/tammy-baldwin/7000-millionaires-gamed-system-pay-zero-federal-in/	U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., sounds a populist theme when she says she wants all Americans to pay their fair share f taxes. It’s part of an effort to brand herself as a fighter for the middle class and to contrast herself with her U.S. Senate opponent, former Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson, whom she casts as a wealthy Washington insider. In that vein, Baldwin sent a fund-raising email to supporters Sept. 22, 2012 repeating a claim that Thompson wants to raise taxes on the middle class in order to give tax breaks to millionaires like himself. We previously rated that claim Half True- the millionaires part of Baldwin’s claim was correct, but the middle class part far less clear. In the same email, Baldwin got more specific. She claimed she "is fighting for a country where opportunity exists for everyone -- not just the 7,000 millionaires who gamed the system to pay no income taxes on their fortunes." Did 7,000 millionaires pay no income taxes because they "gamed the system"? 7,000 millionaires, no taxes Baldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus cited as evidence a table published in July 2011 by the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution in Washington. The center estimated that 7,000 households that earned "cash income" of more than $1 million in 2011 paid no federal income tax. That’s an estimate based on taxpayer data, not a hard number. Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the center, told us the center now believes the figure is 4,000 millionaires, but said he doesn't fault Baldwin for using the larger number given that the table has not been revised. The 7,000 figure has been widely cited on the Internet. As for the "cash income" measure, it includes compensation that isn’t taxable, such as employer-provided health insurance. Williams said the Tax Policy Center viewed that as a more accurate way of defining millionaires, but he acknowledged it is a broader measure than what the Internal Revenue Service uses. Indeed, that’s what The Washington Post Fact Checker found in examining the 7,000 figure in April 2012, nine months after publication of the table Baldwin relies on. If adjusted gross income -- the figure at the bottom of your 1040 tax form -- is used, 1,470 millionaires paid no federal income taxes in 2009, according to the most recent IRS figure available. According to the Tax Foundation, another Washington, D.C., research group, the figure dropped to 1,403 in 2010. As for millionaires as a class, according to the Tax Foundation, millionaires paid an effective tax rate of 25 percent and paid 22 percent of all federal income taxes collected in 2010. So, Baldwin relied on a respected group for the 7,000 figure, but the number is actually smaller, and that had been established months before she made her claim. Gaming the system The second part of Baldwin's claim -- that millionaires who paid no federal income taxes had somehow "gamed the system" -- suggests they did something improper. Kraus, Baldwin’s spokesman, provided as evidence a May 2012 news article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel about Beloit billionaire Diane Hendricks, who serves as treasurer of Thompson's campaign. The article said Hendricks paid no state income tax in 2010, which was attributed to a change in the corporate structure of a company she owned. But Baldwin's claim was about federal taxes. So at best, Kraus is off point. Williams, of the Tax Policy Center, said the roughly 1 percent of millionaires who pay no federal income taxes are able to do so because some sources of their income aren’t taxed and because of deductions provided in the tax code. Aside from employer-provided health insurance, other types of income that aren’t taxed include tax-exempt municipal bonds. In addition, some high earners, such as certain hedge fund managers, can avoid higher tax rates by receiving more of their pay as capital gains rather than earned income. Items that can reduce a millionaire’s taxes to zero include credits for taxes paid on income received in foreign nations, and deductions for charitable contributions made, as well as for state and local taxes paid. Scott Hodge, president of the Tax Foundation, agreed that foreign tax credits and deductions for charitable contributions are key reasons why some high earners pay no federal income tax. Another big reason is many of those households own businesses that suffered losses, he said. Hodge said none of those factors constitutes having "gamed the system." Indeed, when it was disclosed in September 2012 that GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney said 47 percent of Americans pay no federal income taxes, PolitiFact National rated his statement True. Utilizing Tax Policy Center research, our colleagues found that about half of people who don’t pay income taxes are simply poor, and the tax code explicitly exempts them, while the rest benefit from tax breaks. Williams said that if people feel there is something wrong with a system that allows some people to pay no income taxes, they should work to "fix the system, don’t complain about people doing perfectly legal things." Our rating Baldwin said 7,000 millionaires "gamed the system to pay no income taxes." But her figure is high and she provides no evidence that millionaires "gamed the system." What’s clear is they worked within the system, however flawed it may or may not be. We rate Baldwin’s statement False.	None	Tammy Baldwin	None	None	None	2012-09-30T09:00:00	2012-09-22	['None']
pomt-07338	"American oil production is at its highest level since 2003."	true	/virginia/statements/2011/may/11/jim-moran/jim-moran-says-us-oil-production-highest-level-03/	With gas prices averaging $3.97 a gallon in the United States, Congress is taking up energy legislation that offers good talking points, if not immediate relief at the pump. On May 5, the House passed the "Restarting Offshore Leasing Now Act," a measure aimed at forcing the Department of the Interior to auction offshore drilling leases in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of Virginia during the next year. Oil companies would bid for the leases and then build drilling rigs at the sites. The measure won virtually unanimous support from Republicans, as well as votes from 33 Democrats. But Rep. Jim Moran, D-8th, opposed the measure and criticized it in a press release. Moran said the bill was about "currying favor" with the oil industry, not cutting energy prices. He said drilling off the Virginia coast could interfere with Navy training operations. Furthermore, Moran said, "American oil production is at its highest level since 2003." We wondered if America’s oil wells are really pumping their highest output in eight years. The Energy Information Administration, part of the Department of Energy, is the clearinghouse for U.S. and global data on oil production and consumption. According to EIA data, the U.S. produced 5.5 million barrels of oil per day in 2010, up from 5.4 million barrels per day in 2009. That is indeed the highest number since 2003, when production was 5.7 million barrels per day. It’s interesting to note that U.S. production for the past decade has been below 6 million barrels a day. In the 1970s, production ranged from 8.1 million to 9.6 million barrels a day. And through most of the 1980s, it was above 8 million barrels a day. In March, after President Barack Obama made the same claim as Moran, PolitiFact’s national staff reviewed the statement. Rather than study the daily average, they reviewed the annual number of barrels produced. Here are the annual totals for barrels produced, going back to 2003. 2003: 2,073,453,000 2004: 1,983,302,000 2005: 1,890,106,000 2006: 1,862,259,000 2007: 1,848,450,000 2008: 1,811,817,000 2009: 1,956,596,000 2010: 2,011,856,000 When PolitiFact national first reviewed this claim, the EIA was expecting to see a 110,000 barrels-per-day decline in production during 2011, followed by another 200,000 barrels-per-day drop in 2012. But an updated May energy outlook projected a decline of only 20,000 barrels per day, followed by an additional 60,000 barrels per day decline in 2012. The agency said the reductions would come largely in Alaska, due to maturing oil fields, and the Gulf of Mexico. If you’re curious, U.S. demand for crude oil was about 18.8 million barrels per day during 2009 and 19.1 million barrels per day during 2010. The daily global demand for oil during 2009 was 84.3 million barrels per day, meaning the U.S. accounted for 22 percent of the world’s oil consumption that year. As we’ve reported before, the U.S. possesses about 1.5 percent of the world’s proven oil reserves. Let’s review. Moran said, "American oil production is at its highest level since 2003." He’s right that production hit a seven-year peak in 2010. The government projects a decline could be imminent. But at this point, there is no solid evidence that the decline has begun. When PolitiFact national evaluated this issue in March, the EIA was projecting a sizable production decline this year. They have since significantly lowered their projections on how much production will fall. We rate Moran’s statement True.

pomt-13998	Says Donald Trump said the U.S. should "encourage" Japan to get nuclear weapons.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/06/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-donald-trump-argued-us-should/	During a high-profile foreign policy speech, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton repeated a series of past statements by Donald Trump to show that her Republican rival poses risks for international relations. One of these past statements by Trump involved whether Japan should become a nuclear-armed state. "It's no small thing when he suggests that America should withdraw our military support for Japan, encourage them to get nuclear weapons," Clinton said in her June 2, 2016, speech. Is Clinton correct that Trump encouraged Japan to get nuclear weapons? What Trump has said As we noted earlier, Clinton’s evidence includes interviews and comments Trump has made on the campaign trail. When Trump sat for a March 26 interview with the New York Times, he was asked directly, "Would you object if (Japan) got their own nuclear arsenal, given the threat that they face from North Korea and China?" Trump responded in part, "There’ll be a point at which we’re just not going to be able to do it anymore. Now, does that mean nuclear? It could mean nuclear. It’s a very scary nuclear world. Biggest problem, to me, in the world, is nuclear, and proliferation. At the same time, you know, we’re a country that doesn’t have money." Let’s set aside Trump’s internal inconsistency -- saying that Japan might need nuclear weapons, and then, just seconds later, saying that the world’s "biggest problem" is nuclear proliferation. If you read his words closely, Trump didn’t quite say he was encouraging Japan to get nuclear weapons, but he did go right up to the line. He was leaving the option on the table. Having seen Trump’s comments to the New York Times, CNN’s Anderson Cooper asked him about it in a CNN town hall in Milwaukee on March 29. Answering Cooper’s question about breaking with Japan’s non-nuclear stance, Trump said, "At some point we have to say, you know what, we're better off if Japan protects itself against this maniac in North Korea." In fact, during the town hall, Cooper gave Trump multiple opportunities to back off his suggestion that Japan may need nuclear weapons, but Trump never did. He said, in succession, "maybe it's going to have to be time to change," "at some point we have to say, you know what, we're better off," "it's going to happen, anyway," and "wouldn't you rather in a certain sense have Japan have nuclear weapons?" That may not fit the strict definition of encouraging Japan to get nuclear weapons, but again, it’s very close. Finally, Trump said something similar on the April 3 edition of Fox News Sunday, when host Chris Wallace pressed Trump on his past comments. After Wallace asked whether Trump wanted to see a nuclear arms race on the Korean peninsula, Trump said, "It's not like, gee whiz, nobody has them. So, North Korea has nukes. Japan has a problem with that. I mean, they have a big problem with that. Maybe they would in fact be better off if they defend themselves from North Korea." Wallace interjected, "With nukes?" Trump responded, "Maybe they would be better off -- including with nukes, yes, including with nukes." How unusual this position is We also asked nuclear policy experts whether Trump’s stated position -- not specifically encouraging Japan to get nuclear weapons, but saying he would be open to it -- was an unusual view, as Clinton suggested. They said it was. "The prevailing, bipartisan and fairly settled academic judgment has been that the risk of loose nukes or accidental nuclear war means that every additional nuclear weapon is a potential cataclysm waiting to happen," said Richard Nephew, a fellow with the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. "I'm not aware of anyone that I'd deem to be a serious policy proponent or thinker who has seriously advocated this in a while." The last major figure Nephew could think of is Kenneth Waltz, an international relations scholar who articulated a "realist" view -- discussed in this 1981 paper -- that said the wide spread of nuclear weapons would create such risks to using them that no country ever would. However, "by the 1960s, most folks had decided that was a horrible idea," Nephew said. "You'd be hard pressed to find anyone saying that since the end of the Cold War." Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, agreed. The statements were so out of the mainstream that "our allies in Japan and the rest of Asia are already alarmed by those statements. Mr. Trump’s suggestion that a nuclear-armed Japan would make the United States or Japan safer is radical and highly dangerous, and is without precedent for a major party presidential nominee." Our ruling Clinton took Trump to task for saying that the United States should "encourage" Japan to get nuclear weapons. Trump used vague and contradictory language, but it’s a fair reading to say his words amounted to encouragement. On more than one occasion, Trump publicly said that Japan, and the United States, might be better off if Japan had nuclear weapons, and he declined multiple attempts by interviewers to backtrack from that view. We rate Clinton’s statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/df21fd77-34c0-411d-8393-27ae8a25fd20	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-06-06T13:49:27	2016-06-02	['United_States', 'Japan']

McDonnell has joined a number of Republicans -- including presidential nominee Mitt Romney -- in criticizing the administration’s announcement in July that states will be allowed to seek waivers from welfare-to-work requirements passed in 1996 under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. Those reforms tied block welfare grants for states to work requirements and limit the amount of time a person can receive benefits. "By unwinding our nation’s welfare-to-work requirements, the Obama administration is making a tragic mistake," McDonnell wrote in an August 6 op-ed that ran in the Richmond Times-Dispatch and is posted on McDonnell’s political website and Romney’s campaign website. Is Obama "unwinding" those requirements? We checked. Tucker Martin, a spokesman for the governor, backed McDonnell’s statement by citing editorials that take aim at the administration’s decision. Martin also emailed us an Associated Press article saying the White House has "quietly opened the door for states to seek major changes in how they meet federal welfare-to-work requirements for some of their poorest residents." The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced the waiver program on July 12, saying exemptions would be granted to allow states to "test alternative and innovative strategies, policies and procedures that are designed to improve employment outcomes for needy families." The directive said "HHS will only consider approving waivers relating to the work participation requirements that make changes intended to lead to more effective means of meeting the work goals of TANF." The department said if a test project does not result in improved employment for welfare recipients, the waiver could be revoked. George Sheldon, an assistant secretary at HHS, said in a July 12 letter to state human services officials that the administration’s move stemmed from a February 28, 2011 presidential memorandum that called on federal agencies to work with state governments to remove regulatory barriers that undermine federal programs. As a result, Sheldon said HHS held talks with state, local and tribal officials about many issues -- including TANF. "During those consultations, many jurisdictions expressed a strong interest in greater flexibility in TANF and indicated that greater flexibility could be used by states to improve program effectiveness," Sheldon said. "We also heard concerns that some TANF rules stifle innovation and focus attention on paperwork rather than helping parents find jobs." The move caused an uproar among conservatives who argued the change was a bid to sneak around welfare-to-work requirements. Romney went a step further in a TV ad that started running last week in Virginia and other swing states, saying, under Obama’s plan, "you wouldn’t have to work and wouldn’t have to train for a job. They just send you your welfare check." Our colleagues at PolitiFact National rated that claim Pants on Fire in an August 7 story. Politifact noted that through the changes, the administration is hoping to make the welfare-to-work efforts more successful -- not end them altogether. FactCheck.org examined that ad’s claim that the adminstration’s decision would "gut welfare reform by dropping work requirements." It concluded, "The plan does neither of those things." It should be noted that the Republican governors of Utah and Nevada have expressed interest in obtaining waivers from TANF requirements in order to boost employment for welfare recipients. "Nevada is very interested in working with your staff to explore program waivers that have the potential to encourage more cooperative relationships among state agencies engaged in economic stimulus through job creation, employment skill attainment and gainful employment activities," Michael Willden, director of Nevada’s Department of Health and Human Services said in an August 2, 2011 letter to HHS. Mary-Sarah Kinner, a spokeswoman for Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, said that although state officials discussed the possibility of a waiver, the state never requested one and doesn’t intend to. But Utah officials have asked for a waiver. "Utah’s goal through all of this is to increase work-related outcomes, and we felt that this waiver would better allow us to achieve that goal," said Nic Dunn, a spokesman for Utah Gov. Gary Herbert. A final note: There’s a dispute about whether the administration is allowed to provide these waivers. Although HHS says it can, Republicans maintain the 1996 law doesn’t allow the executive branch to grant waivers to the work rules. Our Ruling McDonnell said the Obama administration is "unwinding" welfare-to-work requirements. But a new Obama program does not end welfare-to-work mandates. To the contrary, it strengthens the requirements by granting waivers to states seeking to make the work requirements more successful. The waivers would be granted to pilot programs that are individually evaluated; HHS is not proposing a blanket national change to welfare law. We rate McDonnell’s statement False.

pomt-14012	Says she was the first in her family to go to a four-year college.	pants on fire!	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/jun/03/katie-mcginty/rating-katie-mcgintys-curious-campaign-college-cla/	Katie McGinty comes from a working class upbringing, as she routinely tells voters. The senate candidate was the ninth of 10 kids of a restaurant hostess and a police officer. She grew up in Rhawnhurst. She’s hosted numerous campaign events at diners. But what’s drawn the most scrutiny over the last few days are the statements she’s made about college. The third paragraph on the about page of McGinty’s website touts a claim we often hear about candidates from less privileged upbringings: "She was the first in her family to go to a four-year college." Keep an eye on that phrasing. Throughout her campaign, McGinty has returned to this theme. She was quoted by the AP in January saying, "As the ninth of 10 kids and the first in my family to go to college, I’ve been privileged to live the American dream." This week, McGinty’s account tweeted what appeared to be a comment from a college student saying "Katie understands what I’m going through. She was the 1st in her family to go to a 4-year college & didn’t let anything hold her back." Then Buzzfeed revealed late Wednesday that one of McGinty’s older brothers had attended and graduated from LaSalle University nearly a decade before McGinty entered St. Joseph’s. The brother, John Patrick McGinty, Jr., first attended the Community College of Philadelphia and then graduated from La Salle in 1973 with a bachelor of arts degree, according to the 1973 commencement program. A spokesperson for La Salle confirmed to Billy Penn the university was a four-year college, and that to graduate from the university, one would have to attend the university. McGinty graduated from St. Joseph’s in 1985, according to a list of notable alumni from the university, and started there in 1981, according to her LinkedIn page. Through campaign spokesperson Josh Levitt, brother John provided this statement: "The way that Katie and our family have always talked about our experience is she was the first of the 10 McGinty kids to attend and graduate from a four-year college, straight out of high school. We were all really proud of that, just as we were proud that I earned my degree by completing a two-year program and then enrolling in La Salle." Our ruling U.S. Senate candidate Katie McGinty’s campaign website claims she was first person in her family to go to a four-year college. She’s elided this statement further through the course of her campaign. But documentation from La Salle, a four-year institution, shows her brother, John McGinty, graduated from the university in 1973 with a bachelor’s of arts, and the university confirmed to Buzzfeed he started attending the school in 1971. John took a different route to a four-year college by first attending Philadelphia Community College, so McGinty was the first in her family to attend *only* a four-year college directly out of high school. But the language used on McGinty’s website and at other times throughout her campaign doesn’t include this important distinction. We rate McGinty’s claim Pants On Fire.

pomt-02867	One of the "main functions" of the Department of Homeland Security’s SAVE database is "checking voter registration citizenship status."	false	/florida/statements/2013/nov/14/ken-detzner/main-functions-save-database-department-homeland-s/	Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner has been on a public relations mission to defend his plan to use federal Homeland Security data to search for noncitizens on the voting rolls. The key to the revamped process is using a federal resource of data, called the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE. Detzner defended the use of SAVE for voter registration purposes during a Nov. 4 hearing before the Senate committee on ethics and elections. He said using SAVE to check voter registration is one of its primary uses. "In fact, Homeland Security’s ‘benefit categories’ lists checking voter registration citizenship status as one of its main functions. The federal government allows SAVE to be used and check legal status as part of an ensuring the eligibility of registered voters." Detzner said SAVE is used nationwide to verify citizenship for entitlement programs (such as Medicaid), so he argued that the state should be confident that it will provide credible information for elections officials. "SAVE has really been a game-changer when it comes to (voter) list maintenance," he said. We wanted to check this part of Detzner’s claim: Does Homeland Security list checking voter registration citizenship status as one of its main functions? Is voter registration one of the main purposes of SAVE? A document from the Department of Homeland Security lists reasons that government agencies routinely use SAVE to check citizenship status, and the list includes voter registration purposes. Implemented in 1987, SAVE was originally intended to verify eligibility for government benefits, programs and licensing, including Medicaid or welfare, driver’s licenses, government education loans, unemployment compensation, housing assistance or tax exemptions. Over the years, the uses have expanded. SAVE is intended to show if someone is not a citizen, but it does not contain a database of people who are U.S. citizens. That’s why some voting rights groups have argued that SAVE is not a foolproof method to clean up the voter rolls. We wondered what the data said on how often SAVE was used to check voter registration. SAVE includes a query code number for each type of benefit, and agencies are also assigned individual codes. For fiscal year 2013, SAVE had 13,220,774 queries nationwide. The most common query was for driver’s licenses -- that represented about one-third of the queries, or about 4.5 million. Another big category was queries relating to Social Security; those added up to more than 3.5 million. DHS compiled the number of nationwide queries for voter registration and found 13,100 -- so less than 1 percent of the 13 million queries. (In fiscal year 2013 in Florida, there were about one million SAVE queries by Florida agencies, and the majority were for driver’s licenses and health and social services.) We sent Detzner’s spokeswoman a summary of our nationwide findings and asked for any documentation to support that one of the main functions of SAVE is to check voter registration. "The secretary’s comment was about the primary functions of SAVE," said Brittany Lesser in an email. "The document you reference and the DHS quote both verify SAVE’s purposes, which includes checking voter registration. Most of the current uses of SAVE pertain to benefits or licenses. One category pertains to "badging agencies" that need to determine eligibility to access certain facilities. The list also includes "agencies that check citizenship status for voter registration." Voter registration was listed second to last on the list, but DHS spokesman Steven Blando told PolitiFact Florida that the order of uses has no significance. We asked Blando does DHS consider voter registration to be a "main function" of SAVE? "The SAVE database was not designed for this purpose and does not contain information about citizens born in the United States," Blando said. "It is not a main function by volume or number of agencies." Not all states use SAVE to check voter information. In 2005, Maricopa County, Ariz., was the first agency to enter into an agreement with the SAVE Program for voter registration, and a few other counties in Arizona were added later, according to DHS spokesman Christopher Bentley. By 2013, Florida, Colorado, Iowa and North Carolina had reached similar agreements. States with pending applications to use SAVE for voter lists include Georgia, Kansas, Michigan, Mississippi, Oregon, Tennessee and Virginia. Our ruling Detzner told state legislators that one of the "main functions" of the Department of Homeland Security’s SAVE database is "checking voter registration citizenship status." A federal document lists voter registration as one of the benefits that SAVE data can be used for to check citizenship status. However, we found no documentation to support Detzner’s claim that voter registration is one of its "main functions." SAVE is primarily used for agencies to check citizenship status for public benefits or driver’s licenses. Using SAVE to check voter registration eligibility is a more recent use, and only in effect in four states, plus a few Arizona counties. For fiscal year 2013, voter registration queries equaled less than 1 percent of the searches. We rate this claim False.	None	Ken Detzner	None	None	None	2013-11-14T10:00:00	2013-11-04	['None']
pomt-09593	The House health care bill provides for "free abortion services, and probably forced participation in abortions by members of the medical profession."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/21/chain-email/chain-e-mail-claims-house-health-care-bill-would-p/	A chain e-mail written by former attorney Michael Connelly -- which blasts the Democrats' health care plan as unconstitutional -- was penned in August, but continues to make the rounds. Although many of the issues in the e-mail have been addressed in previous PolitiFact items, we continue to get queries about it. So we've decided to visit -- or revisit -- several claims made in the e-mail. In this item, we will address the claim that HR 3200, "The Affordable Health Care Choices Act of 2009," would provide for "free abortion services, and probably forced participation in abortions by members of the medical profession." In the health care debate, abortion coverage has been a moving target as provisions have changed in various versions of the House and Senate bills. And we should note that Connelly wrote his e-mail back in August, long before the bills came to the floors of the two chambers. The House ultimately passed a health care bill that included an abortion amendment that essentially renders Connelly's argument moot. Still, Connelly said in an interview with PolitiFact on Jan. 20, 2010, that the same concerns he raised about the House bill back in August apply to the version of the health care bill passed by the Senate. Before we address that, let's back up a step. Although the original health care reform bills introduced in both the House and Senate were silent on abortion, the issue came to a head in late July when the House Energy and Commerce Committee passed an amendment offered by Rep. Lois Capps, D-Calif., which sought to make abortion coverage available in both the public plan and in private plans participating in the exchange, but paid exclusively through patient premiums, not government subsidies. Under that amendment, insurers would not be required to offer, or be prohibited from offering, abortion services in order to participate in the exchange. It also provided "conscience protections" so that any insurance plan participating in the exchange could not discriminate against hospitals or other health care facilities (such as Catholic hospitals) unwilling to provide abortions. That was largely the working House plan when Connelly penned his e-mail. And by that measure, we think Connelly was wrong when he said the bill would provide free abortions. Insurance purchased through private insurers on the exchange or the public option would not be "free." In fact, the amendment required that abortion coverage be paid through premiums paid by the insured. And Connelly's claim that the bill would probably mean "forced participation in abortions by members of the medical profession," was specifically prohibited in "conscience protection" measures in the amendment. And that all became moot in November 2009, when a group of Democrats led by Rep. Bart Stupak of Michigan forced a vote on an amendment that included tight restrictions barring any insurance plan that is purchased with government subsidies from covering abortions. It passed. Connelly said the concerns he raised in his August e-mail no longer apply to the House bill. But they still apply to the bill that passed the Senate, he said. The abortion language in the Senate bill is close to that in the Capps Amendment (though the Senate plan does not include a public option). As with the earlier House bill, the Senate plan would allow insurance companies on the exchange to offer abortion services. But for the same reasons we mentioned about the earlier House plan, we think it's a distortion to say it would provide "free abortions." And as in the earlier House bill, there are specific "conscience protections" written into the bill that make it clear doctors could not be discriminated against for opting not to provide abortions. So under the bill, no doctors would be forced to provide abortions. In other words, the claim was false when Connelly made it; it's moot now with regard to the House bill; and it's false with regard to the Senate bill. In other words, under no version of the plan then or now is Connelly's statement accurate. And we rate the claim False.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2010-01-21T17:37:57	2009-08-28	['None']
pomt-09409	The Democratic health care plan is a "government takeover of nearly 20 percent of our economy."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2010/mar/19/republican-party-florida/florida-republican-party-claims-democratic-health-/	If you've been following the health care debate, you've surely heard this line from Republicans: The Democratic plan is a "government takeover" of the nation's health care system. That's a potent talking point for the GOP because it conjures images of a sluggish, state-run bureaucracy. The Republican Party of Florida used it in a March 19, 2010, news release intended to pressure Democratic U.S. Rep. Allen Boyd, who represents a conservative district in north Florida, to vote against the bill. (It didn't work. He announced a few hours later he was supporting the bill.) The release said: "This morning while Congressman Allen Boyd is deciding whether or not he’ll support the trillion dollar Obama-Pelosi-Reid government-run health care experiment, and since the voicemail boxes at his offices are full, the Republican Party of Florida decided to remind the Congressman of what some of his constituents had to say about the government takeover of nearly 20 percent of our economy." The release had links to YouTube videos of people speaking against the plan at Boyd's town hall meetings. The RPOF's wording is slightly different than the most recent version we checked, when U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young made the claim in a speech to Pinellas County Republicans. But it's still just as wrong. Before we delve into the big reasons why it's wrong, we should note that the sentence has a tiny element of truth -- that health care accounts for nearly 20 percent of the economy. Indeed, the latest estimate by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services says that health care accounted for 17.3 percent of the economy last year and is expected to grow to 19.3 percent by 2019. But that's a thin gruel of accuracy in a false claim that has been repeated many times, despite being discredited by PolitiFact, FactCheck.org and other news organizations. By any reasonable definition, there's no way the Democratic plan could be considered a government takeover. Indeed, the plan's primary approach is to set up new systems to encourage private health insurance companies to compete to provide more coverage and better services. The cornerstone of the Democratic program is actually the status quo. The majority of Americans would continue to get health coverage the way they do now -- from private insurance companies. That coverage would be paid for the same way it is now -- by private employers and individual premiums. That's not a government takeover. The biggest change in the Democratic plan is the creation of health care exchanges that are supposed to provide coverage for Americans who have trouble getting it now -- people who are self-employed or work for small companies. The exchanges -- one in each state -- would be virtual marketplaces where people could shop for the best coverage. Although a government-run "public option" was included in the version of the bill that first passed the House, it is not in the current bill under consideration. The one significant element of the plan that would increase government's role in providing coverage is the expansion of Medicaid. Under the latest version, Medicaid would be expanded to cover anyone below 133 percent of poverty level. That's estimated to add about 18 million people to Medicaid rolls. Still, that's far short of a "government takeover," a phrase that suggests a complete government-run health care system. So once again, we are faced with over-the-top rhetoric about the health care plan. It's perfectly legitimate to raise questions about the plan and the government's role, but it's wildly incorrect to label it a government takeover. Yes, the plan would expand the government's role, but it primarily would continue to rely on private insurers for the vast majority of Americans. And, for people who have trouble getting coverage, it would create a marketplace so people could shop for coverage from private insurers. It's ridiculously false to call that a government takeover. Once again, we need to strike a match and set the meter ablaze. Pants on Fire!	None	Republican Party of Florida	None	None	None	2010-03-19T15:26:51	2010-03-19	['Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-03668	"In barely four years in office, five jihadists have reached their targets in the United States under Barack Obama," compared to zero "in over seven years after 9/11 under George W. Bush."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/26/tom-cotton/rep-tom-cotton-says-more-terrorists-have-reached-t/	During a House floor speech just days after the Boston Marathon bombing, Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., sought to compare President Barack Obama’s record on terrorism unfavorably to that of Obama’s predecessor in the White House, George W. Bush. "I rise today to express grave doubts about the Obama administration’s counterterrorism policies and programs. ..." Cotton said. "In barely four years in office, five jihadists have reached their targets in the United States under Barack Obama: the Boston Marathon Bomber, the Underwear Bomber, the Times Square Bomber, the Fort Hood shooter, and, in my own state, the Little Rock recruiting office shooter. In over seven years after 9/11, under George W. Bush, how many terrorists reached their targets in the United States? Zero. We need to ask: Why is the Obama administration failing in its mission to stop terrorism before it reaches its targets in the United States?" In the Boston attack, Dzokhar Tsarnaev has been charged with carrying out the bombing with his brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was killed while being chased by police. As for the other terrorist plots Cotton referenced, here are brief summaries: Umar Farook Abdulmutallab became known as the "underwear bomber" on Dec. 25, 2009, after he tried to blow up a plane flying to Detroit using a bomb strapped to his underwear. He was convicted and is serving life in prison. Faisal Shahzad tried to plant a bomb in New York City’s Times Square on May 1, 2010. Bystanders discovered the bomb and the police were able to keep it from going off. Shahzad pleaded guilty and is serving life in prison. Nidal Hasan, a psychiatrist and major in the U.S. Army Medical Corps, is the only suspect in a shooting rampage at Fort Hood, Texas, that left 13 soldiers and civilians dead and more than two dozen others wounded on Nov. 5, 2009. Hasan is awaiting a military trial that could bring the death penalty. Prior to the shootings, the government intercepted at least 18 emails between Hasan and Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born cleric tied to al-Qaida. Abdulhakim Muhammed, a convert to Islam who was born Carlos Bledsoe, pleaded guilty to killing Pvt. William Long and wounding Pvt. Quinton Ezeagwula during a shooting outside a U.S. Army recruiting station in Little Rock, Ark., in 2009. He is now serving life in prison. However, Cotton’s comparison requires some creative accounting. Here are some of the problems with Cotton’s claim: • He ignores at least two post-9/11 examples of jihad-inspired terrorism under Bush that resulted in casualties. One is the July 4, 2002, incident in which Hesham Mohamed Hadayet, an Egyptian immigrant, fired on an El Al ticket counter at Los Angeles International Airport, killing two. The other is the March 2006 case of Mohammed Reza Taheri-azar, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill graduate, driving an SUV onto campus, striking nine pedestrians, resulting in injuries but no fatalities. Both cases were reportedly motivated by radical Islam. • He uses inconsistent definitions of "reached their targets." "Reached their targets" can mean either "reach the point of carrying out an attack" or "actually carrying out an attack." If it’s "reach the point of carrying out an attack," then Cotton is ignoring not just the two Bush-era examples above, but also the Dec. 22, 2001, "shoe-bombing" incident, in which Richard Reid was foiled trying to detonate plastic explosives packed in his shoes. It would be inconsistent for Cotton to exclude the shoe-bomber (who tried to strike during Bush’s tenure) when he includes the "underwear bomber" (whose plot came under Obama) when both were stopped before exploding their devices. If the standard is to "reach the point of carrying out an attack," then we count three post 9/11 terrorist plots by Islamic radicals under Bush and five under Obama -- a difference, but not one as stark as Cotton’s calculation. If the standard is "actually carrying out an attack," then the count would be two under Bush and three under Obama, which is even less of a difference. • Blaming the president for terrorist attacks on their watch has limited value. For starters, the nuts and bolts of preventing terrorist attacks is handled by career government officials in such agencies as the CIA and the FBI -- officials who are likely carrying out their duties regardless of who the president is. In addition, Cotton’s formulation doesn’t take into account plots in which arrests were made before aspiring terrorists have "reached their targets." When we raised some of these issues with Cotton’s office, a spokeswoman provided a rebuttal from the congressman. "Neither the Los Angeles airport shooter nor the UNC driver had a documented history of association with terrorist groups, as did the five attackers in the Obama years," the statement from Cotton said. "As for the shoe bomber, he was a foreigner screened by a foreign agency (French) without significant American assistance and with a foreign target (international waters). By contrast, the underwear bomber was screened with American input and reached his target over a major American city (Detroit)." Cotton’s statement continued, "These three persons you cited from the Bush years hadn't been on a government list or subject to investigation, while all five attackers in the Obama years were. Finally, reaching the target means reaching the point of intended attack, not necessarily executing the attack. Counting on terrorist incompetence isn’t a sound counterterrorism strategy." We should note that Cotton’s comments on the House floor didn’t include these kinds of qualifiers, but we decided to explore the merits of their argument anyway. We asked Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism expert who is a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, what he thought of Cotton’s arguments. He said they have at least partial merit. As we have noted in a previous item, there are several cases under Obama in which future perpetrators of terrorists acts had already gotten themselves onto the U.S. government’s radar screen, including Muhammed, Hasan and Abdulmutallab, as opposed to none during the Bush years. Gartenstein-Ross says it’s reasonable to have greater concern about cases in which the government had looked into an individual but did not end up preventing an attack. A possible counter-argument is that the lack of a "documented history of association with terrorist groups" that Cotton cites could instead be considered a reflection of poor intelligence work. Advance suspicion that an individual might be a terrorist could be a point of distinction between the shoe bomber and the underwear bomber, he added, since the underwear bomber’s father sent the U.S. an urgent warning and nothing equivalent happened with the shoe bomber. On the other hand, we doubt the shoe bomber, as Cotton suggests, intended to attack international waters; his target, like the underwear bomber’s, was a U.S.-based airline filled with passengers, many of them Americans. Ultimately, Gartenstein-Ross said, it is an "appropriate question to ask" whether the Obama administration has "in some way put into place policies that hamper investigations or aggressive action." Still, he said, the congressman’s statement was, "like a lot of rhetoric, overheated." Our ruling Cotton said, "In barely four years in office, five jihadists have reached their targets in the United States under Barack Obama," compared to zero "in over seven years after 9/11 under George W. Bush." Cotton’s math is inconsistent and stacked against Obama -- and there’s a limit to how fairly a comparison like this reflects what an administration can accomplish in counter-terrorism. On balance, we rate Cotton’s claim Mostly False.	None	Tom Cotton	None	None	None	2013-04-26T17:59:45	2013-04-24	['United_States', 'George_W._Bush', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-07265	"The (health reform) legislation which Washington passed last year has made it more difficult to hire" because it’s increased costs for employers.	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/may/26/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-says-health-care-reform-has-hamper/	Congress passed a health care bill last year with twin goals of insuring more Americans while putting the brakes on runaway medical spending. We’ll see if those goals are achieved sometime after 2014 when the main provisions take effect. Until then, all we have are projections. Sen. Rob Portman, however, focused recently on the here and now. Even before the big provisions kick in that will expand health coverage to nearly all Americans, Portman says he is hearing from employers that their premiums are rising because of the law, called the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. And those rising costs are making it harder for them to hire new employees, he says. "The legislation which Washington passed last year has made it more difficult to hire because it’s increased the cost of hiring someone," Portman told reporters on May 3, when he unveiled a "Jobs Plan" that included a proposed rollback of the health law. A few days later, Portman said small businesses have told him health care reform is already driving up their costs. "People are telling me 15- and 16-percent premium increases," he said. Some provisions of the health care law did take effect last fall and early this year. Employers now must enroll employees’ dependent children, if the parents wish to add them, until they are 26 years old. New policies must pay for preventive care without tapping the employee’s deductible. And health plans cannot cap the lifetime value of medical care they will cover. Each of these might seem like it would make insurance premiums jump. "It’s a basic principle of economics: If you add more things, it will cost more," said Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for America’s Health Insurance Plans, the health insurance lobby. Yet conservative business groups and liberal advocates alike say that generally, those increases have been small. Adding a 24-year-old to your health coverage might require you to get a family plan if you only have individual or spousal coverage, so your employer would have a higher cost if it pays for part of your insurance. But young adults typically don’t use a lot of medical services and have very low health care costs. Similarly, full coverage of preventive care is only required for new policies. As for the lifting of lifetime limits on what a plan will pay, Bill Robertson, president of the Concord Benefit Planning Agency, a benefits consultant from Lake County, near Cleveland, told us that rarely happens now since the caps tend to be a $1 million or more. "I’ve been in business 36 years," he said. "I have cumulatively insured 50,000 people. I have seen one claim go above the cap." Altogether, these new requirements added an average of 2.5 percent this year to the cost of employer-provided health insurance, according to modeling by the Lockton Benefits Group, a division of Lockton Cos., a large, privately held insurance brokerage. A study last fall by Mercer, an international consulting firm, put the average cost increase attributable to the immediate changes at 2.3 percent, with small companies (under 500 workers) averaging 3 percent and large companies (5,000 or more workers) 1.9 percent. Finally, the Ohio Department of Insurance, which regulates insurers and must approve many rate hikes, says premiums have risen about 15 percent, but only 2 to 3 percent is due to requirements of the Affordable Care Act. We asked Portman to elaborate on his claim. He mentioned a Congressional Budget Office study that, he said, predicted 800,000 fewer people in jobs as a result of the health care legislation. That’s after 2014, however, and the study did not actually state this number of jobs. Instead, congressional Republicans extrapolated the number -- variously cited as 650,000 or 800,000 -- during a hearing in which the CBO director was testifying. Separate analyses by PolitFact,FactCheck.org, and The Washington Post all found problems with the GOP’s interpretation. The CBO never said these jobs would be lost due to higher cost for employers. Rather, the CBO discussed a small reduction in the amount of labor in the economy, some of which would be caused by people leaving the workforce because they will no longer need to hold onto a job just to maintain their health insurance. PolitiFact ruled that a claim nearly identical to Portman’s, based on the CBO report, was False. Portman, however, told us that he based his claim on more than the CBO study. As he has said several times recently, this is what Ohio business owners are telling him. He provided us with names. Fredon Corp., a family-owned precision machining company in Mentor, has 78 employees and avoided layoffs during the economic downturn, said Alyson Scott, the chief financial officer. Now it plans to start hiring. Rising health insurance costs do make hiring a bigger challenge, she said. "It absolutely goes to your overall expenses," she said. The company used to face annual premium hikes of about 10 percent -- increases the insurance industry attributed to inflation, an aging population and high use of medical services by all Americans. But Fredon was quoted a 22.6 percent hike for this year for the same Medical Mutual of Ohio coverage that it had in 2010. "They said they have no idea what’s going to happen in the future and they have to cover their costs," Scott said. Fredon’s insurance broker, Lisa Dimberio Nelson of Right Track Benefits, negotiated the increase down to 15 percent, said Scott, whose account was confirmed by Nelson. "What the carriers are telling us," Nelson said, "is that it’s the mandates." They say "it’s not our fault, it’s the mandates," she said. Yet Fredon plans to expand its workforce anyway. So did higher premiums really have an effect? Absolutely, said Scott. It won’t prevent hiring, but it has caused the company to reassess "how much we’re hiring, and at what stage." We contacted Medical Mutual and asked about rate hikes necessary to cover the mandates of the Affordable Care Act. "At this point, health care reform has had a minimal impact on pricing and it is too early to determine the future impact as the major provisions of the legislation do not take effect for nearly three more years," said Ed Byers, Medical Mutual’s spokesman. He was at a loss to explain why Fredon and its broker had the clear impression that a big part of its increase was due to health reform mandates. Portman’s office recommended other companies to us, too. Three of them agreed to interviews: PR Machine Works in Mansfield, Mound Laser in Miamisburg, and Rebsco Inc. in Greenville. Zoi Romanchuk, vice president of PR Machine Works, said premiums rose just 3 percent this year at her 55-employee company, but she expects a big increase next year. The company saw a 30 percent increase in 2009, which predates health reform. She said that other companies tell her they got hit with 30 percent and 40 percent hikes this year. Has this effected hiring at her company? "Not yet," she said. Mound Laser President and CEO Larry Dosser said premiums rose 20 percent this year, after experiencing premium increases in the low single digits for his 30-employee company. The company used to pay 100 percent of its workers’ policy costs but dropped its share to 90 percent, Dosser said. Ninety percent of Mound Laser’s work involves making microscopic parts for manufacturers in the medical device industry, which will face a special tax starting in 2013 to help offset health reform’s costs. The White House says the tax won’t hurt because the medical device industry will prosper from new patients gaining health insurance, but Dosser fears it could force his customers to move overseas, impacting his business. So is Mound Laser slowing its hiring? Not at all, Dosser said. It plans to grow to about 50 employees by the end of the year, "because I refuse to be dictated to by those kinds of policies." Then there’s Rebsco, a metal fabrication design and manufacturing company. It faced a 23 percent premium hike for insurance on its 20 employees, but held it down to 10 percent to 12 percent by raising the deductible. That means that workers, too, got hit with higher out-of-pocket costs, according to Tyeis Baker-Baumann, the company’s president. Has it affected hiring? It has in the sense that every new expense hurts, Baumann said. Her company could use two or three more workers, but "we’re not going to (hire) at this point," she said. "We’ll put that discussion off for as long as possible." Why are employers under the impression that health care reform is to blame for double-figure rate hikes? Gary Claxton, vice president of the nonprofit, nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation and an authority on the insurance marketplace, offered this theory: "If you were an insurer and you wanted to blame someone else, wouldn’t you blame the government?" So how do we assess Portman’s statement? We have the CBO report, which would point toward a rating of False. We have assessments from the insurance industry and regulators, which put the premium increases attributable to the new law around 2.5 percent. And we have the companies Portman cited. Fredon Corp. says it has not cut hiring, but is reassessing how much. Its insurer insists health care reform has had a minimal impact on pricing. PR Machine Works is still hiring. Mound Laser is not slowing its hiring because that would be a capitulation. And Rebsco will delay new hiring because every new cost hurts -- including insurance. After looking at considerable amounts of data and studies, talking with industry and association experts and phoning people who run small companies, we found that Portman’s statement had some elements of truth. But there were too many critical facts pointing the other direction, too many misleading or confused assumptions about the cause of double-digit premium hikes -- and too few actual lost jobs or slowdowns attributable to health reform -- for the Truth-O-Meter to point in any other direction than Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09464	Cover Florida "is available to any Floridian, offering basic coverage for about $150 a month, instead of the typical $600 a month."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/mar/03/charlie-crist/crist-says-cover-florida-offers-basic-health-cover/	In his State of the State address, Gov. Charlie Crist cited a litany of accomplishments. Among them: Cover Florida, a state-backed health insurance plan designed to make coverage available to uninsured residents. "This program is available to almost any Floridian, offering basic coverage for about $150 a month, instead of the typical $600 a month," he said. "As with any private sector plan, the more extensive coverage you want, the higher the premiums, but with so many lacking basic preventive care, Cover Florida remains a sound option for thousands of Floridians." When we checked a similar claim from Crist in October, Crist said it usually costs $900 to get health insurance. That earned a False ruling because he was comparing apples and oranges. His claim is different this time, and so is the produce-aisle metaphor we're using to describe his technique: He's cherry-picking. First, some background. Launched in 2008, Cover Florida allows people without coverage for at least six months to pick from plans offered by six insurance companies. The state selected each provider through a competitive bidding process. The provider offers at least two options — one with catastrophic and hospital coverage, and another plan that can provide less coverage. The program's Web site says that the statewide individual plans can be purchased for as little as $23 a month, to as much as $500 a month, depending on age, gender and level of coverage. Patients pick and choose between various options offered through the insurers. So, for example, a woman who is between 19 and 29 years of age can pay $130 a month for a plan that includes no deductible, $10 copays for doctor visits, but no hospital inpatient coverage. Critics contend Cover Florida Health Care hasn't done enough to cover the uninsured. As of Dec. 31, 2009, about 5,400 people have enrolled — about 0.1 percent of the state's uninsured population, which Crist put at 3.8 million in his speech. But in his speech, Crist avoided those numbers and focused instead on the price. Let's examine both numbers he used. First, Crist avoided the apples and oranges mistake he made last time, in which he compared a number for family coverage with a number for individuals. But he stretched the truth in other ways. He said basic coverage is available for about $150 a month. But we find that he's chosen a low number from the wide menu of options to give himself a favorable comparison. When people think about health insurance they probably think of coverage that includes hospitalization. And the two statewide Cover Florida plans that offer that coverage are Blue Cross Blue Shield -- average cost $148 for a single -- and United Healthcare, which averages $327. It's also worth noting that is for very basic coverage that includes higher deductibles than you might typically get for a traditional health plan from your employer. The other part of Crist's claim is that the typical price for coverage for an individual is $600 a month. But we checked that against numbers from the Kaiser Family Foundation, which Crist's office had cited when we checked his earlier claim, and found he's way off. A 2009 Kaiser study says the average monthly cost for a single plan from an employer is $402. (On average, Kaiser found that employers pay 83 percent of an individual's cost, leaving workers to pay about $68). A study by eHealth, which offers coverage to people on the individual market when they cannot get employer coverage, said the average monthly cost is $161. That number is lower than the employer-provided cost because the policies typically have higher deductibles or fewer benefits. Also, insurers in the individual market can deny coverage for pre-existing conditions. So Crist's overall point has some truth to it -- you can get basic coverage for $150. But he's doing some artful cherry-picking. He chose the lowest average rate for Cover Florida ($150, when the other plan costs $327) and a very high number for the private market ($600, when studies show it would cost more in the range of $160-$400.) That's such a significant difference that we find his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2010-03-03T18:29:44	2010-03-02	['Florida']
pomt-05577	The Florida Department of Agriculture’s website FreshFromFlorida.com can be used "to get a permit to carry a loaded hidden gun without ever leaving your house."	false	/florida/statements/2012/apr/03/brady-campaign-prevent-gun-violence/can-you-get-gun-florida-without-ever-leaving-your-/	Obtaining a permit to carry a concealed gun in Florida is so easy that Floridians can do it without leaving the comfort of their own homes, according to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. Dan Gross, the president of the group, testified about Florida’s gun laws at a briefing held with some congressional Democrats March 27. The topic was racial profiling and "stand your ground" laws in the wake of the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin. Martin, an unarmed black teenager from Miami Gardens, was shot and killed by a white neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla. The volunteer, George Zimmerman, has not been arrested, and that has spurred debate of Florida’s "stand your ground" gun law. The Brady Campaign says Florida has become a "great success story" for the gun lobby. "In Florida, being armed in public is such a casual formality that law enforcement does not issue the license to carry loaded, concealed guns; that is done by the Department of Agriculture – the same agency charged with issuing permits to pick tomatoes or transport livestock," Gross said. "Their website is FreshFromFlorida.com. You can use it to get a permit to carry a loaded hidden gun without ever leaving your house," he added. Gross made it sound incredibly easy to obtain a concealed weapons permit. Can Floridians simply log on to FreshFromFlorida.com and obtain a weapons permit without getting off the couch? We decided to investigate. Requirements for a concealed weapons permit in Florida The Brady Campaign is right that it is the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services that issues concealed weapons permits. It was easy to download the two-page application and about 45 pages containing the application instructions and the law. But the process is much more complicated than just filling out an online form. Candidates must provide a photograph, pay a fee and have their application form notarized. Most significantly for purposes of this fact-check, applicants must show proof of having gone through a firearms training class, and they must be fingerprinted. (Out-of-state applicants don’t have to come to Florida but must follow the same guidelines, including getting fingerprinted by law enforcement.) We thought those two requirements showed the Brady Campaign was wrong in its statement. The Brady Campaign, though, responded to our questions and argued that even these two criteria could be done from home. So let’s review the evidence. • Firearms training documentation: Florida law states in 790.06(2)(h) that an instructor "must maintain records certifying that he or she observed the student safely handle and discharge the firearm." That can be a class taught by law enforcement, the National Rifle Association, or any other class approved by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. So that rules out an online course, said Sterling Ivey, spokeman for the agriculture department. But the Brady Campaign responded that some certified instructors will come to your home, pointing us to groups like Florida Concealed Weapons Carry. Its website states: "We will come to your location and provide a shooting trailer anywhere within an hour and a half radius from Starke, Fla. We provide all materials, concealed weapons pictures, and notary on the spot." We spoke to the owner of that company, Eric Wall. "When I go to their house we usually have it in their living room or whatever to go over the details of concealed carry," he said. Then the applicants head to his trailer, which is a mobile shooting range. "I have to physically watch everyone handle, load and shoot a firearm." Worried the neighbors might complain about your participation in a mobile firearm class in your driveway? The trailer is soundproof, said Wall. He’s even done training at dentists’ and doctors' offices, he said. (We should note that going into the trailer means you need to leave your house, even though you're still on your own property.) Wall said he can take care of the firearms class, photo and notary all at an applicant's home. Typically, Wall trains small groups and charges $50 per person, but it depends on the distance he has to travel. We also spoke to Irving Gelbart, a retired Miami-Dade police lieutenant who teaches mobile classes through his company, Pentagon Defense Products and Training Alliance. Gelbart said he will do the class work in someone’s home but prefers a range for the shooting portion. The Brady Campaign also noted that applicants can use past shooting experience, pointing to language on the application that says acceptable documentation includes "evidence of experience with a firearm obtained through participation in organized shooting competition." Ivey said a mobile firearm class is allowed, as long as it meets the requirements of having the instructor observe the student safely handle the firearm. He also said that past shooting experience is acceptable, but that would likely have meant the person left their home. • A set of fingerprints or a copy of a receipt showing that they had a scan of their fingerprints: Florida’s application states that "fingerprints must be taken at a LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY’’ and the statute requires "a full set of fingerprints of the applicant administered by a law enforcement agency. We thought this element definitely contradicted the Brady Campaign’s statement, but spokeswoman Caroline Brewer said not so fast. "Our statement was discussing the application form that is downloadable from the Florida website, which the context makes clear," she said via email. "However, even if you read our statement as applying to the separate fingerprint card sent by mail and not downloadable, yes, there are many fingerprinting services that say they will come to your home to take your fingerprints, some of which even say that they are done under the authority of law enforcement and valid for Florida." The Brady Campaign pointed us to several mobile fingerprinting services. These services do exist, but we could not find a mobile company that would provide this service at Floridians’ homes. We spoke to owners at three mobile fingerprint companies in Florida -- 1 SureScan in Orlando, Anytime Mobile Fingerprinting in the Tampa area and Fingerprint Technologies in Coral Gables -- who told us that they had inquired with FDLE about providing that service and had been discouraged or told it wasn’t allowed. We asked FDLE if they would accept fingerprints from a mobile company for the concealed weapons permit. FDLE spokesman Keith Kameg replied: "It is our understanding that FL Statute 790.06 (4)(c) states that fingerprinting is to be administered by a law enforcement agency. FDLE performs the background checks and provides the results to Department of Agriculture." Possible -- but common? Clearly, many applicants handle at least part of the application process from home: Since July 2011, about 45,000 used the agriculture department’s regional offices while 89,000 mailed them in from elsewhere. And it is possible to download the permit from FreshFromFlorida.com, hire a mobile firearm instructor/notary/photographer, and mail in the application from home. There is no way to know how many applicants -- if any -- have done that. Several experts on Florida’s permitting process said either that they had never heard of mobile firearms training or that it was a rarity. The part of the Brady Campaign's claim that seems to fall short is about fingerprints: We could not find any indication that applicants in Florida could summon mobile fingerprinters to their homes. Our ruling Dan Gross, the president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said that at the Florida Department of Agriculture’s website FreshFromFlorida.com, people can "get a permit to carry a loaded hidden gun without ever leaving your house." The Brady Campaign argued that their claim referred to the application itself. But fingerprints are required as part of the application process, and Gross made no such distinction in his statement. We think his overall message was clear: He was trying to convey that it’s so easy to get a gun permit that you can do it from home. The law, though, requires that people receive firearms training and be fingerprinted by law enforcement, two elements that would typically require people to leave their homes. While it’s possible to pay a firearms trainer to come to your property, we found no evidence that such training is widespread. We also found no evidence that mobile fingerprinting would be allowed for the gun permit application in the state of Florida. We rate this claim False.

pomt-02725	Gov. Scott Walker bought "80 new, brand-new vehicles" for the state that "we probably don’t need."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/dec/20/kathleen-vinehout/casting-scott-walker-spender-democrat-says-walker-/	Criss-crossing Wisconsin to scope out a possible campaign for governor, state Sen. Kathleen Vinehout depicts Gov. Scott Walker as a spender and borrower, saying she would not have grown the state budget the way he has in his first term. In terms of spending, the Alma Democrat said at a suburban Milwaukee home on Dec. 5, 2013 she would "get rid of some things that we probably don't really need," according to a video of part of the meeting. "Like, I like to pick on the 80 new, brand-new vehicles that the governor bought," she told the group. "We probably don't need 80 new, brand-new vehicles. So, get rid of that." By emphasizing "brand new," Vinehout suggests the vehicle purchases are unnecessary or excessive. So let’s peek into the garage. The backdrop Vinehout made her claim in tandem with two statements critical of Walker’s budgeting. In saying the governor’s 2013-’15 budget "spends $4 billion more" than his 2011-’13 budget, Vinehout made a claim similar to one made by Democrat Mary Burke, the only announced candidate for governor in 2014. We rated Burke’s statement, that the state budget had grown $4.6 billion under Walker, as Half True. The figure was accurate, but the increase is due almost completely to Medicaid costs, not budget decisions Walker made. Vinehout also said Walker’s two budgets led to a record percentage of state tax money being spent on debt payments. That also earned a Half True. The 5.26 percent of general fund revenue is the highest on record, but it reached that level because of the borrowing and debt restructuring done by previous governors, as well as by Walker. The vehicles Vinehout is recovering from surgery for a fractured arm she suffered in a car accident on Dec. 8, 2013 and was unavailable to comment. Her chief of staff, Linda Kleinschmidt, cited an appropriation in Walker's 2013-’15 budget, but said she did not know why Vinehout singled it out for criticism. The appropriation is for $1.14 million in 2013-’14, an increase of 15 percent over the previous year, and the same amount in 2014-’15, for a total of $2.28 million. The vehicles would be for Central Fleet, which is overseen by Walker's Department of Administration and manages about 1,500 of the state’s vehicles. The budget authorizes purchasing a total of 80 vehicles, but more specifically calls for adding 38 vehicles in 2013-’14 and 38 more the next year, for a total of 76. As of mid-December 2013 no vehicles had yet been purchased but planning is underway, according to Stephanie Marquis, spokeswoman for the Department of Administration. So, Walker’s budget authorizes the purchase of 80 vehicles, but to this point, he hasn’t bought any. The rationale Walker spokesman Tom Evenson said the purchases are aimed at saving money. He cited another budget document from the fiscal bureau. That memo says the Walker administration believes owning more vehicles will mean spending less on leasing vehicles and less on reimbursing state employees for work use of their personal cars. For example, the administration says the state-owned vehicles cost an average of 35 cents per mile to operate, while the per-mile state reimbursement rate to employees is 51 cents. All told, the Walker administration estimates the state will save $563,700 over the two-year budget if 76 vehicles are purchased. So, the purchases aren’t simply adding spending but rather are aimed at saving money in the long run. Our rating Vinehout said Walker bought "80 new, brand-new vehicles" for the state that "we probably don’t need." Walker did add money to the state budget to buy roughly 80 more vehicles. But he hasn’t bought any yet and, despite Vinehout’s characterization of the purchases being an unnecessary expense, they are aimed at saving money. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression -- our definition of Mostly False.

pomt-09028	"As Washington debates cracking down on the big Wall Street banks, I’ve passed legislation that does so."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/jul/07/david-segal/segal-says-he-passed-laws-cracking-down-wall-stree/	Like many candidates in this midterm election, state Rep. David Segal, one of four Democrats running for Congress in the 1st District, has pledged to fight for families and stand up to corporate interests. On his website, he takes that promise a step further: "Together, we’ve won some important victories. As Washington debates cracking down on the big Wall Street banks, I’ve passed legislation that does so. Working hand-in-hand with the grassroots, I pushed into law bills that crack down on the big banks’ foreclosures and predatory lending." What big Wall Street banks was he muscling in Rhode Island? We decided to ask him. Segal says the statement refers to two pieces of legislation he helped pass. The first was a 2006 ordinance targeting predatory lending that he sponsored while serving as a member of the Providence City Council. The bill forbids Providence to deposit city funds with so-called predatory lenders. The ordinance did little to stop the foreclosure storm headed for Rhode Island. But it’s true that Segal and the council took steps to address the problem more than two years before it reached crisis stage. The second piece of legislation Segal cited is a 2009 bill he sponsored as a state representative. The version that ultimately passed requires lenders to notify borrowers at least 45 days before a foreclosure action. The written notice must advise the borrower of the availability of free counseling through mortgage counselors approved by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Segal says his sponsorship of the bill constitutes "cracking down" on the "big Wall Street banks" because lobbyists associated with those banks testified against the proposal in committee hearings. This is where his claim proves to be too bold. Records show that only one person representing large banks testified in opposition at the first hearing on March 31: James Hahn, a Providence lawyer who spoke on behalf of the Rhode Island Mortgage Bankers Association. The House Judiciary Committee did not tape that hearing, leaving no official record. But Hahn said his association -- which lobbies for both very large national banks and very small local ones -- offered lukewarm opposition. Segal contended that the second hearing, on October 27, was much more heated. The bank lobbyists, he said, strenuously objected to the bill and he angrily stood up to them. That proceeding was recorded. Watch the tape, Segal urged us, you’ll see. So we did. But we saw no one strenuously objecting to anything. In fact, it seemed quite civil. Three banking industry lobbyists testified. All expressed support for Segal’s legislation. Among them, Bill Farrell, the lobbyist for the Rhode Island Bankers Association, testified that he had "no problem with the language that’s in this proposal." Their only objection was that a second compromise provision they’d worked on with Segal and several housing advocates had been pulled at the last second without their knowledge. That measure would have preempted cities and towns from establishing individual municipal foreclosure statutes, something the lobbyists thought would create confusion. Despite what he told us about getting angry that day, Segal himself says little on the tape to oppose their testimony, or to address the preemption issue. But he now says he was responsible for having the municipal provision removed and cites that as proof that he cracked down on "big Wall Street banks." Segal argues that the lobbyists -- and Farrell in particular -- represent those institutions, and says killing a part of the legislation they supported constitutes standing up to Wall Street. Among the banks that Farrell represents is Bank of America, one of the nation’s largest. However the organization also includes small, local banks. Brenda Clement, executive director of the Housing Action Coalition of Rhode Island, made a point during the hearing of suggesting that most of Farrell’s clients are not Wall Street giants. "Mr. Farrell represents the Rhode Island Bankers Association who are in general not the problem in the foreclosure issue. Their membership [is] banks here in our community and they are working with us all the time," she said. The General Assembly went on to approve that legislation which Governor Carcieri then vetoed. When legislators returned in January, they overrode it. Farrell acknowledges that he asked Carcieri to veto the bill because it did not include the municipal preemption piece that legislators had promised. Given all that, does Segal’s sponsorship constitute a cracking down on "big Wall Street banks"? We understand that the banks he talks about played a major role in the mortgage crisis. But we see little evidence that Segal’s actions did anything to really crack down on those institutions. Requiring any bank -- Wall Street or Main Street -- to send a 45-day notification letter hardly equates to cracking down on them. Segal maintains that he sees no difference between fighting against foreclosures and "cracking down" on these companies. But words matter and his don’t reflect what he accomplished. Lastly, there is the issue of the language in Segal’s statement. Despite his phrasing, he did not pass this legislation himself. He sponsored the bill, along with four other representatives, that the legislative leadership then green-lighted for approval. It passed the House in a 48 to 19 vote, a wide enough margin for legislators to later override the veto. To say he passed it implies that he alone did the legwork and that’s just not how the General Assembly works. Segal’s measures in 2006 showed a foresight about a brewing problem and the gumption to try to do something about it. But his actions at the General Assembly in 2009 were nowhere near bold enough to warrant a claim that he cracked down on big Wall Street banks. We’re calling it Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11847	Under the House Republican tax proposal, "the average family of four earning median income ($59,000/year) will receive an additional $1,182 in their pocket every year."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2017/nov/06/drew-ferguson/georgia-congressman-says-gop-tax-bill-will-save-ty/	House Republicans have touted their tax bill as a plus for typical American families. In a constituent email forwarded to us by a reader, Georgia Rep. Drew Ferguson wrote, "This week the House released our tax reform legislation to help American families and level the playing field for the American worker. With this plan, the average family of four earning median income ($59,000/year) will receive an additional $1,182 in their pocket every year. Who wouldn't want American families to have more money in their pockets?" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The statement is exaggerating how long the average family of four will enjoy those tax savings. How the House Republican math works Ferguson’s office said that he had been citing comment from House Speaker Paul Ryan, whose office told us in a related check that the speaker had been referring to a House Ways and Means Committee analysis. That analysis calculated several scenarios for how the proposal’s changes could affect different types of taxpayers. The key elements of the Ways and Means calculation involved tax brackets, the standard deduction and the child tax credit. Currently, there are seven brackets; these would be consolidated into four -- 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent, and 39.6 percent. In the meantime, the standard deduction would be raised from $12,000 to $24,000. And the child tax credit would be increased from $1,000 to $1,600, bolstered by a new $300 credit for parents and other dependents. The example refers to a "family of four making $59,000 per year." Here’s the scenario outlined in the House’s fact sheet, using the fictional example of "Steve and Melinda" with two middle school-aged children: "As a result of lower tax rates, a significantly larger standard deduction, and an enhanced Child Tax Credit and Family Flexibility Credit, Steve and Melinda will pay over $1,182 less in taxes than last year, reducing their total tax bill from $1,582 to only $400. "That’s more money they can use for whatever is important to them, whether it’s paying bills, purchasing a new refrigerator, or putting away savings for the future." The Ways and Means Committee told PolitiFact that they chose a household income of $59,000 because it’s the median household income nationally. For that amount of income, a family today would get $12,700 from the standard deduction, $16,200 in personal exemptions, leaving $30,100 in taxable income. Of that, $18,650 would be taxed at 10 percent and $11,450 would be taxed at 15 percent, meaning the preliminary tax liability would be $3,582.50. That would be adjusted with $2,000 in child tax credits, producing a final tax liability of $1,582.50. Under the new tax bill, the family would take a larger $24,000 standard deduction (the proposal eliminates personal exemptions), leaving $35,000 in taxable income. At the 12 percent rate, that would mean $4,200 in preliminary liability. This would be offset by $3,200 in child tax credits and $600 in family credits, leaving a final tax liability of $400. That’s a $1,182.50 tax cut. So Ferguson has some mathematical detail to back up the figure. But that’s not the end of the story. Here are the two clearest caveats. Reduction of itemized deductions The GOP bill eliminates or shrinks a number of widely used itemized deductions, and those factors aren’t taken into account in the figure Ryan cited. The deductions eliminated or pared back in the bill include the mortgage interest deduction (for future mortgages, it would be capped at half its previous maximum); the state and local tax deduction (only $10,000 in property tax deductions would be allowed); the medical expense deduction; the casualty loss deduction; and the student loan interest deduction. Exchanging these changes for a higher standard deduction may benefit many taxpayers, particularly those who choose not to itemize today. For households earning around $59,000 a year, more taxpayers do take the standard deduction than take itemized deductions -- but a significant minority, about one-third, do itemize. For many itemizing taxpayers, those deductions are important -- and under the tax bill, they’re likely to end up worse off if the bill is passed as is, even with the higher standard deduction. For this type of taxpayer, the loss of even one of those deductions could conceivably wipe out that $1,182 gain for certain types of families. This specific amount of tax savings is good for just the first year Ferguson’s statement explicitly said that the $1,182 income boost would happen "every year." The problem is that the benefits of the tax proposal shrink, slowly but surely, over the next decade for this family. "The tax cut definitely dissipates over time," David Kamin, a tax and budget specialist at the New York University law school, told PolitiFact. Kamin cited a combination of factors, including the sunsetting of the $300 per parent tax credit; the lack of inflation adjustments for the child tax credit, which effectively replace personal exemptions that were indexed to inflation; and the new use of an inflation adjustment measure known as chained CPI, which grows more slowly than the yardstick in current use. According to Kamin’s calculations, the initial tax cut for the family making $59,000 becomes a $500 tax increase by 2024 compared to the status quo. Here’s the graph he put together: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com The way Ferguson described the cut was actually stronger than Ryan’s tax cut of "$1,182 a year." Amy Timmerman, Ferguson’s communications director, said that "the congressman misspoke last week when he cited Speaker Ryan’s example." Our ruling Ferguson said that under the House Republican tax proposal, "the average family of four earning median income ($59,000/year) will receive an additional $1,182 in their pocket every year." This is based on a plausible and transparent calculation, but Ferguson glossed over some context. The calculation doesn’t factor in several itemized deductions that would disappear under the proposal and that could have a significant impact on at least some "typical" families around that income level. And the statement is misleading when it says the family will save $1,182 "every year," since that’s the case in the first year only; after that, the benefit starts to shrink and eventually turns into a tax hike. We rate the statement Half True. EDITORS' NOTE, Nov. 6, 2017: We updated this story to remove a reference to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center of the tax plan.

pomt-04762	Says a portfolio managed by the Texas General Land Office earned 22 percent last year while the state’s emergency reserve account experienced a 1 percent gain.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/aug/28/jerry-patterson/jerry-patterson-says-investments-overseen-his-offi/	Criticizing a poke at his not releasing millions of dollars to support public schools, Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson said that doing so might cut into double-digit returns on investments managed by the General Land Office. In a letter he made public Aug. 22, 2012, Patterson, a Republican, said that those who want him to transfer $300 million in investment earnings to the State Board of Education for school needs do not understand the value of keeping such money invested so the state’s education endowment, the Permanent School Fund, continues to gain value. A pro-Democratic group, Progress Texas, accuses Patterson of inappropriately hoarding the millions. Patterson counters that the School Land Board, which he chairs, has discretion over whether to transfer the money and, he told us by telephone, it has until September 2013 to decide. His spokesman, Jim Suydam, also told us by email that the board approved a resolution in early 2011 to release $250 million of earnings in both 2012 and 2013 to the State Board of Education. In his letter, Patterson said that draining off additional earnings as Progress Texas says he must is a "bad choice... because last year the GLO-managed PSF earned 22 percent and, due to statutory liquidity requirements, the rainy day fund earned just 1 percent." He was comparing the portion of the Permanent School Fund managed by the land office to earnings on the state’s savings account, otherwise known as the Economic Stabilization Fund. "If your family needed a quick infusion of cash," Patterson wrote, "would you withdraw cash from the investment account earning 22 percent or the account earning 1 percent?" We’re not venturing that question, but wondered if Patterson made an accurate earnings comparison. Starting in 2005, the land office was given the authority to invest in real estate using proceeds received from selling lands or drawing on revenue from Permanent School Fund mineral leases and royalties, the agency notes on a web page. Professional fund management firms oversee the investments, the agency says, while the land board, consisting of the commissioner and two citizen appointees, manages the sale of Permanent School Fund land and mineral leases. To our inquiry, Suydam provided an agency report to the Legislature stating that through March 2012, the market value of the agency’s investments made from the Permanent School Fund was $3.077 billion, about half of that reflecting "externally managed direct real estate investments" and nearly $1.2 billion "attributable to short-term investments" in the state’s treasury, which Suydam later said means money set aside so it’s on call for the agency’s real estate investments. The report, dated Sept. 1, 2012, says that gross "time-weighted" returns on the portfolio in the 12 months through March amounted to nearly 22.9 percent, though that is without considering the short-term investments. Counting the cash-on-call portion, the report says, the time-weighted returns on the portfolio were 13.03 percent. "Time-weighted" returns? By email, Suydam told us the term describes a "complex calculation that uses values for every day in the period being measured" which, he said, explains why the 23 percent return shown for the real estate investments does not align with the 30 percent return that we calculated by comparing the market value of those investments at the end of March 2012 to the comparable figure at the end of March 2011. Asked how the earnings on real estate through March 2012 compare to recent 12-month periods, Suydam said such investments generated nearly 14 percent in market value in the 12 months through March 2011, but lost about 15 percent in the 12 months through March 2010. We checked on the rainy day fund’s earnings with Lauren Willis, spokeswoman for State Comptroller Susan Combs, who oversees state finances. Willis said by email that money in the reserve fund, created in 1988, is invested like other funds in the state’s treasury in stable, high-quality investments. In 2011, Willis said, the average yield on all those funds was 0.74 percent -- generating nearly $194 million in interest income including $51.9 million added to the rainy day fund. R.J. DeSilva, another Combs spokesman, said by email the rate of return might or might not have been about the same through the 12 months running through March 2012. In a telephone interview, we asked Patterson about why his letter mentions the higher returns on the real estate investments alone rather than also taking into account the lower returns influenced by the agency’s cash-on-call funds. "I don’t count the cash," Patterson replied, "because it’s not part of our investment portfolio." The land office, Patterson noted, is limited by law to managing just part of the overall education endowment. Suydam later said by email that as of the end of March, the market value of the agency’s portion of the PSF, not including the value of minerals or state-owned land, was nearly $3.1 billion. He said the State Board of Education oversaw the fund’s remaining $25.6 billion. Our ruling Patterson’s reference to 22 percent in earnings over the 12 months running through March 2012 does not account for reduced earnings from nearly $1.2 billion in cash-on-call money supporting the agency’s real estate investments. That clarification would be helpful, though it still seems reasonable, overall, to focus on the portion of the portfolio that would be expected to reap sizable gains. Separately, the claim seems to reflect the annual earnings on the rainy day fund, though the commissioner’s March-to-March time period does not match the calendar-year approach used by the state comptroller. We rate the statement as Mostly True.	None	Jerry Patterson	None	None	None	2012-08-28T10:00:00	2012-08-22	['None']
pomt-10508	Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama want to raise taxes on dividends, a move that would crash the stock market.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/24/chain-email/dividends-taxes-wont-crash-the-market/	A chain e-mail accuses Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama of wanting sharp tax increases, while praising Sen. John McCain for holding the line. ( Click here to read the chain e-mail in its entirety .) The e-mail asserts that Clinton and Obama want to raise capital gains taxes and dividends taxes, as well as raise tax rates for all income levels. We'll look at dividends taxes here. Dividends are payments that companies make to stockholders as a way of distributing profits. Before the Bush administration, dividends were taxed like normal income, with the rate for the wealthiest taxpayers reaching 39.6 percent. President Bush cut the tax rates on dividends to 15 percent, the same as capital gains taxes. Obama has said he will let the dividends tax cut expire so that dividends will be taxed at the same rate as normal income. We can't find an example of Clinton directly addressing the dividends tax, but she has spoken repeatedly about letting the Bush tax cuts expire for higher income taxpayers. Her campaign didn't respond to our questions. Here's what the e-mail states: "DIVIDEND TAX MCCAIN 15% (no change) OBAMA 39.6% CLINTON 39.6%" "How will this affect you?" the e-mail asks. "If you have any money invested in stock market, IRA, mutual funds, college funds, life insurance, retirement accounts, or anything that pays or reinvests dividends, you will now be paying nearly 40% of the money earned on taxes if Obama or Clinton become president. The experts predict that 'Higher tax rates on dividends and capital gains would crash the stock market yet do absolutely nothing to cut the deficit.'" The e-mail's explanation gets a few things wrong. Only taxpayers in the top bracket would pay 39.6 percent on dividends taxes. It's also unlikely that an increase in dividends taxes would crash the stockmarket. "That's hyperbolic," said William Ahern, a spokesman for the Tax Foundation, a progrowth tax policy think tank that opposes increases in dividends taxes. Another tax policy expert also shot down the stock-market-crash scenario: "Raising the dividend tax could cause some high income U.S. investors to move some of their wealth out of stocks, but all the analyses I have seen suggested the effect on the stock market would be small and would be swamped by changes in stock prices due to other causes," said Eric Toder, a tax policy expert with the Urban Institute. We find the e-mail gets its summary of the dividends tax only partially correct, though it is right that Obama specifically proposes an increase on the tax and Clinton has indicated she wants to let the Bush tax cuts expire for higher-income taxpayers. But Clinton hasn't staked out a specific change on the dividends tax and it's misleading for the e-mail to use one. And, the e-mail is wrong to suggest a change in the dividends tax would cause the stock market to crash. We rate its claims Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-15296	If women seeking an abortion see their ultrasound, "the odds are pretty high they're going to keep the baby."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jul/22/scott-walker/if-they-see-their-ultrasound-most-women-seeking-ab/	Two days after Gov. Scott Walker announced for president, conservative commentator Laura Ingraham wanted to know if the Wisconsin Republican planned to mislead voters. Interviewing the governor July 15, 2015 on her nationally syndicated radio show, Ingraham referred to a National Journal article that was published on the eve of Walker’s announcement. An anonymous longtime Walker adviser had said Walker would run as a conservative early in the campaign, then position himself as more moderate. "Is that what you’re going to do?" Ingraham asked. "Move to the middle after arguing that you’re the real conservative in this race?" Walker said no, and then went on to list a number of his accomplishments as governor that are important to conservatives. One is a law that requires women seeking an abortion to first get an ultrasound -- although they are not required to view it. "We know if people can see that unborn child, particularly with the latest technology, the odds are pretty high they’re going to keep the baby," Walker said. Do most women seeking an abortion change their mind after seeing their ultrasound scan? Previous fact check We’ve previously reviewed a claim similar to Walker’s. A couple of weeks before Walker signed the ultrasound requirement law in July 2013, conservative pundit Rachel Campos-Duffy, the wife of U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., said "upwards of 90 percent" of women seeking an abortion decide not to have an abortion after seeing an ultrasound. We rated her statement False. One anti-abortion organization claimed a figure of nearly 90 percent for its ultrasound program among a certain group of women. But there was no solid evidence to back Campos-Duffy’s claim, which was more sweeping than Walker’s. Evidence backing Walker Walker’s campaign cited two pieces of evidence that have surfaced since our Campos-Duffy fact check. 1. Anti-abortion group The first is a short news release issued in March 2015 by the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, which describes itself as a "national legal network of prolife pregnancy centers." The release described a survey that the group said it did of some of its centers. According to the release, 410 of the group’s 1,050 centers that offer ultrasounds responded to the survey. And in 75,318 cases in 2013 in which ultrasounds were given -- to what the group labeled as "abortion-minded" or "abortion-vulnerable" women -- 78 percent of the women decided against having an abortion. The release did not say whether there was follow-up to see if the women gave birth, which is what Walker claims. And like much of the evidence we reviewed in the Campos-Duffy fact check this evidence is self-reported by a group that actively advocates against abortion. 2. Academic study Walker’s campaign also cited an academic study published in January 2014 in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology. The researchers reviewed medical records for 15,575 visits by women seeking abortion care at Planned Parenthood clinics in Los Angeles in 2011. Among women who viewed their ultrasound images, over 98.4 percent of the pregnancies were terminated. But Walker’s campaign highlighted a narrower finding of the study. Some 93 percent of the women had entered the clinic expressing what the researchers characterized as a high degree of certainty that they wanted an abortion. Among the 7 percent who expressed medium or low certainty about their decision, viewing the ultrasound "was significantly associated with deciding to continue the pregnancy." But, clearly, that involves a small percentage of the women in the study. Two experts We spoke with one of the authors of the study, University of California at San Francisco School of Medicine professor Katrina Kimport; and with Michele Chadwick, executive director of the anti-abortion ICU Mobile, which is based in Akron, Ohio. They agreed on two points: 1. Neither had seen any peer-reviewed academic research to back Walker’s claim. 2. For some women, particularly those less sure about having an abortion, viewing an ultrasound can be one factor in deciding to continue a pregnancy. And often that decision to continue is not made simply as a result of viewing the ultrasound, but because counseling and other services are provided in addition to the scan. Kimport added that research shows the most common reason women state for getting an abortion is not being able to afford caring for a child, and viewing an ultrasound wouldn’t change that circumstance. Our rating Walker said that if women seeking an abortion see their ultrasound, "the odds are pretty high they're going to keep the baby." There is some evidence that some women considering an abortion opt to continue the pregnancy after seeing their ultrasound, although experts said that decision is typically based on counseling or other services that are offered along with the ultrasound. Meanwhile, the latest academic study we found shows that nearly all women who are more certain about their decision proceed with an abortion even after seeing the ultrasound. And we found no independent studies to back Walker’s statement. For a claim that has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-12822	Says "President Trump makes English the official language of the United States!"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/feb/09/blog-posting/donald-trump-did-not-make-english-official-languag/	A headline on an article posted on several websites falsely declares that President Donald Trump has made English the language of the land. "Breaking! President Trump makes English the official language of the United States!" the headline reads. It’s obvious in the story that follows, which discusses changes on the White House website, that something was lost in translation. We first saw the headline on DonaldTrumpPOTUS45.com on Jan. 26, 2017, but it has appeared on other sites in subsequent days. Facebook flagged the story as part of its efforts to combat fake news in user feeds. First off, English may be the de facto language of the United States, but the country has no designated official language. A majority of states do have laws making English their official language, albeit to varying degrees. Trump also did not elevate English in any official capacity, although he has certainly made it clear he would prefer citizens (including fluent Spanish speaker and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush) speak it. "Well, I think that when you get right down to it, we're a nation that speaks English," Trump said at a 2015 news conference. "I think that, while we're in this nation, we should be speaking English." This is a prime example of a certain type of fake news story that spins news of a real event, then slaps a provocative and largely unrelated headline on it in an attempt to draw eyeballs. In this case, the body of the story clearly advocates for adopting English as an official language, and says Trump should do so. But the only news event alluded to is about the official White House website losing its Spanish translation after Trump was inaugurated. The post cites an article from the Los Angeles Times, which points out the translation option had been removed from WhiteHouse.gov on Jan. 20. As of Feb. 9, the Spanish translation of the White House website was still gone. The story making the rounds on the Internet, meanwhile, says Trump purposely directed his administration to remove the translation. Even if that were true — and there’s no solid evidence that’s the case — it’s far from making English the nation’s official language. That would require legislation through Congress, which has been proposed in the past but never became law. This incendiary headline woefully misrepresents the actual event to which it is tied.

pomt-07011	"We have provided at least 16 tax cuts to small businesses."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/07/barack-obama/barack-obama-claims-credit-least-16-tax-cuts-small/	During a July 6, 2011, question-and-answer session on Twitter, President Barack Obama was asked -- in a tweet by House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio -- "After embarking on a record spending binge that left us deeper in debt, where are the jobs?" Part of Obama’s answer is that his administration has worked to aid small businesses in job creation. "We have provided at least 16 tax cuts to small businesses who have needed a lot of help and have been struggling -- including, for example, saying zero capital gains taxes on startups -- because our attitude is we want to encourage new companies, young entrepreneurs, to get out there, start their business, without feeling like if they’re successful in the first couple of years that somehow they have to pay taxes, as opposed to putting that money back into their business." This response echoed a comment we checked a few weeks earlier. In a face-off between the heads of the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee on NBC's Meet the Press on June 11, 2011, the discussion turned to what the government should be doing to accelerate job creation. "I think we need to cut taxes on small businesses," said RNC Chairman Reince Priebus. "Well, that's good," retorted DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., "because we've done that, 17 times." Here’s what we found when we looked at the question of small business tax cuts. When asked for supporting documents, the DNC press office pointed us to a Feb. 25, 2011, posting on the official White House blog titled "Seventeen Small Business Tax Cuts and Counting." The post enumerated 17 small business tax cuts and credits created or extended through legislation signed by Obama. Eight of them were included in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (more commonly known as the economic stimulus bill), the Affordable Care Act (also known as the health care law), and the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act (aka the HIRE Act). Among the cuts were the exclusion of up to 75 percent of capital gains on key small business investments; a tax credit for the cost of health insurance for small business employees and new tax credits for hiring Americans out of work for at least two months. Another eight cuts came via the Small Business Jobs Act, signed by Obama in September of 2010. These included: adding deductions for business cell phone use; creating a new deduction for health care costs for the self-employed; allowing greater deductions for business start-up expenses; eliminating taxes on all capital gains from key small business investments, and raising the small business expense limit to $500,000. Three months later, the president signed a tax bill that raised the expense limit to 100 percent of small business new investments until the end of 2011. It also extended the elimination of capital gains taxes for small business investments through the end of 2012. Here's the full list: From the Recovery Act, HIRE Acts, and Affordable Care Act: 1. A new small business health care tax credit 2. A new tax credit for hiring unemployed workers 3. Bonus depreciation tax incentives to support new investment 4. 75 percent exclusion of small business capital gains 5. Expansion of limits on small business expensing 6. Five-year carryback of net operating losses 7. Reduction of the built-in gains holding period for small businesses from 10 to 7 years to allow small business greater flexibility in their investments 8. Temporary small business estimated tax payment relief to allow small businesses to keep needed cash on hand From the Small Business Jobs Act: 9. Zero capital gains taxes on key investments in small businesses 10. Raising the small business expensing to $500,000 11. An extension of 50 percent bonus depreciation 12. A new deduction for health care expenses for the self-employed 13. Tax relief and simplification for cell phone deductions 14. An increase in the deduction for entrepreneurs’ start-up expenses 15. A five-year carryback of general business credits 16. Limitations on penalties for errors in tax reporting that disproportionately affect small business From the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act: 17. 100 percent expensing Conservative tax specialists don't quibble much with the list, but they did take issue with the context earlier this year when we asked them about the same claim by Wasserman Schultz. "I can't argue with any of these, but it ignores all the proposed and enacted tax hikes on small businesses," said Ryan Ellis, director of tax policy at Americans For Tax Reform, an anti-tax group headed by Grover Norquist. For example, Ellis said, it ignores President Obama's proposal to allow Bush-era individual income tax cuts to expire for those making more than $250,000. "A clear majority of small business profits are earned in households making at least $250,000 per year." Ellis said. "...That's a tax hike on the small business sector." (PolitiFact Virginia addressed a similar claim in this fact-check.) There are also a number of tax increases included in the health care law, Ellis said, some of which apply directly to small businesses. For one, he said, businesses with more than 50 employees could face a tax penalty if they don't provide enough health insurance to their employees. Another example, the 10 percent tanning tax, which he said is "nearly exclusively applied to small businesses." "So the overall story is much more of a problem for small firms than the Obama administration would suggest," Ellis said. Curtis Dubay, senior tax policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, allowed that "there have been targeted tax cuts for small businesses." But, he said, "it's an error to just point to the number of tax cuts. You have to look at the overall impact and that certainly has been steep tax hikes." Dubay also noted that six of the 17 cuts were not just for small businesses but were made widely available to all businesses. Richard Morrison at the Tax Foundation, a pro-business group, said that "nothing on (the White House list) stands out as egregiously unjustified from a fact-checking perspective. Some of them are temporary, and some aren’t targeted exclusively at small businesses, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they shouldn’t 'count' "as far as the claim is concerned." We think there's room for critics to note that in addition to the 17 tax cuts enumerated by the White House, there are there are also some tax increases in the health care law that will fall on some of the same small business owners that got tax cuts. Some health care law tax increases won't go into effect for a couple years. And with some, like the excise taxes on tanning beds, one could argue it is a tax on the customer, not the small business. As for allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire at the end of 2012, that's still just an Obama proposal; it hasn't happened. The only policy actually signed by the president so far was a compromise agreement that extended the tax cuts. On balance, we rated Wasserman Schultz's comment Mostly True. Because Obama’s comment is substantially similar, we also rate his comment Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-07-07T13:35:49	2011-07-06	['None']
pomt-13174	"Europe and U.S. households waste 15 times more food than a person in Africa."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/oct/27/foodmentum/advocacy-group-useurope-folks-waste-15x-more-food-/	We know we Americans have big issues with our waistlines, but are our issues with wasted food just as large? A recent tweet from FoodMentum, an anti-food waste advocacy website, says we do. "Europe and US households waste 15 times more food than a person in Africa," the Oct. 10, 2016, tweet said. A nice bit of statistical fodder for a fact-check, we thought. FoodMentum’s funder Maria Huszar told us she got the stat from a blog post on Foodtank, a food policy information clearinghouse. The article used slightly different words, but the gist was the same. "A European or North American consumer wastes 15 times more food than a typical African consumer," it said. Huszar acknowledged she swapped consumer for household. She also lumped Canada in with the United States, but our main concern was to check the accuracy of the gap between the two leading industrialized economic regions and Africa. A quick note here on what’s meant by food waste. That term refers to food that gets thrown in the trash, either by retailers -- think supermarkets and restaurants -- or consumers. That’s separate from food loss, which happens at farms, in transport, and at food-processing plants. Those products fall by the wayside due to spoilage or blemishes or wasteful production methods. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization commissioned a benchmark study on both losses and waste in 2011. It concluded that the per-capita food waste by consumers in Europe and North-America is between 95 and 115 kilograms a year. In sub-Saharan Africa and south and southeast Asia, it’s between 6 and 11 kilograms a year. Those numbers might seem clear. but they actually leave plenty of room for uncertainty. You can play with the ratios and get results that vary from more than 15, less than 15 and pretty close to 15. But most important for the claim we’re vetting, this study doesn’t give a clear estimate of food waste for sub-Saharan Africa alone. It gives a range that includes much of Asia. Vaclav Smil, professor emeritus at the University of Manitoba, Canada, told us there’s good reason to keep the figures vague. Smil, who has written many books and articles on the intersection of food, policy, energy and the environment, said too much data is missing. "All countries, except Japan, have only approximate, derived, assumed, secondary waste data," Smil said. While some work has been done in Europe and the United States, the U.S. Food and Agriculture Organization reported in 2013 that "there are currently no published studies available related to the exact amount of food waste in developing countries." Smil said the difference between North America and Europe compared to sub-Saharan Africa could fall anywhere between five and more than 12. All we can say for sure, according to Smil, is that the gap is large. Researcher Brian Lipinski at the World Resources Institute in Washington echoed that point. Lipinski said the more important point is that overall food losses occur very differently. "In the U.S. and Europe it's mostly on the consumer end," he said. "While in places like Africa, it's much more on the production end due to factors like pests, lack of adequate storage, and lack of infrastructure." More money = more food waste So why is food waste so much bigger in wealthier countries? As the authors of the 2011 report put it, those "people simply can afford to waste food." That waste takes place at many points. Supermarkets throw out fruits and vegetables that lose a bright fresh look. Restaurants serve portions that go beyond what most people can finish. As for what we do at home, a study in the United Kingdom found plenty of habits that make it more likely that food will end up in the trash. The list includes buying too much because we don’t know what we need and throwing out packaged food as soon as it goes past the printed expiration date, when it’s actually still fine to eat. Smil pointed to one telltale problem -- fewer people cook. "People who do not cook regularly have very poor control of their fridge contents and do a poor job of avoiding preventable losses," he said. And he added that even when people do cook, especially single people, they "engage in little reheating next day." By the way, Lipinski said his group doesn’t argue that if Americans and Europeans wasted less food it would help the nearly 800 million who don’t get enough around the world. It would save billions of gallons of water and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but that would do nothing to improve harvests and storage in places like sub-Saharan Africa.

pomt-00385	Says Amy McGrath "wants to fund more welfare for people who can work, but don’t."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/sep/07/congressional-leadership-fund/new-attack-ad-twists-mcgrath-stance-welfare-work-r/	Hannah Thornton, a single mom, sits in her kitchen and praises the GOP tax plan in a new ad running in Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District. As the screen cuts to a sepia-toned image of the U.S. Capitol building, Hannah says, "I don’t understand why Amy McGrath ... wants to fund more welfare for people who can work, but don’t." Amy McGrath, a former Marine fighter pilot, is the Democratic candidate running against incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Andy Barr in what is expected to be a November toss-up race. The two have sparred on the role that welfare, and specifically Medicaid, should play in Kentucky. The sponsor of the ad is the Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican PAC closely aligned with House Speaker Paul Ryan. We wanted to know whether McGrath has called for "more welfare" for people who can work, but don't. The Congressional Leadership Fund pointed us toward two instances in which, they say, McGrath supported welfare for those who are able to work but don’t: her stances on a Kentucky Medicaid waiver, and the 2018 farm bill. Key takeaways McGrath opposes work requirements for Medicaid and SNAP recipients. Right now, neither program requires recipients to work to get benefits. McGrath has no plans to extend welfare to more people; she has only advocated for maintaining the status quo. The Kentucky HEALTH conundrum In January 2018, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services approved a proposal from Kentucky leaders through the federal Medicaid waiver application process, in which states can submit proposals to use federal Medicaid funds in nontraditional ways. Under Gov. Matt Bevin's plan, called Kentucky HEALTH, adult Medicaid recipients would be required to work or volunteer to receive benefits, if they are able. In July, a federal judge blocked the measure, saying the proposal didn’t fully consider federal requirements for access to health care. But the idea behind it remains a talking point in the state’s politics. Barr has said that states should be able to set their own policies for health care, and supported the concept of work requirements for benefits, saying it could help recipients "achieve self-sufficiency." McGrath is against work requirements. "I value encouraging people to work, if they are able, but I fail to see why we are linking that to having health care," she said to Lex18, a local NBC affiliate. "We can't punish those who need assistance as a cruel way to cut the state budget." Currently, Kentucky’s Medicaid program does not have job requirements. McGrath’s opposition to Kentucky HEALTH does not necessarily mean she wants to expand Medicaid to cover more people, or to make easier for those without jobs to receive insurance, as the ad claims. Instead, she supports the status quo: providing Medicaid to low-income Kentuckians, even those without jobs. Farm tax, food stamps The Congressional Leadership Fund also pointed us to the 2018 farm bill, which included new regulations for food stamps, known as SNAP. Under the initial draft of the bill, SNAP recipients would be required to work or do job training at least 20 hours per week. The farm bill has not yet become law. The version with work requirements was passed by the House in June 2018. The Senate passed their version just a week later, but they removed the controversial work requirements. McGrath, who by this point had retired from teaching at the Naval Academy to campaign full-time, tweeted a critique of the work requirements, saying they "would take away SNAP assistance to thousands of veterans and active duty military families who rely on these benefits." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Andrew S. London, professor of sociology at Syracuse University, studies the relationship between SNAP benefits and the military. He said there is support for McGrath’s notion that a work requirement might lead to reduced benefits going to a subpopulation of veterans. "Our research suggests that SNAP use among veterans and reserve/guard who are either unemployed or not in the labor force is substantial," he said. Much like the Medicaid debate, McGrath isn’t pushing for more welfare for unemployed Americans. Instead, she wants to keep eligibility requirements as they currently are, allowing many people — including unemployed veterans — to keep their benefits. Our ruling An ad by the Congressional Leadership Fund says that McGrath "wants to fund more welfare for people who can work, but don’t." This is exaggerated, and it hinges on the use of "more" to create a deceptive picture about her position. McGrath spoke out against the Kentucky HEALTH plan, which would have required Medicaid recipients to work or do community service in order to receive benefits. She also objected to the House version of the 2018 farm bill, which would have imposed stricter work requirements on SNAP recipients. However, in both instances, McGrath hasn’t called for more welfare. Rather, she opposes imposing work requirements and disqualifying some current recipients. McGrath has said she wants to keep the status quo on welfare, not to increase it or make it easier for people not to work. The statement is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.

pomt-02513	Kip Kinkel and Clackamas Town Center shootings "both where citizen with gun stopped the crime"	false	/oregon/statements/2014/feb/12/oregon-citizens-lobby/were-kip-kinkel-and-clackamas-town-center-shooting/	Gun-control proposals, both in Oregon and nationally, continue to generate controversy. Even ideas with widespread public support, such as universal background checks, ignite fierce debates. That much was clear Feb. 6, 2014, when Mark Kelly, the husband of former Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords -- who was critically injured in a 2011 shooting -- testified at an Oregon legislative hearing in favor of a bill that would expand background checks. A member of the Oregon Citizens Lobby, a conservative activist group, took to Twitter to say that Kelly was testifying. The tweet indicated that Kelly’s remarks included mention of Kip Kinkel, who shot and killed his parents before killing two fellow Thurston High School students in 1998, and the Dec. 11, 2012, shooting at Clackamas Town Center that left three people, including the shooter, dead. "He mentions Kip Kinkle (sic) & Clackamas TC," the tweet continued, "both where citizen with gun stopped the crime." The tweet caught our attention. Were both of those tragic incidents halted when armed citizens intervened? PolitiFact Oregon checked. We checked the Oregon Citizens Lobby’s website but found it contains no phone numbers. It does list email contacts for subjects including health care, taxes, education and "law enforcement, military and firearms." We emailed the latter and received a reply from someone who identified himself only as "Bill D., Team lead, Oregon Citizens Lobby, Law Enforcement, Military and Firearms." (In a subsequent email, he declined to give his full name.) Regarding the Town Center shooting, Bill D. wrote, "Clackamas Mall is easy...the Oregonian covered it well." The email provided a link to a story in The Oregonian and on OregonLive.com, which reported the account of Nick Meli, who told authorities he trained his own gun on mall shooter Jacob Tyler Roberts. Meli didn’t shoot for fear of hitting a bystander, according to one of several statements he gave to police and reporters. The story added that Meli also told a local television station that Roberts appeared to spot him "and that afterward, Meli heard only one more shot, and suspects it was the one Roberts used to kill himself." Bill D.’s email then addressed the Thurston High School shooting. It retracted that part of the initial tweet, saying: "...other students (unarmed) tackled Kip Kinkel. The tweet was likely in error here." So far, the group, was batting .500 on the original tweet’s accuracy. We agree that no one with a gun stopped Kinkel. News accounts and official reports show that brothers Jake and Josh Ryker and classmate Tony Case tackled Kinkel while he was trying to reload and held him until police arrived. To fact-check Meli’s role in the Town Square shootings, we called the Clackamas County Sheriff’s Office, which took the lead in investigating the incident. "It’s inconclusive on our end," said Lt. Robert Wurpes, office spokesman. "We can’t say either way whether he did or did not make a difference. It would only be speculation." Other news accounts in the days after the shooting indicated that Meli changed his story slightly. According to police reports, Meli’s first contact with deputies took place as the search for Roberts was still unfolding. Meli had a handgun out when officers first saw him. He provided information about the shooter but did not mention a confrontation with Roberts. The next day, Meli told police he saw Roberts and drew his gun but didn’t fire out of fear of striking someone. The day after that, Meli added that Roberts looked at him and saw that Meli saw him before running off, according to a story by Rick Bella of The Oregonian. After that, Meli cut interviews short. His silence, Bella wrote, "has effectively divided the public into two camps: One that believes Meli is a hero, a good guy with a gun who stopped a bad guy with a gun, preventing further bloodshed. The other believes Meli embellished his story to take undue credit." When we emailed the Oregon Citizens Lobby for a response, "BD" responded by writing: "Cops will not declare that a private citizen stopped a shooting unless the evidence is absolutely incontrovertible. Quotes from them are usually taken before an investigation is complete and they of course don’t want to prejudice the investigation." A member of the Oregon Citizens Lobby tweeted during a gun-control hearing that the Thurston and Clackamas Town Center shootings were stopped by armed bystanders. The Oregon Citizens Lobby acknowledged it erred in the Thurston case. Nick Meli’s role at Clackamas Town Center remains open to debate. Did his drawn weapon prompt the shooter to flee? There is no proof that it did. We rate the claim False. After publication, we heard from Tony Case, who told us he was shot by Kinkel and that he did not help tackle the shooter. News accounts at the time differ, but we are the first to acknowledge that Case is in a position to know. Return to OregonLive.com/politics to comment on this ruling.

pomt-09129	Says she was never a member of the Georgia Log Cabin Republicans.	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2010/jun/16/karen-handel/did-handel-ever-joing-log-cabin-republicans/	Karen Handel, who wants to become the state’s first female governor, is getting a high-profile education in Republican primary politics -- bare-knuckled Georgia style. One of Handel’s opponents, former U.S. Rep. Nathan Deal, has publicly attacked Handel for her cozy relationship with the gay community earlier in her political career when she was campaigning for the Fulton County Commission and later its chairmanship. Among other things, Deal has alleged Handel was a member of the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay rights GOP organization that endorsed both her 2002 and 2003 election bids. Handel and her strategists have repeatedly denied she was ever a member of the group, including in a June 9 article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. In the article, Marc Yeager, who was president of the Georgia group in 2002 and 2003, said that Handel was a “dues-paying member of the Georgia Log Cabin Republicans from 2002 to 2004, something Handel also denies.” Deal continues to insist Handel was a member. So who’s telling the truth? To understand what’s going on here, you have to turn back the political clock seven or eight years. Back to very different campaigns. Handel was then seeking a job where Fulton County’s large and politically active gay community was a key constituency. The support of that community is vital to anyone seeking office locally. Both Republicans and Democrats aggressively court the gay vote. But in a statewide Republican primary, the dynamics change dramatically, tilting strongly conservative. In statewide races, the clout of gay voters fades. In a statewide Republican primary, the conservative vote moves to the forefront. And that vote can easily be a decisive factor in a multicandidate contest like the one in which Deal and Handel find themselves. Deal is trying to paint Handel as overly friendly with Atlanta’s gay community in an effort to cut into the most conservative part of her voter base. Make no mistake, this is a fight to the finish. At most, only two candidates of the seven running will emerge from the July 20 GOP primary. Deal’s camp has gone for Handel’s jugular over her outreach to gay voters. And Deal’s strategists think they smell blood. Handel’s camp has responded by accusing Deal of having a “history of bigoted remarks.” A news release by the Handel camp late last week said this: “When he [Deal] found out that 8 years ago Karen Handel spoke to the Log Cabin Republicans ... it sent him into a month-long, delusional attack against her.” Deal has, among other things, accused Handel of supporting “gay adoption” during her Fulton County Commission bids. There is scant evidence of that, and PolitiFact Georgia has previously given the former congressman a “Barely True” on the Truth-O-Meter for that accusation. But the paper and electronic trail on Handel and the Log Cabin Republicans is much stronger. The Southern Voice, a newspaper that catered to the gay community and later went bankrupt, carried numerous articles about Handel’s 2002 and 2003 commission runs. And in those she is repeatedly identified as a member of the Georgia Log Cabin Republicans. Handel never asked for a correction or clarification. Handel spokesman Dan McLagan agrees with that last point. “The Southern Voice is going to say all kinds of wacky stuff,” McLagan said. “The fact a retraction was not asked for is not proof of the assertion. She probably wasn’t sitting around reading a gay tabloid.” McLagan added: “She doesn’t remember ever having been a member.” But Yeager, the Log Cabin leader at the time, said he does remember. “Karen handed me the check [for her membership dues],” he said during an interview with PolitiFact Georgia. And he happens to be a guy who keeps a record of his e-mails. One of those, from Yeager to Log Cabin board member Cathy Dudley in March 2003, contains an attachment -- a mailing list for the hundred or so Georgia Log Cabin members at that time. The list was being used to mail monthly invites to Log Cabin meetings. Handel’s name, telephone numbers, e-mail address and home address are on that list, which was examined by PolitiFact Georgia. It clearly lists her as a dues-paying member whose membership ran through July 2003. Another attachment in a later e-mail listed her as a member through July 2004. McLagan was unimpressed. He suggested that Jamie Ensley, the current president of the Georgia Log Cabin Republicans, had membership records indicating Handel was not a member of the group. Unlike Yeager, however, Ensley declined to share membership records with PolitiFact Georgia. “Under no circumstances can I share our memberships rolls,” Ensley said. McLagan, meanwhile, questioned the motives of Yeager, who is no longer with the Log Cabin Republicans. McLagan said Yeager’s partner is an Obama supporter. Yeager said that is true, but he stands by his statements and e-mails about Handel’s earlier membership in the Log Cabin Republicans. “My partner, Roger, ... applied for becoming an Obama delegate early in the process but never pursued it due to the time required for the whole nomination and delegate process,” Yeager said in an e-mail to the AJC. “I don’t think he ever went to any meetings. Certainly it has been no secret that he always has been and still is a Democrat. This was always a point of curiosity within the gay press with me being president of Georgia LCR [Log Cabin Republicans].” ‘Nuf said, or so says McLagan. “These guys have an agenda,” McLagan said. Handel, however, is running against fellow Republicans at this point in the race, not Democrats. And it is a fellow Republican who has accused her of belonging to the Log Cabin Republicans. What about Yeager’s e-mails that show Handel’s name appeared on the Log Cabin Republicans’ membership roll? They certainly appear genuine. “I can type up an e-mail that says anything,” McLagan said. Perhaps. But the evidence is overwhelming that Handel did indeed belong to the Georgia Log Cabin Republicans -- whether or not she remembers it. Newspapers reported it. A membership list backs it up. And the man running the organization at the time swears by it. Handel and her handlers, however, still choose to deny it. This might have rated a False on the Truth-O-Meter. But the complex dance Handel has engaged in over this issue moves it up a notch. Seems the metro Atlanta temperatures aren’t the only thing a bit overheated these days. We give her a Pants On Fire.

pomt-10024	"A middle-class family donates $1 to charity, they get 15 cents off their income tax. Bill Gates donates $1 to charity, he takes 35 cents off his income tax."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/11/robert-gibbs/No-wonder-the-rich-give-so-much-to-charity/	In defending President Obama's plan to reduce tax deductions for high earners, the White House has said the tax code is tilted toward rich guys. They've understated the case considerably. We'll explain how in a bit. First, some background: The issue arose when Obama proposed reducing the percentage of charitable contributions that taxpayers who earn more than $250,000 can take as a tax deduction, from 35 to 28 percent. That would raise about $318 billion toward Obama's proposed $634 billion "reserve fund" to be used to reform health care, according to Obama's budget proposal. Critics, including some Republicans and nonprofit executives, don't like the idea. At a White House news briefing, Jake Tapper of ABC News said the proposal was controversial and asked White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, "Are you willing to consider a different revenue stream than that tax increase to fund health care?" "Well, I do think all issues are on the table," Gibbs replied. "Let's, though, just discuss the — I assume you're talking about the charitable contribution — I mean, a middle-class family donates a dollar to charity, they get 15 cents off their income tax. Bill Gates donates a dollar to charity, he takes 35 cents off his income tax. The proposal that the White House has would simply reduce those levels to the same levels that we saw during the Reagan administration." Budget director Peter Orszag made the same argument in this blog post . Let's walk through how charitable deductions impact taxes. If you donate $1 to charity, you can list that as a deduction, meaning you can subtract $1 from your income before calculating your taxes. High earners like Bill Gates pay a tax rate of 35 percent on the portion of their income that is over about $350,000. So if they subtract $1 from their taxable income, their tax burden drops by 35 percent of $1, which is 35 cents. By contrast, couples with taxable income between $16,700 and $67,900 pay a top tax rate of 15 percent. If they make that same $1 contribution, and subtract the $1 from their income, their tax burden falls by just 15 percent of $1, or 15 cents. Gibbs' point rests on the contention that couples making between $16,700 and $67,900 are middle class, which we believe is fair — the median household income in the U.S. is $50,233 . So Gibbs was right, except that he understated the case. Here's how: First, you can't take any deduction for a charitable contribution unless you itemize your taxes. Folks in the 15 percent tax bracket are unlikely to do so, while rich folks are very likely to. Only 35 percent of all taxpayers itemized their taxes in 2004, but 87 percent of taxpayers in the top 10 percent were itemizers, according to the Urban Institute . We're not going to penalize Gibbs for understating his case, because his numbers hold true when comparing two taxpayers who itemize, and he confined his comment to the income tax. It's worth noting that the rich only enjoy bigger deductions because they pay more taxes — a top tax rate of 35 percent instead of 15 percent, and an estate tax on top of that. But it's also true that a charitable contribution of, say, $1,000 will take a much bigger bite out of a middle-class person's income than a high earner's. That's all academic though. The bottom line is that Gibbs' number are accurate. We find this claim to be True.	None	Robert Gibbs	None	None	None	2009-03-11T17:31:43	2009-03-05	['Bill_Gates']
pomt-01722	"It cost us more to shut the government down than to keep it open."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/07/rand-paul/rand-paul-rightly-says-government-shutdown-was-mor/	This week, Rand Paul is on a 10-stop tour of Iowa, seen by many as a trial run for a 2016 presidential campaign. He’s been touting out his campaign positions, such as raising the retirement age and trying to play up his support for Israel. In a speech in Iowa City Tuesday, stumping for Republican House candidate Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Paul spoke about what he sees as out-of-control government spending. He also talked about the government shutdown last fall. Paul voted against the budget deals that led to the shutdown, but he said he thought shutting down the government was a "bad idea." And he carried the same position in Iowa this week. "It cost us more to shut the government down than to keep it open," Paul said. "You know your government’s dysfunctional if it costs more to shut it down than to keep it open, because we paid all these people." Coming from someone like Paul, who has been known to oppose government spending, that comment intrigued us. (We noticed it when Yahoo! News political reporter Chris Moody, who was there, tweeted it out.) The economics Paul’s comment referred to the 2013 government shutdown, which lasted just over two weeks from Oct. 1 to Oct. 16. During those two weeks, up to 850,000 workers were furloughed per day, national parks shut their doors, government-funded scientific research halted, and various health and safety inspections -- out of agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration -- were put on hold. So how does not spending money come at a cost? "Sen. Paul was making the point that the government never actually shut down during the so called 'shutdown,'" a spokesman told us. "Even though some government employees were furloughed, salaries were still paid for those who didn't work and government had to pay interest on late payments." We found that this was true. The government still functioned partially during the shutdown, and furloughed employees got back pay. On top of doling out delayed payments, the government faced late payment penalties and other logistical costs associated with preparing or recuperating from two weeks of stalled activity. They also lost revenue from national parks and museums. But a more significant and documented blow was to the economy as a whole. We found a solid consensus among economists that the shutdown was expensive to the U.S. economy in terms of actual costs and lost productivity. The most thorough report examining the shutdown came out of Nov. 7, 2013, from the Office of Management and Budget, which reports directly to the president. (Paul’s spokesman pointed us to this New York Times article about the White House report as evidence.) Here’s a few highlights: $2.5 billion in compensation costs for furloughed workers (whose lack of pay for two weeks hampered consumer spending); 120,000 fewer private-sector jobs created in the first half of October; $500 million lost in visitor spending because of closed National Parks ; $11 million in lost National Parks and Smithsonian Institution revenue; Interest accrued on billions of dollars of payments owed to third parties that the government was unable to pay during the shutdown; Resources spent on putting activities in standby or maintaining them in an idle mode; 1.2 million Internal Revenue Service identity verification requests that couldn’t be processed, causing a delay in private-sector lending and other activities; Stalled approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration delayed moving products to market. We also found estimates from financial analytics companies in the private sector. All of these (about a dozen) showed a negative effect on the economy, though. Most of the estimates predicted that the shutdown would not affect the economy’s growth path substantially. (The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service compiled the reports in 2013.) Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics, said the shutdown stunted fourth quarter GDP growth by 0.5 points, resulting in a $20 billion hit. The shutdown disrupted federal spending, global trade and investments in housing and businesses. Additionally, in the shutdown’s aftermath, consumers held back spending and foreign confidence in the American economy waned. Standard and Poor's said the shutdown took $24 billion out of the economy and reduced yearly fourth quarter GDP growth by 0.6 percent. (In December, the comic strip Doonesbury referenced this report, and we rated it Mostly True.) Macroeconomic Advisers (in a report for the Peterson Foundation) estimated the shutdown cut 0.3 points off of fourth-quarter growth, "mainly by interrupting the flow of services produced by federal employees." The Macroeconomic Advisers report said private-sector effects were limited, especially because the furloughed workers received back pay. Bloomberg News surveyed 71 economists and found the median GDP growth projection immediately after the shutdown was 0.4 points lower than a survey conducted a month earlier. The counterargument In consulting experts and scouring shutdown coverage, we found no economic modeling or analysis that showed the economy staying neutral or experiencing positive growth as a result of the shutdown. Some libertarians argue -- such as economist Jeff Dorfman for Forbes -- that just because the government didn’t spend money for two weeks doesn’t mean that the same amount of money didn’t get spent elsewhere in the private sector, though he did not provide data or other proof that this was happening. Dan Mitchell of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, made a similar argument, but offered a caveat -- that when government spending is suddenly reduced, the economy doesn’t instantaneously recalibrate itself, so there can be economic "bumps" in the immediate aftermath -- such as what was seen in the shutdown. Our ruling: Paul said, "It cost us more to shut the government down than to keep it open." Numerous independent economic research groups found that the shutdown resulted in overall costs, in terms of lost revenue, hindered GDP growth, stalled private-sector activity and actual expenditures associated with the logistics of closing the government for two weeks. The government had to pay all of what it normally would have spent during that two-week period and then some. There was very little evidence to the contrary. We rate this claim True.

Because next April you’re going to, in many cases, (file) one page, one card. It’s going to be very, very different. Very, very different."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/09/donald-trump/can-taxpayers-expect-card-sized-tax-forms-file-nex/	If you are struggling to finish and file your taxes right now, something President Donald Trump said during a recent visit to West Virginia probably sounds like a godsend. "This will be the last time — April — that you’re going to (fill out) that old-fashioned, big, lots of pages, complicated tax form," Trump said during his April 5 visit. "Because next April you’re going to, in many cases, (file) one page, one card. It’s going to be very, very different. Very, very different." Trump was focused on this point, saying at another occasion during the event, "You’ll have a nice, simple form next year. This will be the last year. So take pictures of it and enjoy it. This is the last time you’ll have to file a very complex and big tax form. It will be much easier starting next April." But Trump’s assurance is dubious. There isn’t an option today for filing taxes on a "card" — and there’s nothing in the new law that would create one. The idea for this popped up in November. House Republicans touted their plan as one that could be accommodated by a postcard-sized form. The president liked the idea so much that he held one up and kissed it for the cameras when meeting with lawmakers at the White House. "It's going to make life very simple," he said Nov. 2, 2017. "The only people that aren't going to like this is H&R Block. They're not going to be very happy. That's probably one of the only companies in the country that's not going to be thrilled." In the end, the bill didn't require this. There is already a pretty easy way to file your tax returns, the 1040EZ form. It looks like this, with just one page to fill out: "While it’s not postcard-sized, it’s pretty simple, and whatever they end up with in the future will probably look a lot like that currently does," said Patrick Newton, a spokesman for the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, told us in December. The 1040EZ is also popular. According to IRS statistics for the 2015 tax year, 23.3 million tax filers used the 1040EZ. That’s about one of every six filers. Could the number of people using the 1040EZ increase in 2019 due to the tax bill’s passage? When we checked with the White House, they told us that Trump was referring to increases in the standard deduction and the curtailment of the alternative minimum tax for many taxpayers, results that should simplify tax filings for many Americans. Before the new law took effect, about 70 percent of filers used the standard deduction, said John Buhl, a spokesman for the Tax Foundation. "With the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in place, we estimate that could increase to about 90 percent of filers," he said. "Using the standard deduction rather than itemizing certainly makes filing taxes a simpler process." However, Buhl added, "the basic forms and process for submitting a return either with the standard deduction or with itemized deductions will not change much. So we aren’t at the point of just needing a postcard." Meanwhile, some filers could actually see greater complexity than in the past, Buhl said. "There are new pass-through business deduction rules looming that could provide an additional tax cut for some, but likely make their filings more complex," he said. Joseph Rosenberg, senior research associate at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, has told us that the number of 1040EZ users might increase on the margins, but added that "there are relatively few people who currently itemize who have a simple enough situation" to shift to the 1040EZ. Our ruling Trump said, "This will be the last time — April — that you’re going to (fill out) that old-fashioned, big, lots of pages, complicated tax form. Because next April you’re going to, in many cases, (file) one page, one card. It’s going to be very, very different. Very, very different." There is no new card- or postcard-filing option in the pipeline due to the law passed last December. As it happens, simpler filing options already exist and are widely used — but tax experts do not expect a surge in their use as a result of the tax bill in April 2019.

Here’s what Greene left out: The federal government has already reimbursed local law enforcement agencies for protecting Trump. And while the next governor could send a bill to the federal government, it would likely end up in the shredder. Florida’s costs reimbursed Greene’s spokeswoman pointed to a Palm Beach Post article that found local law enforcement agencies fronted more than $5.7 million to help protect Trump between November 2017 and April 2018. Most of that money was spent by the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office, while smaller amounts were spent by West Palm Beach and Palm Beach police departments. However, the federal government has already established a process for reimbursement. The Presidential Residence Protection Assistance Grant provided $41 million to reimburse state and local law enforcement agencies for costs incurred between Jan. 21, 2017, and Sept. 30, 2017, while protecting Trump’s residences in Florida, New York and New Jersey. The Federal Emergency Management Agency administers these funds. In 2017, the largest grant recipient was the New York City Police Department, which helps guard Trump Tower. The department received about $36 million. In Palm Beach County, the sheriff’s office received $3.3 million, the full amount it sought for reimbursement, according to Therese Barbera, a sheriff spokeswoman. The town of Palm Beach received $71,000 and West Palm Beach received $63,000. In a neighboring county, the Broward Sheriff’s Office also received money. Local law enforcement agencies can submit their next requests for federal reimbursement in October. While Greene cited Trump’s visits to play golf, Trump doesn’t only play golf while in Palm Beach County. Trump has conducted some business while in South Florida, including hosting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Mar-A-Lago. But he is clearly a fan of golf. PolitiFact’s Trump Golf Tracker showed that as of May 18, 2018, he had at least 56 confirmed golf outings, including some in Florida. (Our tabulation could be an undercount since it is based on confirmed golf outings. The New York Times has tracked how many times Trump has visited his properties, including golf courses, which adds up to 170 as of mid-July.) Governor’s power to bill the federal government limited Greene said he would put a stop to this. We can't fact-check whether he will, because that's a prediction. But we can analyze whether the governor has control. Campaign spokeswoman Claire VanSusteren pointed to a line in Article 7 Section 1 in the Florida Constitution that states, "No money shall be drawn from the treasury except in pursuance of appropriation made by law." We sent Greene’s constitutional argument to a few Florida legal experts: Nova Southeastern University law professor Robert Jarvis; Talbot "Sandy" D’Alemberte, a former president of the American Bar Association and former president of Florida State University; and Raoul Cantero, a former Florida Supreme Court judge and a partner at White and Case law firm. The experts would essentially say to Greene: Good luck with that. This portion of the Florida Constitution is about taxation — the state budget says nothing about relations with the federal government. There is nothing in that section that would compel the federal government to comply with such a request from a governor. Jarvis said that a state governor has no power over a president. "This is because of a legal doctrine known as the ‘superior sovereign doctrine.’ Under it, a lower government official cannot order a higher government official to do anything," he said. "This stems from medieval times, when a king could order a prince to do things, but a prince could not order a king to do anything. In our country, this means that the states are subservient to the federal government." Our ruling Greene said, "Every time Trump comes here to play golf, Florida taxpayers are paying for it. Millions wasted in road closures and overtime. Jeff Greene will put a stop to that day 1." Local law enforcement in Palm Beach County have spent millions on security when Trump visits, but they have submitted their costs for reimbursement, and will continue to do so. Greene cites a portion of the Florida Constitution about taxation that he says he would use to submit a bill to the federal government. He could certainly try that, but the legal experts we talked to said that’s not the purpose of that part of the Constitution. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-12969	Says President Barack Obama "has not condemned" shootings targeting police.	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2016/dec/27/larry-pratt/pants-fire-larry-pratt-says-obama-hasnt-decried-ki/	Larry Pratt, the longtime leader of Gun Owners of America, says President Barack Obama has been nonchalant about ambush shootings targeting police. "There have been officers simply gunned down because they had a uniform on," Pratt said during a Dec. 15 radio interview on WINA in Charlottesville. "It’s not just Dallas, it’s other places as well and the thing that frankly concerns me as I think about this is that the president not only has not condemned this, he actually seems to have a rationale that maybe this is what you would expect in the United States with its history of slavery and racial impression and so forth. "That doesn’t help in the here and now," added Pratt, a Republican who represented Fairfax County in the General Assembly in the early 1980s. "We don’t have slavery and we don’t have racial oppression, but we do have cops getting killed." We wondered whether Pratt, whose organization is headquartered in Fairfax County and has criticized the NRA as being soft on gun rights, was correct that Obama never "condemned" the murders of police. So we examined the records and found three statements by Obama that decimate Pratt’s claim. Dallas On the night of July 7, 2016, a sniper killed five Dallas policemen and wounded seven in the deadliest attack for police since 9/11. The assassin, before dying at the scene, said he was angered by the fatal police shootings of black men in Louisiana and Minnesota that had dominated national news in previous days. Obama denounced the sniper’s acts the next morning as "a vicious, calculated and despicable attack on law enforcement." He added, "I believe that I speak for every single American when I say that we are horrified over these events and that we stand united with the people and the police department in Dallas." The president also said, "There is no possible justification for these kinds of attacks or any violence against law enforcement." Obama was in Europe at the time to attend a NATO Summit and to hold meetings with leaders in Poland and in Spain. He cut short the trip by one day to speak at a memorial service in Dallas for the slain policemen. Baton Rouge Three Baton Rouge law enforcement officers were ambushed and shot to death on July, 17, 2016. The assassin, who was killed at the scene, had vowed in an email to avenge the recent police killings of blacks. Obama issued a statement that day that said, "For the second time in two weeks, police officers who put their lives on the line for ours every day were doing their job when they were killed in a cowardly and reprehensible assault. These are attacks on public servants, on the rule of law, and on civilized society, and they have to stop." New York Two New York City policemen sitting in their patrol car were shot at point blank range on Dec. 20, 2014. The New York Times reported that the murderer, who committed suicide near the scene, had made statements on social media that he planned to avenge police killings of black men earlier that year in Ferguson, Mo. and New York. Obama issued a written statement that day that actually used the word "condemn." He wrote: "I unconditionally condemn today's murder of two police officers in New York City. Two brave men won't be going home to their loved ones tonight, and for that, there is no justification. The officers who serve and protect our communities risk their own safety for ours every single day - and they deserve our respect and gratitude every single day. Tonight, I ask people to reject violence and words that harm, and turn to words that heal - prayer, patient dialogue, and sympathy for the friends and family of the fallen." We asked Pratt if he had second thoughts about his comment about Obama. "Nah," he replied, saying the president’s statements deploring the attacks on police have been tempered by other comments Obama has made legitimizing the distrust many blacks have of police officers. For example, Obama said on July 7, 2016, that while most police perform admirably, there are racial "biases, some conscious and unconscious, that have to be rooted out." Pratt told us that Obama "has stirred the pot," on attacking police. "He’s looking for division." We should finally note that Pratt is not the first to accuse Obama of being aloof about the attacks on police. Our colleagues at PunditFact on July 8, 2016, examined a similar comment by William Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police Officers. They rated it Pants on Fire. Our ruling Pratt said Obama never "condemned" murders targeting police. His outrageous statement ignores the president’s expressions of abhorrence following each of three different ambush murders of multiple police officers in the last two years. Obama publicly called the killings "vicious," "reprehensible," "cowardly," and "despicable." Following the 2014 slaying of two New York policemen, Obama used the very word Pratt denies him, saying, "I unconditionally condemn" the murders. We rate Pratt’s claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-14773	In the weekend after the terrorist attacks in Paris, the White House said "this couldn't happen in the United States. ISIS couldn't reach us here."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/dec/08/joe-scarborough/joe-scarborough-says-days-after-paris-attack-white/	President Barack Obama seems "clueless" on the threat of the Islamic State, said MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough. "First of all he won’t even call it Islamic radicalism," Scarborough said on Morning Joe Dec. 4, the day after the deadly terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif. "His White House said, the weekend of Paris, that this couldn't happen in the United States. ISIS couldn't reach us here." It’s accurate that Obama doesn’t call ISIS "Islamic radicalism" or "Islamic extremism." A reader asked us to look into the second part of Scarborough’s statement: that in the days following the Friday, Nov. 13 terrorist attack in Paris, the Obama administration said an ISIS attack couldn’t happen in the United States. An MSNBC spokesperson directed us to comments made by Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, on ABC’s This Week on Nov. 15. But they don’t back up Scarborough’s claim in the least. In the interview, Rhodes said there was no known credible threat to the United States at that moment. He did not say there wasn’t any possibility of ISIS-backed terrorism on U.S. soil whatsoever. Rhodes immediately followed up by pointing out that ISIS has "aspirations to attack the United States." Host George Stephanopoulos: "And is there any intelligence suggesting a specific and credible threat to the homeland? I know yesterday there was none. Has anything new developed there?" Rhodes: "No, George, the president had a meeting yesterday that included the secretary of Homeland Security, the director of the FBI. Our determination is there's not a specific, credible threat to the homeland at this time. But we're going to be very vigilant because we know ISIL has the aspirations to attack the United States as well as our European and other allies and partners." Rhodes added later that one focus of Obama’s meetings with foreign leaders that weekend was "how we can seal that border with Turkey to prevent that flow of foreign fighters and share intelligence to disrupt and prevent attacks in our European allies' countries and, of course, in the United States." So this Rhodes interview doesn’t support Scarborough’s point; rather, Rhodes plainly admits that there is a threat of an ISIS attack in the United States. We looked at other White House statements from around that time and didn’t find anything else to back Scarborough up. Obama delivered a brief statement on Nov. 13 about the terrorist attack in Paris, but he did not address the possibility of terrorist attacks in the United States. At that time, ISIS’s involvement was unclear. In Nov. 15 remarks in Ankara, Turkey, Obama expressed solidarity with France and spoke about the fight against ISIS in the Middle East but did not discuss the potential for attacks in the United States. In a Nov. 16 press conference, also in Turkey, Obama delivered a similar message, but he also explicitly addressed "the possibility of terrorist attacks on our soil." "There are certain advantages that the United States has in preventing these kinds of attacks. Obviously, after 9/11, we hardened the homeland, set up a whole series of additional steps to protect aviation, to apply lessons learned. We’ve seen much better cooperation between the FBI, state governments, local governments. There is some advantages to geography with respect to the United States. "But, having said that, we’ve seen the possibility of terrorist attacks on our soil. There was the Boston Marathon bombers. Obviously, it did not result in the scale of death that we saw in Paris, but that was a serious attempt at killing a lot of people by two brothers and a crockpot. And it gives you some sense of, I think, the kinds of challenges that are going to be involved in this going forward." So in the weekend immediately following the Paris attacks, it doesn’t seem that any White House official dismissed the possibility of an ISIS attack on U.S. soil. Our ruling Scarborough said that in the weekend after the terrorist attacks in Paris, the White House said "this couldn't happen in the United States. ISIS couldn't reach us here." Obama and Rhodes, an adviser, both spoke of the Islamic State’s aspirations to attack the United States in the two or three days following the Paris attacks. They talked about what the government is doing to prevent the group from carrying out its plans. Neither ruled out the possibility that ISIS could stage an attack on U.S. soil, nor did any other White House official. We rate Scarborough’s claim False.

pomt-08219	Texas leads "the country in drunk driving fatalities."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/nov/18/art-acevedo/austin-police-chief-says-texas-leads-nation-drunk-/	Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo cut to the chase during an interview about a law that lets drivers convicted of driving while intoxicated return to the road. "We're in the worst state in the union when it comes to drunk driving and drunk driving fatalities," Acevedo said in an interview with the Austin American-Statesman and Austin's KVUE-TV, Channel 24. "We lead the country in drunk driving fatalities." The interview aired Sunday Nov. 14. Texas, No. 1 in alcohol-fueled driving deaths? We asked Acevedo how he reached his conclusion, then started checking national comparisons. An August 2010 report posted online appears to support the claim. In 2009, Texas tallied 1,235 alcohol-impaired fatalities, according to the report by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, which says the statistic reflects fatalities in crashes involving a driver or motorcycle rider with a blood alcohol concentration of .08 grams per deciliter or greater. The 2009 Texas total exceeded by more than 250 the 950 alcohol-related driving fatalities in California, which was the No. 2 state in the dubious category. States rounding out this top 10 were Florida (770), Pennsylvania (406), South Carolina (377), North Carolina (363), Georgia (331), Ohio (324), New York (321) and Illinois (319). Texas also topped other states in alcohol-impaired fatalities in 2008, the report says. The report also lays out the percentage of total traffic deaths due to alcohol impairment. Texas ranked No. 5 by this gauge, with alcohol impairment accounting for 40 percent of the 3,071 driving deaths in 2009. Four states had higher percentages: Hawaii, 48 percent of 109 deaths; Connecticut, 44 percent of 223 deaths; South Carolina, 42 percent of 894 deaths; and Washington, 42 percent of 492 deaths. Texas's 40 percent matched the percentages of deaths linked to alcohol impairment in South Dakota, Kansas and Rhode Island. Though Texas last year experienced one of the country's largest reductions in total traffic fatalities -- from 3,476 deaths in 2008 to 3,071 in 2009 -- more people still died on Texas roads than in any other state. As with drunk-driving deaths, that toll is influenced by factors such as Texas's size, population and number of miles traveled on its roads. In search of expert perspective on the meaning of such numbers, we reached Bernie Fette, a senior researcher at the Center for Transportation Safety at the Texas Transportation Institute in College Station. He showed us two other ways to compare alcohol-related driving deaths by state, based on the percentage of such deaths for every 100 million vehicle miles traveled or on the number of licensed drivers in each state. Online, NHTSA has posted state-by-state rates of alcohol-impaired driving fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled for 2005 through 2008. We checked the rates over those years for the 10 states that had the most alcohol-impaired driving fatalities in 2009--and found that Texas's rate per 100 million vehicle miles traveled, ranging from .55 in 2007 to a high of .59 in 2006, exceeded that of all but one of the states. South Carolina's rate, ranging from .81 in 2008 to .91 in 2007, was higher every year. The federal agency also provides information on the number of licensed drivers by state as of 2008. We divided the number of alcohol-impaired driving deaths in each state for that year by its licensed driver total. According to the resulting ratios, Texas ranked 9th nationally in alcohol-impaired driving deaths that year. States with higher ratios were topped by Wyoming, followed by Mississippi, South Carolina, Montana, Louisiana, Oklahoma, North Dakota and West Virginia. We also wondered how Texas compares in alcohol-related driving deaths when population is taken into account. We divided the 2009 alcohol-impaired driving deaths for each state by U.S. Census Bureau population estimates for each state. Result: Texas trailed 15 states in deaths per resident. States with higher ratios, led by Wyoming, included North Dakota, Montana, South Carolina, Mississippi, Louisiana, South Dakota, Oklahoma, West Virginia, Alabama, Arkansas, New Mexico, Kansas, Delaware and Missouri. So, it looks like Texas is not No. 1 for drunk driving deaths by every measure. Still, Fette suggested, no matter how you look at the stats on alcohol-impaired driving deaths in Texas, the news isn't good. "If all of the measures rank at the top or nearly at the top, no matter what the (state's) rank is, it's a serious problem that deserves attention," he said. Our take: Several statistical approaches show Texas behind other states in the rate of alcohol-related driving deaths. But it's also reasonable to focus on the sheer number of deaths linked to drunk driving. We rate Acevedo's statement Mostly True.

pomt-12927	"The same 3 senators who have spent the last 3 years s------- themselves over ‘Benghazi!’ just introduced a bill to reduce embassy security by 50 percent."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/12/other-98/meme-exaggerates-gop-senators-bill-embassy-move/	Are three Republican senators who once blasted lax embassy security in Benghazi, Libya, now playing Russian roulette with other embassies around the world? A meme making the social media rounds says so, and readers asked us to check it out. The image includes pictures of three Republican senators — Ted Cruz of Texas, Dean Heller of Nevada and Marco Rubio of Florida — along with the caption, "The same 3 senators who have spent the last 3 years s------- themselves over ‘Benghazi!’ just introduced a bill to reduce embassy security by 50 percent." We wanted to know if the meme was accurate about how these three senators responded to the Sept. 11, 2012, attack by Islamic extremists on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, and whether the lawmakers are indeed trying to roll back embassy security. Many Republicans used the attack to criticize Hillary Clinton, secretary of state at the time, for being insufficiently attentive to embassy security and thus being at least partially at fault for the deaths of four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens. How accurate is this assertion? Actually, it’s misleading on several points. (We were unable to reach the group that created the meme, the Other 98, a group that says it fights "economic injustice, undue corporate influence and threats to democracy.") On the first point, Cruz and Rubio have levied strong opinions about Benghazi and Clinton for years, but it’s a stretch to put Heller in the same category. To cite just one example, Cruz in June 2016 responded to the release of the final report of the House Select Committee on Benghazi by issuing a statement that called it "disturbing" that the "bureaucratic incompetence of the Department of State under Secretary Clinton contributed to the administration’s willful blindness, as the pleas for help from our foreign service officers in Libya were routinely ignored." Rubio, who like Cruz ran for president in 2016, also cast Benghazi as a shadow over Clinton’s record. For instance, during a GOP primary debate in October 2015, Rubio said that Clinton "got exposed as a liar" during her day-long testimony before the Benghazi committee. (The Washington Post Fact Checker gave this Two Pinocchios out of a maximum of four.) And Rubio released a statement that rapped Clinton for the "extraordinary failure" by State Department officials, including Clinton, "to grasp the security risks in Libya and Benghazi in particular, and take the appropriate action to protect Americans stationed in that country." Heller, however, has been much more circumspect about Benghazi. We found less rhetoric about Benghazi by Heller than by either Cruz or Rubio in our searches of Google, Lexis-Nexis and their respective Senate websites. For instance, Heller issued a statement calling for "thoughts and prayers" for the victims the day after the attacks took place, and another one two days later specifically memorializing one of the victims, Tyrone Woods, who was a Nevada resident. Those are the only two releases related to Benghazi on his Senate website. The only other examples linking Heller and Benghazi that came up in Nexis or Google searches occurred after the recent bill’s introduction. Meanwhile, the meme’s argument that the senators are hypocrites for wanting to cut embassy security by 50 percent is exaggerated. The bill at issue is S. 11, the Jerusalem Embassy and Recognition Act, which Cruz, Rubio and Heller laid out in a joint news release. The main focus of S. 11 is on moving the American embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem -- something that Congress mandated in 1995 when it passed the Jerusalem Embassy and Relocation Act. Presidents of both parties have declined to carry out the move, expressing concerns that doing so would complicate the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians. President-elect Donald Trump is seen as more supportive of an embassy move. The part about the 50-percent cut for embassy security isn’t made up. The bill says that if the embassy is not moved, then "not more than 50 percent of the amounts appropriated to the Department of State for fiscal year 2017 under the heading ‘Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance’ may be obligated until the Secretary of State determines and reports to Congress that the United States Embassy in Jerusalem has officially opened." The bill has not yet been taken up. So saying that the senators "introduced a bill to reduce embassy security by 50 percent" is misleading. The senators introduced a bill to move the embassy, using the specter of a budget cut as leverage to support that goal -- not as the goal itself. None of them affirmatively wants to cut embassy security funding, though they are willing to risk that outcome if their primary goal is not met. In the Jan. 3 news release announcing the bill, the three senators didn’t even mention the threat of a security cut, while repeatedly highlighting their goal of moving the embassy. In addition, Heller’s office told PolitiFact that a different State Department account than the one mentioned in the bill -- the Diplomatic and Consular Programs account -- is a "critical source" of funds for "high threat protection needs, security technology, armored vehicles, cyber security, and diplomatic couriers." And that account would not be touched by the threatened cuts. Finally, it’s worth noting that this is the fourth time Heller has introduced a bill along these lines -- S.1622, introduced on Sept, 23, 2011; S.604, introduced on March 19, 2013; S.117, introduced on Jan. 7, 2015; and the current bill. So one could just as easily view the bill’s introduction as the latest in a series of nearly identical bills that Heller has introduced like clockwork since 2011 -- almost a year before the Benghazi attacks took place. Our ruling A meme from the Other 98 said, "The same 3 senators who have spent the last 3 years s------- themselves over ‘Benghazi!’ just introduced a bill to reduce embassy security by 50 percent." The meme has a point — Cruz, Rubio and Heller did submit a bill that seeks to leverage the threat of a 50 percent cut to the State Department’s "Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance" account in the service of forcing the executive branch to move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. However, the meme goes too far in suggesting that the 50 percent cut was the purpose of the bill, and it ignores that some of the most important security funds would be untouched. The meme also ignores that essentially the same bill was introduced almost a year before the Benghazi attacks, and it incorrectly labels Heller as one of the more outspoken Republican lawmakers on Benghazi. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-14298	"Over 97 percent of the scientific community … believe that humans are contributing to climate change."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2016/apr/04/don-beyer/don-beyer-says-97-percent-scientists-believe-human/	It’s time to stop debating the science behind whether humans contribute to rising temperatures, says U.S. Rep. Don Beyer, D-8th. "Even while over 97 percent of the scientific community and the vast majority of Americans believe that humans are contributing to climate change, a small but well-heeled cohort continues to deny and even try to discredit what objective science tells us unambiguously," he wrote in a March 24 post on his congressional website. This Truth-O-Meter will focus on Beyer’s claim that 97 percent of the scientific community believes humans are a cause of climate change - a figure widely cited by those urging efforts to stem global warming. Climate change skeptics repeatedly have said the figure is not credible. We asked Beyer for the source of his statistic. His spokesman, Thomas Scanlon, pointed to several articles in scientific journals, information from NASA, and other sources about climate change. Let’s start with NASA. Here’s what its website says: "Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals show that 97 percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree: Climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities. In addition, most of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position." So the federal space agency notes that the 97 percent figure more narrowly focuses on "actively publishing climate scientists." That’s different from Beyer’s broad contention that 97 percent the entire "scientific community" thinks humans contribute to global warming. Still, this leaves us with the question: What are the sources for the 97 percent? NASA points to several of them in a footnote on its website. Cook study The first is a 2013 study by John Cook, a fellow at the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland in Australia. He and his co-authors examined 11,944 abstracts of climate science reports published from 1991 to 2011. Two-thirds of the abstracts didn’t express any opinion about whether man-made global warming was occurring. But among the roughly 4,000 studies that did, 97.1 percent of them "endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming," the report says. Cook also asked a sample of 1,200 authors of the climate reports to rate their own papers and say whether their research agreed that global warming was man-made. The result was that 97.2 percent of the papers that expressed an opinion about man-made global warming backed the position that it’s caused by human activity. Cook’s methodology has been criticized. Tol study Richard Tol, a professor with the Institute for Environmental Studies in Amsterdam, rejects the 97 percent figure. In a 2014 article, he said it was based on an unrepresentative sample of climate science papers that took into account only one-quarter of the climate research available. Tol had other misgivings about the Australian researcher’s methodology. In re-running the figures, Tol found that some 91 percent of climate research papers that Cook’s team examined supported the consensus that man is the main reason for the Earth’s warming temperatures. Despite taking aim at the specificity of the 97 percent figure, Tol said he agrees there indeed is a large consensus that warming temperatures are the result of human activity. "There is no doubt in my mind that the literature on climate change overwhelmingly supports the hypothesis that climate change is caused by humans," Tol wrote. "I have very little reason to doubt that the consensus is indeed correct. Cook et al., however, failed to demonstrate this." In a reply, Cook re-examined the data and stood by his paper’s conclusions in a 2014 post on his blog, Skeptical Science. University of Illinois study Beyond this debate, NASA also cites a January 2009 study by researchers at the University of Illinois. They surveyed 3,146 earth scientists and asked two questions: Was global warming occurring? Was human activity a "significant contributing factor" for changes in the Earth’s temperatures? Nine out of 10 of the scientists said the Earth’s temperatures had risen, and 82 percent said human activities were a key reason. Winnowing the field to climate change researchers who actively published their results, the survey found that 75 of 77 of them, or 97.4 percent, said human activity is a significant driver of climate change. That latter figure also has come under criticism because of its small sample size. National Academy of Sciences Another study published in 2010 by the National Academy of Sciences created a database of 908 climate researchers who had their work published at least 20 times in scientific journals. The study found roughly 90 percent of the climate researchers were convinced that rising temperatures are being caused by human activity, while 10 percent were not convinced. But the more expertise the researchers had, the greater their consensus. Looking at the top 200 researchers, based on the number of articles they published, just 2.5 percent of them were unconvinced climate change was mostly the result of human activity, the study found. That left "97–98% of the climate researchers most actively publishing in the field surveyed" convinced that rising temperatures were mostly due to humans, the report said. Conversely, the study found that the expertise of researchers who weren’t convinced of man-made global warming was "substantially below that of the convinced researchers." Bill Anderegg, the PNAS report’s lead author, told us in an email that "the quote from (Beyer) is absolutely consistent with the scientific literature on this." We also found a 2013 poll of roughly 1,800 meteorologists by the American Meteorological Society found that 73 percent of those surveyed felt that humans contributed to global warming. But for the more active publishing climate science experts within that group, 93 percent believed that humans were contributing to global warming. Our ruling Beyer said "over 97 percent of the scientific community" believe humans are contributing to climate change. The studies Beyer and others cite do not reflect the scientific community at large. They are surveys that focus on the conclusions of climatologists, earth scientists and meteorologists.

pomt-00081	Says Claire McCaskill "voted against including health records in the background check system."	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2018/nov/01/josh-hawley/hawley-claim-stretches-mccaskill-record-gun-backgr/	Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley told Missouri residents on live television that U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill voted against the inclusion of mental health records in gun background checks. "The (national background check system) doesn’t work that well because there’s a giant loophole right in the middle of it. It doesn’t include mental health records," Hawley said during the second Senate debate. "Congress could have done this, they’ve had the chance to do it, but they haven’t." "Sen. McCaskill voted against including health records in the background check system. I think that was wrong," Hawley said. "I know it was along the party line, but I think that was wrong." We’ve fact-checked other politicians’ statements on gun control legislation in the past, including some specifically related to firearm access for people with a history of mental illness. McCaskill has received an "F" rating from the National Rifle Association and taken $156,949 from gun control political action committees this election cycle, according to the nonprofit, nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. McCaskill maintained during the debate that she supports and has voted for universal background checks. So has she or hasn’t she voted against including mental health records as part of the gun-purchasing background check process? What McCaskill hasn’t voted for Hawley’s evidence for McCaskill’s disapproval of including mental health records in the background check system was her vote against a 2016 amendment to the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2016. Sponsored by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, the proposal was one of four that came in the wake of a mass shooting at an Orlando nightclub, where a gunman killed 49 people. Grassley’s 2016 amendment would have incentivized states to submit relevant mental health records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. "The Democrats put the kibosh on a bill that, on its face, would have strengthened (to some degree) populating NICS database with names of persons ineligible to purchase guns on account of a mental illness disqualifier," said Jacob James, a professor of constitutional law and director of the Center for Research in Crime and Justice at New York University, in an email. James said that Grassley’s amendment likely didn’t pass muster with Democrats like McCaskill "because they favored a stronger gun control bill, which had no chance of passage." Indeed, some of the leading opponents of the amendment said at the time that it did not go far enough in keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and suspected terrorists. "It was dangerous and reckless," said Jonas Oransky, legal director for Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control organization that rallied against the amendment. Oransky called it a decoy to meaningful gun control legislation that would have "invalidated hundreds of thousands of existing mental health records already in the background check system." Representatives from gun rights advocacy groups, including the National Rifle Association, which backed Grassley’s amendment, did not immediately respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment. The 2016 vote was similar to a failed 2013 measure co-sponsored by Grassley and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. McCaskill voted against that one, too. What McCaskill has voted for McCaskill voted in favor of an amendment to the Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013. Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., sponsored the piece, which would have expanded background checks to gun shows and internet sales, and allotted grants "to improve the automation and transmittal of mental health records and criminal history dispositions." It also would have created a commission of experts charged with studying mass violence, including the role of mental health issues. The Manchin-Toomey amendment died in a Senate filibuster. In 2016, as McCaskill voted no on the Grassley amendment, she voted yes on another amendment co-sponsored by Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., known as the Fix Gun Checks Act of 2016. Its purpose was to ensure that "all individuals who should be prohibited from buying a firearm are listed in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and require a background check for every firearm sale." Though it, too, failed to pass, the amendment also included guidelines on how to define and include relevant mental health records in the national background check system. "Sen. McCaskill has consistently and repeatedly supported legislation to improve the federal background check system," said Max Samis, press secretary for gun control Brady Campaign and Center to Prevent Gun Violence.* Samis along with McCaskill’s campaign noted McCaskill’s co-sponsorship of a bill called the Fix NICS ACT of 2017, which aims to incentivize states to submit relevant records to the nationwide criminal background check system. After a gunman murdered 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Florida, last February, McCaskill joined other members of Congress in saying that proposal was a start, she saw a need for gun legislation that went further. "It’s an important little step, but surely we can do more than the teeniest, tiniest steps right now," McCaskill told Politico earlier this year. Our ruling Hawley said McCaskill "voted against including (mental) health records in the background check system." Hawley is isolating one vote from a GOP proposal while ignoring McCaskill’s full record in the Senate. McCaskill clearly has supported efforts to tighten restrictions for who can purchase a firearm, including measures that clearly addressed the inclusion of mental health records in the gun background check system and more aggressive overall provisions for regulating gun sales.

pomt-07556	Says the Southwest Florida Water Management District has $850 million in reserves, enough money in savings to run without levying taxes for more than two years.	false	/florida/statements/2011/apr/01/jd-alexander/senate-budget-chief-criticizes-water-management-di/	Here's a new one: The Senate budget committee chairman says the water management district that includes the Tampa Bay area is so overflowing with money that it could run for two years without collecting a dollar more in taxes. Sen. J.D. Alexander, R-Lake Wales, is making the claim as part of his proposal to fold the Southwest Florida Water Management District budget -- along with the budgets of the four other water management districts -- into the general state budget. "When I see $850 million, half of which is not reserved for anything, and we've essentially allowed them to collect taxes on people when they really didn't need the money, I don't understand that," Alexander told reporters on March 29, 2011. On March 31, Alexander made a similar claim, telling members of the Senate budget committee that the Southwest Florida Water Management District has $850 million in "reserves." The talk about the water management district stuck out to several people, who asked us if it could be true. Specifically we wanted to know: Does the Southwest Florida Water Management District, or Swiftmud, have enough money to operate for more than two years without levying taxes? The state's five water management districts generally operate independently, but their governing boards are appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate, and the governor must approve water management district budgets each year. Alexander wants more control over district budgets to potentially lower the property taxes they collect, and to provide additional oversight of the taxing entities. Alexander's office began requesting detailed financial information from Swiftmud a few weeks ago, said David Rathke, the district's legislative affairs director. The water management district covers 16 counties surrounding the Tampa Bay area and operates with a budget of about $280 million. Of that, about $160 million comes from property taxes, and about $76 million was carried over from previous years' budgets. The rest of the budget, around $44 million, is comprised of local, state and federal funds. On top of that, the water management district has separate pots of money for different types of projects and for future planning, said Rathke, Swiftmud spokeswoman Robyn Felix and finance director Daryl Pokrana. • $298 million set aside to fulfill outstanding contracts. • $78 million allocated for specific projects where contracts have not yet been finalized. • $182 million reserved for future projects that have neither been identified nor approved. Adding in the yearly $280 million budget brings the total to $838 million, or approximately the $850 million Alexander is talking about. The problem with Alexander's claim is that most of the money is obligated to ongoing projects or part of the district's yearly budget. Or it will soon become obligated as part of contracts for projects. They're not reserves in the way most people would think about it. "A lot of these projects are multiyear projects," Pokrana said. The water management district may look like it has a lot of money, he said, in part because it has no debt and does not issue bonds to finance projects. Some of the money set aside is funding a pipeline project that would transfer reclaimed water from the city of Lakeland to the Tampa Electric Company so it could be used for the electric company's operations instead of drinking water, Felix said. Other funds are being allocated for a restoration project in Sawgrass Lake in Pinellas County and to create a wetland treatment system on Lake Hancock in Polk County. Alexander said Swiftmud could forgo property tax collections for more than two years -- which would mean giving up at least $320 million in tax revenues (the annual amount the district collects multiplied by two). But the math doesn't add up. The district could bottom out $182 million in long-term planning and project funding. And it could postpone or cancel anticipated contracts for projects, freeing up an additional $78 million. But that adds up to only $260 million. The rest of the money is either part of Swiftmud's annual budget or being used to fund current, ongoing contracts. Alexander was trying to make the point that Swiftmud's bank account needs pruning. The district does have $182 million stored away to be used for future projects. But Alexander has overstated the issue by saying the Southwest Florida Water Management District has enough money in savings to run without levying taxes for more than two years.

pomt-07860	"Massachusetts public schools teach kids as young as kindergartners about gay marriage."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/feb/10/national-organization-marriage/national-organization-marriage-says-massachusetts-/	In early January, just days after Lincoln Chafee replaced Donald Carcieri as governor of Rhode Island, advocates on both sides of the same-sex marriage debate ramped up their annual battle. This year, the fight is taking on new intensity because, while Carcieri vowed for eight years to veto any bill to legalize gay marriage, Chafee supports it. Recently, a leading opponent, the National Organization for Marriage, mailed brochures throughout the state that included the headline: "Imposing same-sex marriage has consequences." The brochure listed four "real consequences" of "redefining marriage to a genderless institution." We chose to examine one of the claims: "Massachusetts’ public schools teach kids as young as kindergartners about gay marriage. Parents have no legal right to object!" We contacted Christopher C. Plante, executive director of the Rhode Island chapter of NOM, who told us that many schools in Massachusetts -- where same-sex marriage has been legal since 2004 -- have books on the subject in their libraries.The "poster child," he said, is a picture book called "King & King," by Linda de Haan and Stern Nijland. The book tells the story of a queen who decided it was time for her son, the prince, to marry. He rejects every princess she offers. Finally the last candidate enters, and the prince feels "a stir in his heart." But it was for the princess’s brother, Prince Lee. The two marry, and the book says "everyone lives happily ever after." On the last page, the two princes kiss, with a red heart covering their mouths. The book "glorifies the idea that it’s perfectly OK to have same-sex marriage," said Plante. And he said the courts have ruled that the educational system has a duty to "normalize" same-sex marriage for grades as low as kindergarten. Asked for examples of where the book is taught to kindergartners, Plante offered just one location, Lexington, Mass., where it became an issue in 2006. That year, two couples -- David and Tonia Parker and Robert and Robin Wirthlin -- filed a federal lawsuit against Lexington school officials. The suit alleged that the Parkers’ son was given a book in kindergarten that depicts various forms of families, including one with parents of the same gender. And, the suit said, when the Wirthlins’ son was in first grade, he was read another book, "King & King," in school. The parents said they have religious beliefs that homosexuality is immoral and that marriage is a holy union only of a man and a woman. They alleged school officials were attempting to indoctrinate their children with the belief that same sex marriages are moral. In 2007, The U.S. District Court in Massachusetts dismissed the parents’ claims, finding that parents don’t have the right to restrict what a public school may teach their children, even if the teachings contradict the parents’ religious beliefs. The parents appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit but lost. The appeals court wrote: "There is no allegation here of a formalized curriculum requiring students to read many books affirming gay marriage. The reading by a teacher of one book, or even three, and even if to a young and impressionable child, does not constitute "indoctrination." Asked for any other examples of gay marriage being taught to kindergartners, Plante referred us to Kris Mineau, executive director of the Massachusetts Family Institute, which describes itself as "dedicated to strengthening the family and affirming the Judeo-Christian values upon which it is based." Mineau said he has been fighting same-sex marriage advocates for eight years and he is certain their message is being spread in schools throughout Massachusetts. But he acknowledged he could not cite any examples other than Lexington. "I don’t have documentation of everything going on," Mineau said. "It’s very difficult to quantify." Mineau also said the 2007 court rulings discouraged other parents from officially complaining about their children being exposed to school programs endorsing same-sex marriage. We looked for other evidence that Massachusetts schools are teaching kindergartners about same-sex marriage. We asked Jonathan Considine, spokesman for the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, if the state mandated curriculum on same-sex marriage for kindergartners. The answer is no, he said. Massachusetts is a local control state, so each district decides on what topics to cover. He said, "Massachusetts does not require that students in any grade be taught about gay marriage." He said many schools have used books or promoted discussions to teach tolerance because some students have same-sex parents and there are teachers with same-sex spouses. Considine referred us to The Massachusetts Comprehensive Health Curriculum, which includes a standard that by fifth grade, students should be able to define sexual orientation, such as heterosexual, gay and lesbian. It makes no recommendations about teaching different types of marriages to kindergartners. Then we called the Massachusetts Teachers Association, which represents 107,000 educators. Laura Bennett, a spokeswoman for the association, said she does not know whether anyone is discussing same-sex marriages with kindergartners in any of the state’s hundreds of school districts. But she is relatively certain no one else has publicly complained. "I work on communications with teachers, and if there were other cases, I would have heard," she said. "There’s just that one case, over and over again." "I haven’t heard boo about this," added Thomas Gosnell, president of the American Federation of Teachers Massachusetts, which represents most of the other educators in the state. "I have not heard one of my members tell me they are talking about gay marriage in kindergarten. They are probably not talking about any kind of marriage in that grade. "I don’t even hear anyone talking about gay marriage anymore," he added. "It’s just there." Bottom line: The National Organization for Marriage mailing says that Massachusetts public schools teach kindergartners about gay marriage. The wording, including the present tense verb, gives the impression this is happening now, in many schools. But the group’s only evidence is two incidents five years ago. It’s possible that somewhere, in one of the 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts, other kindergartners have been taught about same-sex marriage. But NOM couldn’t cite any other examples. We find its statement False.	None	National Organization for Marriage	None	None	None	2011-02-10T00:00:01	2011-02-05	['None']
pomt-11872	Says HIV and AIDS rates have spiked "due to increased heroin and fentanyl use."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/31/edward-markey/sen-ed-markey-says-hivaids-have-spiked-due-fentany/	Democratic Sen. Edward J. Markey said that the Trump administration’s plan to use funds from HIV and AIDS programs to fight the opioid addiction crisis is unsound. Specifically, the Massachusetts senator said that increased opioid abuse has led to an increase in HIV and AIDS. The administration’s Oct. 26 declaration of the opioid epidemic as a national public health emergency allows flexibility in the use of resources in HIV and AIDS programs to allow people eligible for those programs to get substance abuse treatment. "The administration’s proposal to reallocate funding from HIV/AIDS programs to the opioid crisis is robbing Peter to pay Paul, especially as HIV and AIDS rates spike due to increased heroin and fentanyl use," Markey said in an Oct. 26 statement. We wanted to know if increased use of heroin and fentanyl have led to increased rates of HIV and AIDS. We found some truth to Markey’s claim but not enough national data to fully back it. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told us it does not have data specific to heroin and fentanyl, and estimates that HIV and AIDs diagnoses have declined in recent years among people who inject drugs. Still, there are risks associated with opioid injections and HIV transmissions, as was the case in an Indiana county. U.S. opioid epidemic, transmitted diseases More than 64,000 people died in 2016 from drug overdoses, the majority linked to opioids, which include the synthetic opioid fentanyl and the illicit drug heroin, according to the CDC. Increased availability, a relatively low price and the high purity of heroin in the United States are driving increased use of heroin, the CDC said. Fentanyl use, including illicitly-made fentanyl, has also increased in recent years. People who inject drugs are at risk for infectious diseases that can be transmitted through used needles and syringes. Human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, is most commonly acquired or transmitted through sexual behaviors and needle or syringe use. If not treated, HIV can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS. The CDC’s HIV Surveillance Report, 2015, noted that HIV and AIDS diagnoses tied to injection drug use declined from 2010 to 2015. The report did not specify diagnoses by types of drugs injected. From 2008 to 2014, estimated annual HIV infections among people who inject drugs declined 56 percent (from 3,900 to 1,700), according to February 2017 data from the CDC. That report did not include AIDS data. HIV outbreak in southeastern Indiana Experts we reached said they were not aware of reports showing a national spike in HIV and AIDS among injection drug users, but noted that data collection and reporting tends to lag. "It is very possible that increased HIV transmission due to fentanyl and/or heroin use is occurring" but have not yet been identified through HIV testing and screening or have not yet been reported to CDC, said Brandon Marshall, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Brown University School of Public Health. When we contacted Markey’s office, they highlighted reports about HIV spikes in Scott County. Scott County historically had fewer than five cases of HIV infection reported annually, CDC reported. By April 21, 2015, Indiana officials had diagnosed HIV in 135 people in a small community within Scott County. Most of them reported injection drug use with oxymorphone as their drug of choice, said CDC’s May 2015 report, adding that some reported injecting heroin. Since early 2015, at least 191 people had tested positive for HIV in Scott County, the Indiana State Department of Health said in April 2016. "The outbreak in Scott County turned a floodlight on the intertwined nature of opioid use, HIV, and (hepatitis C virus) … It’s possible that the opioid epidemic could already be having a similar impact in other communities," said a June blog post by Richard Wolitski, director of the office of HIV/AIDS and Infectious Disease Policy at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. A CDC analysis published November 2016 found that at least 220 counties in 26 states are "potentially vulnerable" to HIV and hepatitis C infections among persons who inject drugs "in the context of the national opioid epidemic." Our ruling Markey said, HIV and AIDS rates have spiked "due to increased heroin and fentanyl use." There are risks for HIV transmission among people who share needles and syringes to inject opioids. An Indiana county recently had an HIV outbreak linked to the injection of opioids, including heroin. At least 220 U.S. counties may be at risk of similar outbreaks. But the CDC said it does not have national data addressing Markey’s heroin and fentanyl claim, and estimates that HIV and AIDs diagnoses have declined in recent years among people who inject drugs. Markey’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-07398	Rep. Paul Ryan’s Medicare plan "lines the pockets of the private insurance companies," increases costs for seniors and does not reduce the deficit.	half-true	/virginia/statements/2011/apr/30/gerry-connolly/gerry-connolly-says-gop-medicare-plan-would-line-p/	Rep. Paul Ryan’s recent proposal to overhaul Medicare opened a round of partisan debate over how to control the costs of popular entitlement programs that are driving the U.S. deep into debt. The plan, part of the House GOP’s 2012 budget, passed the chamber with no Democratic support. Although it is certain to die in the Senate or on Obama’s desk, Ryan’s effort to reduce the government’s role in providing health insurance to seniors is likely to remain an issue in the 2012 elections. Ryan, R-Wis., is chairman of the House Budget Committee. Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Democrat from Fairfax County, recently assailed Ryan’s plan to privatize much of Medicare. Under the proposal, seniors would buy private insurance policies and Uncle Sam would make a fixed payment to insurers to help cover the plans. The system would start in 2022 for everyone who is 65 or younger that year. "Not one dollar of the increased costs to seniors would be used to reduce the deficit," Connolly said in a press release. "Instead, the Republican plan lines the pockets of the private insurance companies." Are Connolly’s comments true? George Burke, Connolly’s communications director, said the claim was based on projections from the Congressional Budget Office that Ryan’s plan would require seniors to pay more for health coverage but not really reduce government expenses. He said the plan "lines the pockets" of insurers because seniors would have to buy private insurance, something they don’t have to do now. First, let’s discuss how Ryan’s plan would work. Under the legislation, people who turn 65 after 2022 would get a "premium support payment" from Medicare, paid directly to an insurer they select towards the cost of buying private health insurance. The payment is projected to be about $8,000 in 2022 for someone turning 65 that year. As people grow older, the subsidy would increase. That’s because health care costs increase with age. Ryan’s plan would raise the baseline payment each year by the increase in the Consumer Price Index. That would allow the payment to keep up with overall inflation, although medical costs have been climbing much faster than total inflation. One result, the CBO said, would be that future Medicare recipients "would pay more for their health care than they would pay under the current Medicare system." Let’s go back to Connolly now. We’ll start by addressing the second part of his claim, that requiring seniors to buy private health insurance would "line the pockets" of private insurers. Although Connolly’s language might be dramatic, he’s right about the basic detail. If Americans over 65 start buying private insurance, with their own money or with government funds, total premium levels will climb for private health insurers. And because the largest health insurance companies are publicly traded and seek profits, it is a good bet that they won’t offer money-losing Medicare plans. The insurers would have to meet standards set by the federal government, however. They would have to charge the same premium to everyone who is the same age, and could not deny coverage to seniors based on pre-existing health conditions. The Ryan plan would provide higher insurance subsidies to low-income people; those in the top 8 percent of earnings would receive smaller government payments. So Connolly’s right on part of his claim. The Ryan plan would increase revenues from premiums revenues at private insurers. We won’t pass judgment on whether this is "lining the pockets" of these companies, since there is little chance of predicting what profit margins would be like under these plans in 10 years. Now let’s examine Connolly’s claim that "not one dollar of the increased costs to seniors would be used to reduce the deficit." As we mentioned, the CBO believes that seniors would pay more from their own pockets for health care under Ryan’s plan. So the increased costs to seniors makes sense. But as Joe Antos, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute points out, if seniors have to pay more, government should end up paying less. The CBO estimates that health costs would be higher under the Ryan plan than under traditional Medicare for a 65-year-old in 2022. The reason for the increase, it says, is that "both administrative costs (including profits) and payment rates to providers are higher for private plans than for Medicare." Antos and Marc Goldwein, an economist at the non-partisan New America Foundation, said the government’s premium payments under the Ryan plan would grow more slowly than Medicare’s expenses under the current set-up. So while there may be little savings initially, over time the government’s share of Medicare spending would fall. Those savings would be available for other programs, including deficit reduction. Antos also said the payments would encourage health insurers and providers to economize because seniors would not have blank checks to pay for tests and treatments. Health-care insurers and providers would have incentive to "increase profits through more efficient care, delivered in a more efficient manner." Paul Van de Water at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities used the CBO information and his own calculations to estimate the cost difference between Ryan’s plan and the current system. Under the current system, Van de Water says a typical 65-year-old pays $6,150 for premiums and out-of-pocket costs on Medicare and supplemental coverage. The government pays about $8,600. In 2022, he said, a 65-year-old would see out-of-pocket costs double to $12,500, while the government’s share of costs would fall by $600, to $8,000. So while the government would see some savings, Ryan’s plan "increases the total health costs for beneficiaries by vastly more than it reduces the federal government’s spending," Van de Water said. Dean Baker, another left-leaning economist, said the plan could save the government money over time, but only at the cost of much higher payments from seniors. He, like Van de Water and the CBO, said using private insurers will mean higher costs and more inefficiencies. Those inefficiencies cost money. Let’s review: The liberal economists don’t like Ryan’s plan and say it would harm seniors, but they concede it would lead to lower government spending on health care costs, at least over time. That contradicts Connolly’s assertion that no money from these increased costs would help pay down the deficit. It’s true that the new payments by seniors would go towards private insurers, but savings from lower government spending could go towards deficit reductions. We rate Connolly’s claim Half True.

pomt-11565	Says the Steele dossier "was—according to (James Comey's) June 2017 testimony—'salacious and unverified.' "	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/feb/05/devin-nunes/nunes-memo-twists-james-comeys-words-steele-dossie/	The memo assembled by aides to House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., has spawned lots of debate, both before it was released on Feb. 2 and afterward. One small portion of the memo, however, has attracted special scrutiny from experts and pundits: how former FBI Director James Comey characterized the "Steele Dossier" under oath to Congress. The memo suggests that Comey had said the Steele dossier was bunk in its entirety. But that’s not what Comey said. The dossier in question was compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele on behalf of Fusion GPS, a research firm whose work had been funded in part by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. It describes some of Donald Trump’s trips to Russia, before he became president, describing who he interacted with and things he did there. The Nunes memo recounts the history of the dossier leading up to Trump taking office before concluding, "in early January 2017, Director Comey briefed President-elect Trump on a summary of the Steele dossier, even though it was—according to his June 2017 testimony—'salacious and unverified.' " What we’re looking at in this fact-check is whether Comey actually said that the Steele dossier was "salacious and unverified." The Nunes memo is effectively leveraging Comey’s credibility -- as someone who was fired by President Donald Trump, thus not a strong supporter of the president -- to undercut the dossier. The House Intelligence Committee did not respond to an inquiry for this article. What we found in the public record suggests a more limited assertion under oath by Comey -- that he’d said portions of the memo were "salacious and unverified," not the whole thing. (We owe a debt in this fact-check to writings by two conservative blogs, RedState and HotAir.) We found a few relevant portions of Comey’s testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee on June 8, 2017. One came from his prepared testimony: "I first met then-President-Elect Trump on Friday, January 6 in a conference room at Trump Tower in New York. I was there with other Intelligence Community (IC) leaders to brief him and his new national security team on the findings of an IC assessment concerning Russian efforts to interfere in the election. At the conclusion of that briefing, I remained alone with the President-Elect to brief him on some personally sensitive aspects of the information assembled during the assessment. "The IC leadership thought it important, for a variety of reasons, to alert the incoming President to the existence of this material, even though it was salacious and unverified. Among those reasons were: (1) we knew the media was about to publicly report the material and we believed the IC should not keep knowledge of the material and its imminent release from the President-Elect; and (2) to the extent there was some effort to compromise an incoming President, we could blunt any such effort with a defensive briefing." In this passage, Comey seems to apply the terms "salacious and unverified" to "this material," which in turn refers to the earlier reference to "some personally sensitive aspects of the information assembled during the assessment." At the very least, this passage doesn’t suggest it’s a slam dunk that the entire dossier is "salacious and unverified." It refers to "some potentially sensitive aspects" of the dossier. One instance in which Comey repeated the phrase "salacious and unverified" came during an exchange with Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine: Collins: "I want first to ask you about your conversations with the president, three conversations in which you told him that he was not under investigation. The first was during your January 6th meeting, according to your testimony, in which it appears that you actually volunteered that assurance. ... Did you limit that statement to counterintelligence investigations, or were you talking about any FBI investigation?" Comey: "I didn't use the term counterintelligence. I was briefing him about salacious and unverified material. It was in a context of that that he had a strong and defensive reaction about that not being true." Comey’s language here ("material") is more opaque, but we don’t see any clear indication that he’s talking about the whole dossier as being "salacious and unverified." A third excerpt came in a remark to Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., when Comey referred to "unverified and salacious parts" of the dossier. Note Comey’s use of word "parts," rather than the whole dossier. A final relevant passage came during an exchange with the committee’s chairman, Richard Burr, R-N.C. Burr: "At the time of your departure from the FBI, was the FBI able to confirm any criminal allegations contained in the Steele document?" Comey: "Mr. Chairman, I don't think that's a question I can answer in an open setting because it goes into the details of the investigation." If the dossier in its entirety were total bunk, there would have been no need for Comey to suggest meeting Burr in a closed session. The fact that Comey suggests meeting in a place where intelligence can be discussed is an indication that the dossier included at least some sensitive information. We asked several experts whether they thought the memo had overplayed its hand about what Comey had said, and they largely agreed. "I took Comey’s testimony to be saying that there was ‘salacious and unverified material’ in the Steele dossier, but he does not claim that the entire dossier is salacious and unverified," said Molly Bishop Shadel, a University of Virginia law professor and former U.S. Justice Department attorney who practiced before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. "Could there be a world in which the entire dossier is salacious and unverified? Yes. Is that what Mr. Comey said in his testimony? No. By being inexact in his language, Mr. Nunes has misrepresented Mr. Comey’s testimony." Michael C.H. McDaniel, director of homeland security law programs at Western Michigan University’s Thomas M. Cooley Law School, said Comey’s carefully phrased words make the Nunes memo’s interpretation dubious. "I fully believe that Comey was referring to some of the facts in one of the memos that comprise the Steele dossier as being yet unverified, just as only portions appeared salacious," McDaniel said. "Any other interpretation is convoluted and illogical." Liza Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center’s National Security Program at New York University Law School, agreed. "Comey’s testimony does not clearly indicate that the entire dossier was salacious and unverified," she said. "It seems quite possible he was referring merely to particular parts of the dossier that would have especially raised Trump’s hackles, leading Comey to offer the assurance that Trump wasn’t under investigation." Our ruling The Nunes memo said the Steele dossier "was—according to (Comey's) June 2017 testimony—'salacious and unverified.' " Comey's careful phrasings in four portions of his testimony indicate that he meant only that portions of it were "salacious and unverified." The memo twists Comey’s words in an effort to leverage his stature to undercut the dossier. We rate the memo’s characterization of Comey’s past statements Half True.

pomt-12770	Says Michelle Obama "said she was never proud of her country til they elected her husband POTUS."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/feb/23/david-clarke-jr/david-clarke-says-michelle-obama-said-she-was-prou/	Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr., a big enough supporter of President Donald Trump that he has been mentioned for a role in the administration, has been a frequent basher of former President Barack Obama. On Feb. 17, 2017, he turned to attacking the former first lady. "Michelle Obama said she was never proud of her country til they elected her husband POTUS," Clarke charged on Twitter: "I've never been prouder since we got rid of him." With the tweet was a photo of Clarke, who is being encouraged by some to run against U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., in 2018. Flexing his biceps, Clarke is shown wearing a T-shirt with an image of Trump standing on a tank and holding a rifle. During Obama’s first presidential campaign, Obama did take some flack for remarks she made in Wisconsin about being proud of her country. Let’s see whether Clarke is accurately describing what she said. Two Wisconsin speeches Obama campaigned for her husband in Milwaukee and Madison on Feb. 18, 2008, the day before Wisconsin’s primary. He had won eight consecutive Democratic primaries and caucuses over Hillary Clinton. In Milwaukee, Michelle Obama said: People in this country are ready for change and hungry for a different kind of politics and … for the first time in my adult life I am proud of my country because it feels like hope is finally making a comeback. But remarks she made later in Madison were the ones that gained widespread media attention. Several minutes into her speech, Obama noted her husband’s primary victory in South Carolina and continued by saying: And then he went on to win throughout the country. And when’s the last time we’ve seen a candidate -- male, female, whatever party -- who has been able to pull together victories that included Utah and Idaho and Louisiana and Maine and Washington and Illinois. I don’t think we’ve seen that. But what we’ve learned over this year is that hope is making a comeback. It is making a comeback and let me tell you something: For the first time in my adult lifetime, I’m really proud of my country and not just because Barack has done well, but because I think people are hungry for change. And I have been desperate to see our country moving in that direction and just not feeling so alone in my frustration and disappointment. I’ve seen people who are hungry to be unified around some basic common issues and it’s made me proud. So, Obama’s remark was made before her husband had won the Democratic nomination and nine months before was elected president. And Obama said she was proud because Americans were hungry for change, not just because her husband was winning. But her statement was controversial. Asked the day after the Wisconsin primary, which her husband won, if she wanted to clarify her remarks, Obama said: What I was clearly talking about was that I'm proud in how Americans are engaging in the political process. For the first time in my lifetime, I'm seeing people rolling up their sleeves in a way that I haven't seen and really trying to figure this out -- and that's the source of pride that I was talking about. Bill Kristol, editor-at-large of the conservative Weekly Standard magazine, said at the time that Obama’s original comment "was sort of revealing," adding: She was an adult when we won the Cold War without firing a shot. She was an adult for the last 25 years of economic progress, social progress ….I don’t think the American people think on the whole that the last 25 years of American history is a narrative of despair and nothing to be proud of. CNN included the key part of Obama’s remark -- "For the first time in my adult lifetime, I'm really proud of my country, and not just because Barack has done well, but because I think people are hungry for change" -- in a documentary on her that aired in January 2017. That clip was followed by David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Obama, saying: Those kinds of moments gave you a heartburn. By the same token, it became clear to me very quickly that we had failed her, because we threw her out there without adequate staffing, without adequate preparation. For his part, Clarke didn’t provide us any information to back his claim. The sheriff’s office spokeswoman told us the sheriff said: "Go suck an egg" and that when he does provide us evidence of his claims, PolitiFact Wisconsin "still finds a way to contort a way to say false." Our rating Clarke says Obama "said she was never proud of her country til they elected her husband POTUS." He provided us and we could find no evidence of such a statement. What Obama said -- nine months before her husband was elected president -- was that for the first time in her adult life, she was proud of her country not just because Barack Obama had done well in pursuing the presidential nomination, but also "because I think people are hungry for change."

pomt-10513	McCain and Bush are millionaires who are "for tax cuts for millionaires."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/17/campaign-defend-america/both-millionaires-mccain-supports-bushs-cuts/	An ad goes after Sen. John McCain for being just like President George W. Bush, hitting McCain on Iraq, oil companies and health care. It also criticizes him on tax policy. "A millionaire who's for tax cuts for millionaires. McSame as Bush," the ad states. It's true that Bush and McCain are both millionaires, with McCain being somewhat wealthier. Bush's net worth in 2006 was between $7.6-million and $20.1-million, based on his personal financial disclosures required by law and analyzed by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. McCain, meanwhile, is worth somewhere between $27.8-million and $45-million. (Sen. Hillary Clinton's net worth is between $10.4-million and $51-million, while Sen. Barack Obama's is between $456,012 and $1.1-million.) So McCain and Bush are both millionaires, and that part of the statement is correct. We couldn't find any proposals John McCain supports that offer new tax cuts for millionaires, so we suspect this is a reference to McCain's support of the Bush tax cuts. Bush's tax cuts lowered rates across the board for those who pay federal income taxes, so they benefited both millionaire and nonmillionaire taxpayers. But data compiled from the Congressional Budget Office indicate that millionaires saw the most sizable drops to their tax rates measured as a share of income. Those tax cuts will expire during the next presidential administration unless Congress acts to keep them in place. McCain actually opposed the Bush tax cuts before changing his mind and supporting them now. He said the reason for his change of heart is that rescinding the tax cuts would be the equivalent of a tax increase after they had been in effect for so long. (Both Obama and Clinton want to roll back the Bush tax cuts for higher incomes.) If you're trying to identify the candidate who supports the Bush tax cuts, McCain is your man. But we're concerned that the ad leaves the impression that McCain advocates new, additional tax cuts for millionaires rather than keeping the present situation in place. For that reason, we knock this claim down one peg on the Truth-O-Meter and find it Mostly True.

pomt-00621	Austin school district "teachers are the lowest paid of any urban" Texas district and the "lowest paid of any surrounding school district."	half-true	/texas/statements/2015/may/27/gina-hinojosa/gina-hinojosa-says-austin-teachers-lowest-paid-any/	In May 2015, the president of Austin’s school board urged state lawmakers to put billions of additional dollars into school aid. The money should flow to teacher pay, Gina Hinojosa said, adding that teachers in the Austin district have lower salaries than peers elsewhere. Specifically, Hinojosa told Austin American-Statesman reporter Kiah Collier: "Currently our teachers are the lowest paid of any urban, lowest paid of any surrounding school district and we believe that's unacceptable." The lowest among whom? "Amongst all urban districts in the state and amongst surrounding Central Texas school districts," Hinojosa said. Is all of that so? To our inquiry, Hinojosa said she drew on information gathered by the district. District spokesman Reyne Telles then said by email the comparisons appeared in charts (see them here) showing the salaries of teachers with bachelor’s degrees at different years of experience drawn from information posted online by districts. Telles said the district is "confident in the numbers," which were part of a January 2015 staff presentation to the board. Left out of the comparison: Some 1,675 local teachers with master’s or doctoral degrees who, a district chart indicates, accounted for 29 percent of the district’s 5,842 teachers in 2014-15. By email, a district official, Michael Houser, said the teachers with advanced degrees earned $862 more than other Austin teachers. He said he believes that stipend trailed comparable payments made by the district’s Texas competitors. At any rate, the presentation that Hinojosa relied on shows some Austin teachers making more than Austin-area peers in 2014-15. But the bulk, more than six in 10 by our calculation, had salaries less than what was paid teachers nearby and in selected urban districts around the state. Houser told us by phone the district did not compare salaries in all urban districts, focusing instead on those other districts where it’s had recruiting success. Similarly, Houser said, the district did not check salaries in every nearby district, focusing on "our most immediate competition." The district’s charts show: --In 2014-15, Austin teachers with five through 30 years of experience were paid less than nearby peers in nearly every instance. Also, those teachers made less than nearly all peers in eight selected urban Texas districts: Cypress-Fairbanks (Harris County), Dallas, El Paso, Fort Bend, Fort Worth, Houston, Northside (Bexar County) and San Antonio. Austin teachers trailed the average pay for teachers in the other districts by $4,422 (for teachers with no experience) to $7,687 (teacher with 10 years’ experience). --In contrast, beginning and very experienced Austin teachers mostly drew more in pay than peers in the nine nearby districts: Del Valle, Eanes, Hays, Lake Travis, Leander, Manor, Pflugerville, Round Rock and San Marcos. That is, Austin teachers with no experience were paid $44,046, which exceeded the salary of comparable teachers in each of the nearby districts by a minimum of $546 up to $2,046. The nearby districts paid teachers with no experience an average of $42,810. --Austin teachers with 35 years of experience earned $3,595 to $6,104 more than teachers in four of the nearby districts though up to $3,605 less than comparable teachers in the five other Austin-area districts. Austin’s $56,595 salary for such teachers ran $1,406 ahead of the average $58,189 pay for such teachers in the nearby districts. Social Security A wrinkle: The district’s charts did not account for money it pays toward Social Security benefits for employees. By phone, Houser told us that’s because what once seemed a recruiting advantage—the district making contributions for Social Security and for pensions through the Teacher Retirement System of Texas—has become an albatross; teachers, Houser said, would prefer to get the district’s Social Security contributions in take-home pay. District spokesman Jacob Barrett said the Austin district is among 47 statewide that long ago committed to backing both benefits. Houser said that if Social Security contributions are folded into the comparisons, Austin’s teachers received more in compensation in 2014-15 than peers in the nearby districts. But Austin’s teachers still saw less compensation than counterparts in the urban districts the district considers peers, he said. We checked this by counting as income the district’s Social Security contributions, 6.2 percent of each employee’s gross pay. After these adjustments, Austin’s teacher salaries at every experience level exceeded the average for the nine nearby districts, with the Austin advantage ranging from $324 a year (for teachers with 25 years’ experience) to $5,101 (teachers with 35 years’ experience). But, as Houser said, counting the contributions as income did not propel Austin’s teachers at any experience level to higher pay than the average salaries of peers in the urban districts Austin uses for comparisons. An unknown: Whether Austin teachers will uniformly participate in Social Security long enough to reap full benefits on retirement. Health insurance We also asked if the Austin district compared health insurance benefits by district. By email, Houser pointed out a chart in the board presentation indicating Austin’s payments of $446.25 a month to cover employee health insurance premiums in 2014-15 were more than what nearly every nearby peer district spent; the Lake Travis district expended $537 a worker. The Austin district’s spending also outpaced expenditures for premiums in most of the urban districts selected as peers; the Houston district was paying $500. Austin generally pays more, Houser indicated, to fund a health plan offering more benefits than, say, the TRS-backed plan for which districts in 2014-15 were paying $325 monthly for employee premiums. Other pay analyses Other pay analyses bore out what we saw in the Austin district’s information. For instance, we asked the Texas Education Agency for its best data on teacher salaries within each district; spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe guided us to an agency website where we punched in district names to reach average base salaries for teachers in 2014-15 (not counting Social Security contributions). By this gauge, the Austin district’s average base teacher salary of $47,476 trailed average base teacher salaries in all but one of the nine nearby districts; the Manor district’s average base teacher salary was $46,093. Our searches indicated Austin’s average base teacher salary was less than the average base teacher salary in a dozen other urban districts. We looked at the Arlington, North East (Bexar County), Socorro and Ysleta districts in addition to the urban districts shown in the Austin district’s charts. TEA considers these added districts, like the Austin district and others, to be "major urban" districts. A district falls into this category if it’s located in a county with a population of at least 840,000; its enrollment is the largest in the county or at least 75 percent of the largest district enrollment in the county; and at least 35 percent of enrolled students are economically disadvantaged. For another take, we turned to the Texas Association of School Boards, which annually surveys districts on salaries. Spokesman Dax Gonzalez emailed us its findings for 2014-15--and the results, also not folding in Social Security contributions, aligned with the Austin district’s charts in that the least experienced and most experienced Austin teachers had higher salaries than peers in nearby districts--but other teachers trailed. Compared to teachers in the major urban districts that the TEA groups with the Austin district, Austin teachers had lower salaries at all experience levels. In the end, Hinojosa didn’t dispute the range of our findings. Still, she said, "we have a real problem in this district paying our employees enough." Our ruling Hinojosa said Austin school district "teachers are the lowest paid of any urban" Texas district and the "lowest paid of any surrounding school district." Hinojosa relied on research not extending to all urban or all nearby districts nor did it roll in teachers with advanced degrees. Those gaps aside, the pay contrasts aren’t entirely clear-cut. Inexperienced and very experienced Austin teachers were paid more in 2014-15 than peers in some or most nearby districts and if you count Social Security contributions, Austin teachers in general were compensated better on average than teachers in nearby districts. On the other hand, all Austin district teachers were paid less than counterparts in comparable urban districts across the state--even after taking into account Social Security contributions. On balance, we rate this claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-09932	Under a public health care option, 120 million Americans will "lose what they now get from private companies and be forced onto the government-run rolls as businesses decide it is more cost-effective for them to drop coverage."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/12/karl-rove/roves-op-ed-distorts-health-study/	Republican strategist Karl Rove argued against the Democrats' blueprint for health care, citing a Lewin Group study about what might happen under a public option for health care. The public option has become shorthand for the government offering an insurance plan to compete with private insurers. Advocates for the public option said it would be an insurer of last resort, such as for people who lose their health insurance when they lose their job. In a column in the Wall Street Journal, Rove said the public option would lead to America "becoming a European-style welfare state." "The Lewin Group estimates 70 percent of people with private insurance — 120 million Americans — will quickly lose what they now get from private companies and be forced onto the government-run rolls as businesses decide it is more cost-effective for them to drop coverage," Rove wrote. "They'd be happy to shift some of the expense — and all of the administration headaches — to Washington. And once the private insurance market has been dismantled it will be gone." The public option "is just phony," Rove wrote. "It's a bait-and-switch tactic meant to reassure people that the president's goals are less radical than they are. Mr. Obama's real aim, as some candid Democrats admit, is a single-payer, government-run health-care system." We'll note that President Barack Obama has said that is not his aim. But we were more interested in Rove's description of the study. The Lewin Group report, which we've looked at before, ran a number of different scenarios on what would happen if the government offered a public option. One scenario was a Medicare-style plan that was open to everyone. Under that type of public option, the government would pay health providers much less than private insurers and offer lower premiums to the public. The study model found that 118 million people would choose to drop their private coverage in favor of cheaper public coverage. (We'll note here that the Lewin Group is respected by many health care analysts and operates with editorial independence, but it is a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, which also offers private health insurance.) But Rove misrepresents the report in a couple of significant ways. First, he neglects to mention that the 120 million number is only for the public option that is most like Medicare, and if everyone were allowed to enroll. That is the most extreme option that could drive the most people from private insurers. But there are other ways to set up a public option health care plan. Under the Lewin Group's estimates, if you restrict a Medicare-style public option only to individuals and small businesses, only 32 million would leave private coverage. And if the public option is less like Medicare and competes more like a private insurer, the number drops further. What a public option might actually look like is one of the biggest questions Congress is grappling with right now. A group of fiscally conservative Democrats known as the Blue Dogs have said they do not support a Medicare-style public option, and have laid out specifics for the kind of public option they would support. They envision a public option that operates more like a private insurer and would only be available as a last resort. Under that type of scenario, the study says the number of people who would switch from private to public insurance could be as low as 21.5 million or 10.4 million. Which brings us to another problem: Rove says people would "be forced" to switch, but the report is modeled on the idea that consumers choose health plans based on price and would opt for a public plan — not be forced into one. Rove's comments give the impression that 120 million people would be booted out of their private insurance and forced to turn to the government. That's not the scenario the report describes. When we've covered this issue before, some of our readers have argued that we're missing the point. If millions of people choose to leave private insurance, the readers say, that would injure the private system to the point that government would have to step in — Rove's "bait and switch" argument. After people leave their private insurance for the public option, it would become too expensive for employers to continue to offer coverage to smaller pools of employees. But that's not how Rove described the report. He said, "The Lewin Group estimates 70 percent of people with private insurance — 120 million Americans — will quickly lose what they now get from private companies and be forced onto the government-run rolls as businesses decide it is more cost-effective for them to drop coverage." That's wrong. The report said that people would choose to leave private insurance if given a cheaper option, but the report provided smaller numbers for other options. The debate in Congress over what a public option will look like is fierce and ongoing. So Rove is picking the worst-case scenario and then distorting the cause and effects. We rate Rove's statement False.	None	Karl Rove	None	None	None	2009-06-12T14:01:30	2009-06-11	['United_States']
pomt-02847	"In Jeanne Shaheen, New Hampshire has a Senator who was the deciding vote to pass Obamacare."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2013/nov/19/jim-rubens/jim-rubens-claims-us-senator-jeanne-shaheen-d-nh-w/	With glitches continuing to hamper the federal health care website that went live in October 2013, a group of Senate Democrats is asking the White House to extend the open enrollment period for people to buy coverage. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and nine others say individuals shouldn’t be penalized for lack of coverage if they can’t get health insurance through the new website, healthcare.gov. They want to push back the March 31, 2014 enrollment deadline to compensate for the technical problems. "Extending this period will give consumers critical time in which to become familiar with the website and choose a plan that is best for them," the senators wrote to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. With Shaheen emerging as a leading voice in favor of extending the enrollment period, her opponents in New Hampshire are seizing the opportunity to remind voters that Shaheen was one of the Democrats who helped usher in the president’s health reform law in 2010. "In Jeanne Shaheen, New Hampshire has a Senator who was the deciding vote to pass Obamacare," wrote Republican Jim Rubens, who plans to challenge Shaheen next year, in a Nov. 4, 2013 email. New Hampshire GOP Chairwoman Jennifer Horn offered the same criticism. She said Shaheen’s call to extend the enrollment period is "too little, too late" and does nothing to address the "burdensome tax increases that Granite Staters will face as a result of the individual mandate." "Senator Jeanne Shaheen was the deciding vote in favor of ObamaCare, and she is the reason why New Hampshire families are dealing with disastrous consequences of this awful law," Horn said. It’s true that Shaheen voted to pass the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. But was she really the "deciding vote" in favor of the law? PolitiFact has seen numerous politicians called "the deciding vote" for Obamacare in the past. In Florida, a campaign ad from the 60 Plus Association attacked Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson for being "the deciding vote" for Obamacare. It was ruled Mostly False. PolitiFact Wisconsin looked at campaign literature from Republican Senate candidate Ron Johnson that claimed Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold "cast the deciding vote" for the health care bill in 2009. The claim earned a rating of Mostly False. In Michigan, a Republican committee said it was Sen. Debbie Stabenow. Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey and Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill have also been credited with casting the "deciding vote." The claims reflect the gamesmanship that every incumbent faces when opponents take a look at the voting record. Rather than just say the senator voted for a bill, the attackers up the ante by declaring it was the single vote that made the difference. In the case of the health care law, there’s a sliver of truth. All of the Democratic senators were needed to pass the bill. One of the key votes happened on Dec. 24, 2009, when 58 Democrats and two independents voted together in favor of the bill. (Sixty votes were needed for a preliminary cloture vote to prevent filibusters; otherwise the final vote couldn’t happen and the bill would have been blocked.) "Any one of those 60 Democrats who voted for it in the U.S. Senate, had they voted no, it would not have passed," Rubens said in an interview. "So any one of those 60 would have been the deciding vote." However, PolitiFact has been unsympathetic to that argument in the past, since calling someone "the deciding vote" implies he or she played a pivotal role, such as withholding support until the last moment. When it comes to the health care law, Shaheen wasn’t a holdout. If any Democratic senator deserves the distinction of clearing the way for the health reform law, it was then-Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska. As was widely reported at the time, Nelson delivered the 60th vote needed to send the bill to the floor of the Senate for a vote. Shaheen’s staff provided a few examples of her public comments in support of health care reform before the vote. "The status quo is simply not sustainable," Shaheen said on Sept. 23, 2009. "Now is the time to act." She repeated her call for health reform in floor speeches on Oct. 1, Dec. 7 and Dec. 14, 2009, saying the bill will begin to address soaring health care costs. Shaheen said years of "perverse incentives" have encouraged doctors to do more procedures rather than practice better medicine, and that the bill will shift the industry away from the fee-for-service model. "The many programs supported in the bill before us move us in the direction of delivery system reform, which is so important to our effort," Shaheen said on Dec. 15. "By promoting innovative practices like accountable care organizations, payment reform and medical homes, we can move away from the current fee-for-service system that rewards volume over value." As the horse-trading that produced the final Senate bill was underway, there was one brief period of tension between Shaheen and some members of the Democratic leadership. Shaheen signed a Dec. 11 letter to Senate President Harry Reid imploring him to reject a proposal to allow people to buy into Medicare at age 55. That notion was floated while negotiations were underway about including a public option in the health reform plan. But Shaheen and 11 other Senate Democrats said expanding the Medicare pool without changing reimbursement rates would exacerbate existing funding inequities in their states. The provision was dropped from the final health reform bill that passed the Senate at the end of 2009. Our ruling Rubens said Shaheen was "the deciding vote to pass Obamacare." It’s true that all 60 Democratic votes -- including Shaheen’s -- were needed to pass the measure through the Senate. However, Shaheen, unlike Ben Nelson, was hardly a holdout until the last minute; she gave indications early on that she supported the president’s reform plan. We rate Rubens’ claim Mostly False.

pomt-05370	"We are coming up on our 40th anniversary of electing a Republican to the United States Senate. 1972 was the last time New Jersey sent a Republican to the United States Senate."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/may/09/chris-christie/chris-christie-said-new-jersey-hasnt-sent-republic/	History bodes poorly for Republican Senate hopefuls in New Jersey. That’s because Richard Nixon was gearing up for a second term in the White House the last time New Jersey voters sent a GOP candidate to the U.S. Senate, according to Gov. Chris Christie. "We are coming up on our 40th anniversary of electing a Republican to the United States Senate. 1972 was the last time New Jersey sent a Republican to the United States Senate," Christie said in a May 4 speech at an event held by the libertarian Cato Institute. New Jersey’s presence in the House of Representatives remains relatively bipartisan. But have four decades passed since the state elected a Republican to the Senate? Outside of an eight-month stint by a Republican appointed in 1982, Democrats have held both Senate seats for more than three decades, PolitiFact New Jersey found. Clifford Case was the last Republican that New Jersey voters elected to the Senate, in 1972. That year he started his fourth term. He lost a bid for re-election in the 1978 GOP primary to Jeffrey Bell. Bill Bradley, a Democrat, defeated Bell in the 1978 general election, starting decades of Democratic dominance of New Jersey’s Senate seats. At least one Republican from New Jersey had served in the Senate in the 40 years leading up to Bradley’s victory, but Democrats have won every Senate election since then. Even in 1982 after Democrat Harrison Williams was forced from office for convictions on bribery and conspiracy charges as part of a federal corruption probe. A Republican briefly held Williams’ seat, but he was appointed, not elected. Then-Gov. Tom Kean in 1982 picked Republican Nicholas Brady to fill in for Williams, whose term ended the next year. Brady stepped down, however, after Frank Lautenberg won in the general election, defeating Republican Millicent Fenwick. Kean appointed Lautenberg to complete the final days of the term. Lautenberg started his first full term in January 1983 and served three six-year terms before leaving Washington, D.C. when he decided not to seek re-election. But he returned to Capitol Hill two years later in 2003 after replacing fellow Democrat Robert Torricelli on the ballot. Torricelli, who had served one term, quit his re-election bid in 2002 a month before voters headed to the polls because of questions about his ethics. Torricelli was reprimanded by the Senate Ethics Committee earlier that year over gifts he accepted from a campaign contributor. Lautenberg is serving his fifth term and is up for re-election in 2014. Robert Menendez, a Democrat, also represents New Jersey in the Senate. In 2006, Menendez replaced Jon Corzine, when the then-first-term Senator Corzine was elected New Jersey’s governor. Menendez won a full term to the Senate later that year. He is up for re-election this November against Republican Joe Kyrillos, who Christie has endorsed. Our ruling Christie said: "We are coming up on our 40th anniversary of electing a Republican to the United States Senate. 1972 was the last time New Jersey sent a Republican to the United States Senate." In 1972, New Jersey sent Republican Clifford Case to the U.S. Senate to serve a fourth term. Since then, New Jersey voters have not elected another GOP candidate to the Senate. And though a Republican from New Jersey briefly served in the Senate in 1982, he was appointed, not elected. We rate Christie’s statement True.

pomt-03574	Says paid family leave is "a program that is standard in all but five nations around the world."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2013/may/18/family-forward-oregon/paid-maternity-leave-really-standard-around-world/	Family Forward Oregon and other advocates of paid leave descended on the state Capitol this month with a Mother’s Day message for legislators: Want to be really mom-friendly? Skip the nosegays and pass legislation mandating paid maternity leave. "Mothers' work opportunities, health, and bonds with their children and partners are affected by the lack of paid family leave -- a program that is standard in all but five nations around the world," read a section of the flier distributed to lawmakers. We’ll be upfront. PolitiFact Oregon found it hard to believe developing nations could offer a work-related benefit that the United States does not. We were eager to truth squad this claim. Lisa Frack, spokeswoman for Family Forward Oregon, shared two sources: An infographic at the Huffington Post website and a New York Times article. Both remarked on our nation’s poor showing on paid leave for moms. We also did some online searching of our own and found that, apparently, it’s well known that the United States is out-of-step with developed nations when it comes to federal law mandating paid maternity leave. Private companies set their own policies, and employers such as Google offer generous leave programs to retain new mothers. States can also set their own rules. California and New Jersey require paid leave for new moms. Washington approved a paid leave requirement, but has yet to find a way to pay for it. But the default is the federal Family and Medical Leave Act, which calls for larger employers and government to allow a qualifying worker to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to have a baby or to care for a sick family member. Oregon law broadens the unpaid leave mandate to more employers and for more purposes, but there remain employees who don’t qualify or who can’t afford to take time off. Now, what about those other countries? The Central Intelligence Agency world fact book indicates there are about 267 "world entities," and of those, 193 are United Nations member states. The World Policy Analysis Center, housed in UCLA’s Fielding School of Public Health, confirmed policies for 188 of those countries. "Only the U.S., Papua New Guinea, Suriname, and 4 small Pacific islands (Nauru, Palau, Samoa, and Tonga) don’t guarantee mothers paid leave from work to care for their infant," wrote Amy Raub, principal research analyst with the World Policy Analysis Center, in an email to PolitiFact Oregon. Earlier news reports say the United States is one in three that lacks paid leave for new mothers. Family Forward has stated in a separate press release that we are one of four nations, not five. We’re not going to focus on the exact number -- except to remind speakers that sometimes, a general figure is better than a specific -- because it’s enough to say we are in the minority. Like, really in the minority. According to the center, even North Korea, which is ruled by a dictator, offers 11 weeks of paid maternity leave. Iraq, which was ruled by a dictator until 2003, offers nine weeks of paid leave. Bangladesh, where garment workers receive a minimum wage of $38 a month, offers 16 weeks of paid leave. Afghanistan requires 13 weeks, Pakistan 12 weeks. Which raises this question: How can working conditions for women -- in this respect -- be considered better in those countries than in the United States? We combed through an exhaustive 2010 report issued by the International Labour Organization, which reviewed maternity legislation for 167 countries. Again, the report confirms our outlier status. But the analysis also shows that not all women in countries where paid maternity leave is the standard are guaranteed full payment for the recommended length of time off, which is 14 weeks. For example, Japan requires 14 weeks of paid leave, but at a portion of regular pay and only if the employee is full-time and covered by health insurance, according to the ILO report. In other words, the ILO analysis shows that 59 percent of countries surveyed provided maternity leave that is "unpaid, paid at less than two-thirds of previous earnings, or paid for a period of less than 14 weeks." The United States is among those countries. We reached out to business representatives who might take issue with the statistic, but they couldn’t shed any light on how these policies really play out in other countries. Frack, the spokeswoman for Family Forward Oregon, said we asked good questions, but didn’t know either. Our ruling: The United States is rare in that the vast majority of countries surveyed have a government policy mandating paid maternity leave. The United States is really rare when compared to countries that are wealthy, developed. And again, we’re not going to quibble over the number of countries, because what we’re talking about is magnitude. We find the statement is accurate, but needs additional information. We’d caution readers to read the fine print. We rule the statement Mostly True. (Want to comment on this fact check?

pomt-00537	Currently, almost 40 percent of people with HIV are not diagnosed until they already have developed AIDS. And that can be up to 10 years after they first are infected with HIV.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/jun/19/fulton-county-health-and-wellness/many-get-hiv-diagnosis-only-after-developing-aids/	The health departments in Fulton and Dekalb counties are hosting a week of free HIV screenings that ends on National HIV Testing Day, June 27. The immediate goal of the Test Atlanta campaign, which starts Sunday, is to encourage people from age 13 to 64 to know their HIV status by getting tested, officials with Fulton County Health and Wellness said in a press release on June 16, 2015. "Finding out whether you are infected with HIV is the first step to getting connected to life-saving care," the release states. " It’s estimated almost 40 percent of people with HIV are not diagnosed until they have developed AIDS. That can be up to 10 years after they first became infected." Those statistics got our attention. PolitiFact Georgia decided to check further. We contacted Lyn Vaughn, risk communicator with Fulton County Health and Wellness, to ask the source of those statistics. She provided with us links to, and excerpts from, two statements, one from the Centers for Disease Control and one she said was from the National Association of People Living with AIDS, the group credited with starting the national testing day. The report from the CDC, issued in 2010, said nationally, the proportion of patients diagnosed with AIDS at or within 12 months of their HIV diagnosis in 2007 was 32 percent. We tried to contact officials with the association to ask about the source of their statistics but were unsuccessful. We later learned from the group’s web site that the association filed bankruptcy and closed its doors after 30 years in February 2013. The CDC, which supported National HIV Testing Day (NHTD) from its founding, continues to promote the annual event and advocate for routine HIV testing. According to the CDC, more than 1.2 million Americans are living with HIV, and almost one in seven or 14 percent are unaware of their infection. In the past decade, the number of people living with HIV has increased, but the annual number of new HIV infections has remained relatively stable -- at about 50,000 a year, the CDC reports. So what about that statistic? Vaughn later sent us additional information, including a recent news report on ongoing HIV testing available to patients who come through the emergency room at Atlanta’s Grady Memorial Hospital. Not all of the patients agree to be tested. But among those who were diagnosed as HIV infected between July 2013 and February of this year, nearly half had AIDS, according to data we received from Grady. The physician in charge of Grady’s program said many of the patients in the group that was subject of the report had been HIV positive for several years. The other data we looked at came from the state Department of Public Health. In Georgia, 24 percent of all newly diagnosed HIV patients in 2012 already had AIDS, the agency reported. That percentage also held true for 2013 as well, DPH reports show. We also circled back to the CDC, where the most recent data available is for 2012. Nationally, also, 24 percent of patients who were initially diagnosed with HIV infection were simultaneously diagnosed with AIDS, the CDC reported in 2012. Most of those people were likely infected for many years without knowing it, the CDC said. Our ruling The press release from Fulton County Health and Wellness promoting the week of testing for HIV states that almost 40 percent of people with the virus are not diagnosed until they already have developed AIDS. And that can be up to 10 years after they first are infected. That specific statistic reportedly came from a national organization that is no longer in operation and appears high compared to the 24 percent figure reported t by the state and CDC. But that still supports the health department’s overarching point about the need for early testing and treatment. For that reason, we rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-13319	Maggie Hassan "raised tuition, making it the highest in America."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/oct/06/national-republican-senatorial-committee/did-magggie-hassan-raise-tuition-making-new-hampsh/	Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan has made college affordability a central part of her campaign for U.S. Senate, and she often notes that New Hampshire’s university system froze tuition for the first time in 25 years under her administration in stump speeches. But Republicans are now trying to use Hassan’s higher education record against her as she tries to unseat U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a Republican, in the November election. A few days ago, we fact-checked a claim, made in a National Republican Senatorial Committee television ad, that Hassan had skipped out on most University System of New Hampshire meetings. We found that claim to be Mostly True. That ad also included the claim that Hassan had "raised tuition, making it the highest in America." Our readers asked us: is that true? PolitiFact decided to take a look. We reached out to the NRSC, which pointed to an executive order issued by Gov. Hassan in November of 2014. That order rescinded $3 million in state funding for the USNH, which oversees the University of New Hampshire, Keene State College, Plymouth State College, and Granite State College. The take-back came in the midst of a budget crunch and was applied during the fiscal year ending in 2015, or the 2014-15 school year. That one-time $3 million take-back didn’t result in an immediate tuition increase. University leaders looked to the following state budget for enough funding to continue an ongoing tuition freeze. Among the things The NRSC pointed to were comments made by UNH president Mark Huddleston in an Associated Press article saying that tuition was a "straight-line function of how New Hampshire invests." So let’s look at how New Hampshire funds higher education through the state budget. During the 2009-10 and 2010-11 school years, the university system received $100 million annually from the state. But a Legislature led by then-House Speaker Bill O’Brien, a Republican, slashed funding basically in half, allocating $51 million and $54 million for the 2011-12 and 2012-13 school years. After the cuts, the university system announced a nearly 10 percent increase in tuition. Hassan then took office in 2013 and oversaw a partial restoration in funding, with the university system receiving $69 million and $84 million in the state budget for the following two school years. In return, USNH trustees agreed to a two-year tuition freeze covering the 2013-14 and 2014-15 academic years. In September 2014, USNH leaders promised to continue that freeze for another two years if the Legislature and governor approved a budget that included $100 million in state aid to the system in fiscal year 2016 and $105 million in fiscal year 2017, restoring it to pre-O’Brien levels. After the $3 million take-back was announced in November 2014, the USNH did not change its budget request -- suggesting it didn’t play a very important role. So what happened during the budget process? Hassan proposed USNH receive $87 million in 2016 and $94 million in 2017. USNH responded with a statement saying the proposed budget was "insufficient to continue the tuition freeze." University system leaders later scaled back their request, asking for $90 million in 2016 and $95 million in 2017. A Republican-controlled House ultimately approved a budget that provided $19 million less than Hassan had requested -- $81 million in both 2016 and 2017. That’s when the university system announced it would be raising tuition. In other words, during Hassan’s first budget, funding was restored enough for the university system to freeze tuition for two years. In the following budget years, state aid fell short of what USNH leaders said they needed to continue a freeze. It is also important to note that while state aid plays an important role in setting tuition, it is not the Legislature nor the Governor who set tuition rates for the USNH. It is the Board of Trustees. As governor, Hassan sits on that board, and, like governors before her, has missed most of the trustees’ meetings. Perhaps symbolically, the one meeting on June 28, 2013 that she participated in, she made the motion to freeze tuition at the university system. But had she attended other meetings and voted against raising tuition on June 26, 2015, when the board approved the hikes, she still wouldn’t have been able to swing the vote the other way. And while USNH leaders like to say that state aid in practice determines tuition rates, there’s probably some wiggle room. "The loss of state appropriations does not fully explain the increases to the cost of public higher education in New Hampshire. Between 2003 and 2011, average tuition rates within the University System rose nearly 40 percent – even with tuition rates adjusted for inflation ... During the same time period, state appropriations per full-time equivalent student decreased by less than 12 percent," according to A New Hampshire Center for Public Policy Studies report from 2014 analyzed public higher education spending in New Hampshire. Highest in the nation? The NRSC also pointed to a College Board report that said New Hampshire had the highest in-state tuition for four-year institutions in the country in the 2015-2016 year. That’s correct, but New Hampshire’s public college affordability crisis predates Hassan’s tenure as governor. When she took office in January 2013, the Granite State already had the highest in-state tuition in the country for four-year schools, according to the College Board. The television ad also doesn’t specify that it is referring to four-year colleges. Under Hassan, two-year community colleges have frozen tuition for several years running. Community colleges in New Hampshire are also not the most expensive in the country. During the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 school years, that distinction belonged to Vermont, according to the College Board. All of these things are correct: Hassan did make a one-time $3 million rescission from the university system for the 2014-15 year, New Hampshire did have the highest tuition rate in the country for public four-year schools in 2015-2016, and tuition did rise under Hassan’s tenure. But these things do not add up to Hassan raising tuition. While the governor played an important role in setting the budget that heavily influenced tuition rates, she was one among many players, and the University System is the one that sets tuition rates, not the governor. Our ruling The National Senatorial Committee says Maggie Hassan "raised tuition, making it the highest in America." For starters, in-state tuition in New Hampshire for four-year colleges has been the highest in America for years, but it was that way before Hassan took office. As for Hassan’s role as governor, of the two budgets she crafted, one gave the university system enough money to freeze tuition, according to USNH leaders, and the other one didn’t. Additionally, the state budget does not dictate tuition rates, the board of trustees does. In addition, the Republican-controlled Legislature pared down what Hassan offered in her budget proposal. The statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-10693	"Senator Obama's relatives and friends say he has been talking about running for president for at least the last 15 years," a campaign spokesman said.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/06/hillary-clinton/ridiculous-evidence-but-true/	The campaign of Sen. Hillary Clinton recently trotted out quotes from Sen. Barack Obama's kindergarten teacher to prove that he's been aiming for the White House longer than he admits. Seriously. The conflict between the top Democrats running for president began when Obama said this: "I have not been planning to run for president for however number of years some of the other candidates have been planning for." The Clinton campaign responded with a thoroughly researched news release that culled details from Obama's life that had been reported in feature articles about him. "Senator Obama's relatives and friends say he has been talking about running for president for at least the last 15 years," the Clinton news release said. "So who's not telling the truth, them or him?" The evidence: • Former classmates who said that when he was at Harvard Law School, Obama was "thinking about politics." • A brother-in-law saying Obama told him in the early 1990s that he was interested in a run for president. • An essay Obama wrote in third grade called, "I want to be a president." • An essay he wrote in kindergarten called, "I Want To Become President." PolitiFact set out to confirm those sources. Brad Berenson, a classmate and friend of Obama's at Harvard Law School in the early 1990s, said: "I certainly never heard him say directly or indirectly that he wanted to be president of the United States. That kind of sentiment would have been absurdly presumptuous at that point." Now, Obama spent some of his early years in Indonesia, including kindergarten and third grade. We started to track down those teachers living on the other side of the world, but then we realized this goose chase wasn't worth the effort. The Obama campaign is not denying the accuracy of the Clinton reports. Anita Dunn, a Democratic strategist, says there's no doubt the Clinton campaign has some facts on its side. "The overall thematic attack that he is out there saying that he is somehow different from someone else in the field, that he is somehow propelled into this race … I think that's absolutely fair game for the Clinton camp to go after," said Dunn, a Democratic strategist not aligned with a candidate, but who worked as a consultant to Obama's Hopefund PAC for six months in 2006. "On the other hand, were they wise in the example they used?" It does appear that Obama expressed ambition for the office of president many years ago. We wish we had a ruling category called "True, but ridiculous." We don't, so we're left with True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2007-12-06T00:00:00	2007-12-02	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-04992	The transportation sales tax would cost the average consumer an estimated $112 a year.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/jul/20/john-watson/will-t-splost-add-112-year-consumers/	The poor penny. Some politicians want to get rid of it. It often gets lost in the living room sofa or underneath the car seat. Pennies, though, can add up. Supporters of the July 31 transportation referendum say a penny-per-dollar sales tax would pay for scores of mass transit and road projects that would ease congestion in the Atlanta region. One referendum proponent recently said the extra penny added on to items that may cost a buck is well worth it in exchange for the transportation improvements it would fund. In fact, he said the annual cost would be less than how much it costs the average Atlanta-area resident to be stuck in traffic a year -- $924. PolitiFact Georgia previously rated the $924 claim Mostly True. PolitiFact Georgia saw the following statement and wondered how close to the truth was this claim. "An additional penny will cost the average consumer an estimated $112 annually. In exchange, they’ll get traffic relief, more income-producing time at work and more leisure time at home," John Watson wrote in The Marietta Daily Journal. Watson is a senior adviser to Citizens for Transportation Mobility, an organization leading the push to get the hotly debated referendum passed. He served as a chief of staff to Sonny Perdue when he was governor.. The Atlanta Regional Commission, which has provided technical and research assistance to local and state officials involved in the referendum, compiled a report on the sales tax impact of the referendum. One chart contained an estimated final resident cost for each year of the referendum. The average per resident, ARC calculated, was $112 a year. Referendum supporters estimate the tax would, when taking inflation into account, raise as much as $8.5 billion over the 10 years it would be in effect. That estimate came from state tax revenue forecasts. The 10 metro Atlanta counties that would collect the tax are Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, Gwinnett, Henry and Rockdale. ARC’s first step in coming up with the estimate was to determine what percentage of the funds would come from metro Atlanta residents as opposed to tourists and businesses. Its estimate is 65 percent of the revenue would come from residents. ARC officials then estimated the population in the 10-county area that will vote on the referendum and projected the region’s growth over the 10-year period. ARC believes the region’s population will be about 4.3 million residents in 2013. In 2022, the ARC projection is 4.86 million. ARC estimates an average population growth of nearly 56,000 people a year. Population in the 10-county region rose by an average of 69,000 a year between 2000 and 2010, U.S. Census figures show. "It’s a pretty conservative population forecast," ARC planner Jim Skinner said. Divide the estimated sales tax revenue by the number of residents and the math equals ARC’s estimate of $112 a year per person, as Watson said in the op-ed. PolitiFact Georgia, however, had a question about the numbers. The population estimate is for all residents, including those under age 18. The percentage of residents under age 18 in the region ranges from a low of nearly 24 percent in Fulton County to a high of 29 percent in Clayton County. We know many children like to play with pennies, but they spend less than their parents. Should they be included in the estimate? Skinner said ARC was not asked to do a breakdown by age. He also said some agencies conduct research on taxes and use the entire state population. Bert Brantley, who is assisting Citizens for Transportation Mobility with media relations and public outreach in support of the referendum, said the larger point is still the amount of money people could pay in sales taxes for transportation is much less than the estimated annual cost to be stuck in traffic. "Now obviously, not every resident in the region is a commuter, but we all already pay a congestion tax in wasted time and fuel, so this is not a tax vs. no tax argument," said Brantley, a former communications director for Perdue. PolitiFact Georgia calculated how much each resident would pay a year in additional sales tax, excluding people under age 18. Our estimate: $132.37 a year. The total comes close to ARC’s estimate. With this bit of context that ARC’s estimate includes all residents in the 10-county area, we rate Watson’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-03309	Under Obamacare, "75 percent of small businesses now say they are going to be forced to either fire workers or cut their hours."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/29/marco-rubio/sen-marco-rubio-says-75-small-businesses-say-theyl/	Sen. Marco Rubio says it’s not too late to stop Obamacare. In fact, he says, Congress should refuse to pass a spending bill that funds it, even at the risk of shutting down government. That’s because he sees "mounting evidence of how Obamacare creates more problems than it solves, particularly for small business owners and the people who work for them." One of those pieces of evidence: the number of small business who "say they are going to be forced to either fire workers or cut their hours." According to his FoxNews.com op-ed on July 25, 2013, that number is a jaw-dropping 75 percent. (He repeated the claim in a July 29 piece for RedState.com, "Shut Down Obamacare, Not Government.") Rubio blames the health care law’s now-delayed employer mandate, which requires businesses with the equivalent of 50 or more full-time employees to offer affordable, comprehensive health coverage or potentially face penalties of $2,000 or more per full-time worker after the first 30. That creates a disastrous disincentive, he argues: "If you are a small business with about 47, 48 or 49 employees and you want to hire more people, Obamacare encourages you to hold back on hiring new workers or cut the hours of existing ones so that you don’t reach 50 employees. That is why 75 percent of small businesses now say they are going to be forced to either fire workers or cut their hours." Do three in four American small businesses say the health care law will drive them to fire workers or cut their hours? Survey says Rubio’s not alone in his distaste for the employer mandate, which has detractors on the right and left. Even some supporters of the health care law don’t like the way the mandate’s structured, noting that it may discourage hiring and create an incentive to keep workers under 30 hours. But do 75 percent of small businesses say they face that pressure? Rubio’s office provided us with a July 16, 2013, Washington Examiner article headlined "74% of small businesses will fire workers, cut hours under Obamacare," which begins: "Despite the administration's controversial decision to delay forcing companies to join Obamacare for a year, three-quarters of small businesses are still making plans to duck the costly law by firing workers, reducing hours of full-time staff, or shift many to part-time, according to a sobering survey released by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce." It goes on to summarize results from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s quarterly Small Business Outlook Study. We read the the study and reached out to the chamber. And there’s a problem with that "three-quarters of small businesses" claim. Well, a series of problems, actually. Categories don’t add up The study was conducted among a national sample of 1,300 executives for small businesses, defined as fewer than 500 employees and with annual revenue less than $25 million. It included chamber members and non-members "weighted to be representative of the small business population." But it turns out the question the Washington Examiner and Rubio cited wasn’t asked of the entire group — something not clear in the published results. The chamber told us executives were first asked whether the employer mandate would affect them: As a result of the health care law, the employer mandate will require employers with more than 50 full-time workers to offer health coverage to all full-time employees and their dependents or face a penalty. The law defines a full-time employee as someone who works 30 hours per week and the penalty is based on the number of full-time employees. Will you be impacted by the employer mandate? Just 17 percent of the small business executives said yes. So less than one in five businesses that participated in the survey said that the employer mandate would even affect them. Those 17 percent were then asked how they planned to respond. They could select as many answers as they felt applied to them: Please indicate how your business will react to this new mandate. Please select all that apply. a. Reduce hiring to avoid surpassing the 50 full-time equivalent employees (24 percent) b. Cut back hours to reduce the number of full-time employees (27 percent) c. Stop providing employee health insurance d. Replace full-time employees with part-time workers (23 percent) e. None of the above The chamber published responses for answers A, B and D — the responses cited by the Washington Examiner and Rubio. It has not provided responses for answers C and E. So, the only way to reach 75 percent is to not only ignore the majority of executives who didn’t answer the question, but also to fold those who said they would "reduce hiring" with those who planned to cut hours or replace workers. And we just don’t know how many employers said, "None of the above." It’s also not clear from published results exactly what percentage of affected businesses said they would cut hours or replace workers. It could be as high as 50 percent, assuming there was no overlap between the executives who said they planned to replace full-timers with part-timers and those who said they would cut back hours. It could be as low as 27 percent, assuming total overlap — that the same people who said they would replace full-timers with part-timers also said they intended to cut back hours. So, of all small businesses in the study, how many said they would cut back hours or replace full-time workers in response to the health care law? Just 5 percent to 9 percent. And that’s in line with other evidence. Most companies have 10 employees or less — far from the 50-employee threshold. Meanwhile, of firms with 25 to 49 people — a group Rubio said he was concerned about — 87 percent already offer health benefits, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation’s annual employer survey. Of those with 50 to 199 employees — the smallest businesses actually subject to penalties in 2015 for not offering insurance — 94 percent already offer benefits. Meanwhile, under the law, businesses with fewer than 25 employees may already qualify for tax credits for offering coverage — an extra boost they didn’t get before. Still, surveys show small businesses are worried. A May Gallup poll commissioned by an employment law firm showed that 41 percent have held off on plans to hire new employees, 19 percent have reduced workers, and 18 percent have reduced employees’ hours to part time. Part of the problem, said Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow in the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute, is that small employers don’t actually know yet how the law will affect them. Only 30 percent of respondents in the U.S. Chamber’s small business survey said they were prepared — including understanding what’s required to participate in health care insurance exchanges. "There's a lot of misinformation and a lot of ideology out there," Blumberg said. Our ruling Rubio, arguing to defund Obamacare, said "75 percent of small businesses now say they are going to be forced to either fire workers or cut their hours." That’s not remotely true. In the study of small businesses he cited, less than 10 percent said they might make that choice. His office cited a news article that misinterpreted ambiguous results from an interest-group survey.

pomt-04576	"The truth is, Planned Parenthood does not provide mammograms. Planned Parenthood refers women to mammography providers, serving as the middlewoman, if you will."	true	/georgia/statements/2012/sep/25/karen-handel/karen-handel-seeks-set-record-straight-komen-plann/	Former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel came out firing on all cylinders in her book, "Planned Bullyhood." Handel, who most recently served as the former vice president of public policy at Susan G. Komen for the Cure, included criticisms of Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal, state politics and decisions at Komen. Included in the book is a detailed account of this year’s much-publicized controversy at the breast cancer nonprofit organization. In early February, Komen announced it would no longer make grants to organizations that were under local, state or federal investigation. Planned Parenthood, which received more than $600,000 annually from Komen to perform breast examinations and conduct breast health education at 19 of its centers, was facing an investigation by Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., into whether the organization had violated a prohibition against using federal funds for abortion services. After a firestorm of criticism, Komen reversed its decision, and Handel resigned less than a week later. Some critics suggested Handel was behind Komen’s policy decision. But in her book, Handel says Komen had considered ending the relationship with Planned Parenthood "for at least a decade," as Komen restructured its grant model to focus on measurable outcomes to fighting breast cancer. That focus, she said, excluded much of what Planned Parenthood did. In her book, Handel makes pointed statements regarding Planned Parenthood’s services, noting that the organization promoted itself as a provider of mammograms to poor women. "The truth is, Planned Parenthood does not provide mammograms," she wrote. "Planned Parenthood refers women to mammography providers, serving as the middlewoman, if you will." We wondered whether this was true of the organization known for being a key player in women’s health issues. Does Planned Parenthood really not provide mammograms? And, if not, how does the organization handle the services? And does it receive or provide funding for the work? The argument over mammography and other services at Planned Parenthood has been ongoing for several years. Much of the debate centers on a congressional push last year to cut funding to Planned Parenthood, which has been cited as the country’s leading abortion provider. The federal government pays Planned Parenthood about $75 million a year to offer cancer screenings, breast exams and other care to lower-income women. That money cannot be spent on abortion services. The funding cut, which passed the House, was shot down in the Senate. Organization President Cecile Richards denounced the cuts in February 2011 on HLN’s "The Joy Behar Show." During that interview, Richards said that if the bill to cut funding ever became law, millions of women in the country would lose access to health care, not to abortion services but to basic family planning services, such as mammograms and cancer screenings. Richards was immediately challenged on her statement by the California-based anti-abortion group Live Action, which secretly recorded phone conversations between an actress and employees at various Planned Parenthood clinics. The actress, supposedly seeking a mammogram, was told the service was not available and in some cases was referred elsewhere. Richards said her comments on Behar’s show were taken out of context. So are mammograms on Planned Parenthood’s service menu? We asked, and in an email response, a spokeswoman for the organization said doctors and nurses at Planned Parenthood health centers provide clinical breast exams and refer patients to facilities with technicians for mammograms based on breast exams, age or family history. Planned Parenthood also refers women to breast specialists when a potential abnormality is found and follow-up tests are needed. And with the organization’s expanded breast health initiative, Planned Parenthood will be able to cover the cost of this specialized care for more women, the email said. Handel’s statement that Planned Parenthood doesn’t provide mammograms and only refers clients for those services at other facilities is supported by the organization itself. We rate the claim True.

pomt-10512	John McCain and George Bush have "absolutely no plan for universal health care."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/17/campaign-defend-america/no-mandate-no-universal-care/	After attacking Sen. John McCain and President George W. Bush on Iraq, taxes and energy, an ad from the Campaign to Defend America finally turns to health care. "Absolutely no plan for universal health care. McSame as Bush." Universal health care has been much debated in the Democratic primary campaign, but hardly mentioned on the Republican side. The consensus among health care experts is that to achieve universal health care — the intention to cover every person with no exceptions — there must be a legal requirement for care, such as a mandate for individuals to buy insurance . In the Democratic primary campaign, Sen. Hillary Clinton supports an individual mandate, while Sen. Barack Obama opposes it on the grounds that its implementation could penalize the working poor. Bush does not support any sort of health care mandate, nor does McCain. "On health care we trust patients to make decisions, not bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.," Bush said on March 13, 2008, at a Republican Congresional Committee dinner. At a health care forum on Oct. 31, 2007, hosted by the Kaiser Family Foundation, McCain said he opposed mandates, even while discussing plans to improve access to health care. "I don't think that there should be a mandate for every American to have health insurance. I think that one of our goals should be that every American own their own home. But I'm not going to mandate that every American own their own home," McCain said. McCain does have a health care plan, but there's no clause for making it apply to everyone and therefore universal. So we find this claim to be True.	None	Campaign to Defend America	None	None	None	2008-03-17T00:00:00	2008-03-05	['John_McCain', 'George_W._Bush']
pomt-12024	Says PolitiFact reported that "95 percent of what (Donald Trump) says is a lie."	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/sep/18/joy-behar/joy-behar-politifact-said-trump-lies-95-percent-ti/	The View co-host Joy Behar gave a selective — and frankly, incorrect — reading of PolitiFact’s rulings on President Donald Trump’s statements during an on-air debate with White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Behar brought up Trump’s Truth-O-Meter record during the Sept. 6, 2017, episode of the ABC talk show, asking Sanders how she thought the press should report on his statements. A reader emailed us asking if Behar was accurately describing our rulings, so we took a closer look at the exchange. "Is the media supposed to not report on the fact that 95 percent of what he says is a lie?" Behar asked. "The problem with that, Joy, is that is, you are doing exactly what we are talking about and pushing a false narrative," Sanders replied. "Ninety-five percent of what the president says is not a lie." "No, it’s not," Behar said. "It’s from PolitiFact." It appeared that Behar was referring to Trump’s PolitiFact file, which tracks every statement we’ve rated on the Truth-O-Meter. We compile the results of a person's most interesting or provocative statements in their file to provide a broad overview of the kinds of statements they tend to make. A spokeswoman for The View didn’t clarify Behar’s claim by our deadline. As of Sept. 6, 21 of the 446 statements we examined earned a True rating. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com That is only 5 percent. Does that mean he lied 95 percent of the time? In a word, no. While we appreciate being a part of a discussion about the facts, Behar wasn’t using our file on Trump properly. Let’s take some time to re-examine what the Truth-O-Meter does and doesn’t do. Meter reader There’s no question Trump has a shaky relationship with the truth. His campaign misstatements earned our 2015 Lie of the Year award, and his Truth-O-Meter record was much worse than Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton during the presidential campaign. His tendency to play loose with facts has continued into his presidency. We’ve given him Pants On Fire ratings for gross distortions saying Charlottesville, Va., counter-protesters didn’t have a permit; that CNN’s ratings have suffered mightily; and that allegations his campaign colluded with Russia "is a made-up story." He’s also received False ratings for saying President Barack Obama’s immigration policies led to an upswing in MS 13 gang activity; that his own administration did more in the first 90 days than any other presidency; and that he’s saved "millions of jobs" since becoming president. Overall, he’s earned 147 False ratings (33 percent of all the Trump rulings we’ve made) and 69 Pants on Fire ratings (15 percent). Those statements are provably wrong. But to call the rest lies, as Behar did, doesn’t reflect the Truth-O-Meter’s design. We define our ratings in our description of our fact-checking process, which helps us determine the veracity of a statement we’ve chosen to check: TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim. So when we rate a statement something less than True but more than False, the speaker can be accurate to some degree, but incorrect because it’s omitting an important angle, being used in the wrong context or drawing a bad conclusion. For example: When Trump tweeted in February, "The National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion," he was using a real statistic from the U.S. Treasury Department. He was clearly attempting to make it appear he was responsible for the decrease. But experts we interviewed said not only did the national debt fluctuate on a regular basis as it continued an inexorable upward climb, there was no way Trump enacted policies leading to the minor (and temporary) drop. We rated Trump’s tweet Mostly False. Trump has received 52 Mostly True ratings, 64 Half True ratings, and 93 Mostly False ratings. Also keep in mind that a person’s PolitiFact file isn’t a comprehensive look at every single statement they make, nor is it a random sample of what they say. It would be logistically impossible for PolitiFact to make informed rulings on every single comment an official makes. We choose to fact-check statements that are interesting to us or to readers, or that are relevant to policy discussions or the news of the day. The content of the statements can sometimes repeat, as well, landing another rating in the file. We’ve rated Trump’s assertion that America is the highest-taxed nation in the world four times over two years, each earning a False rating. This is not to beat a dead horse, but rather to address Trump’s repetition of the falsehood during the campaign. Our ruling Behar said PolitiFact reported that "95 percent of what (Trump) says is a lie." That’s a misreading of Trump’s file, which notes that of the 446 statements we’ve examined, only 5 percent earned a True rating. We’ve rated Trump’s statements False or Pants On Fire a total of 48 percent of the time. The definitions of our Truth-O-Meter ratings make it difficult to call the bulk of Trump’s statements outright lies. The files we keep for people's statements act as a scorecard of the veracity of their most interesting claims. Keep in mind that the statements we rate are neither a random nor comprehensive look at things Trump has said. Behar oversimplified when invoking our Truth-O-Meter rulings. We rate her statement False. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Joy Behar	None	None	None	2017-09-18T17:00:00	2017-09-06	['None']
pomt-08546	As Milwaukee County executive, Scott Walker "eliminated the waiting list for long-term care for older adults through the Family Care program."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/01/scott-walker/republican-governor-candidate-scott-walker-says-he/	As Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker seeks a promotion to governor, Democrats have waged a steady attack, accusing him of gutting important services in a single-minded push to cut taxes. So, it’s no surprise to hear Walker, a Republican, highlight a popular program that has grown steadily on his watch. Case in point: Family Care -- the long-term care program for seniors. Walker did it in a fever-pitch victory speech on primary election night: "Before I took office, there was literally a waiting list of 3,000 older adults waiting for long-term care in our community. Today not one senior in our community is on a waiting list because we stood up and led the way. We can do it for the state as well." On the biography section of his campaign website, he more directly takes credit: "As County Executive (Scott) ... eliminated the waiting list for long-term care for older adults through the Family Care program." So, has the waiting list disappeared? And is Walker correct in claiming credit for it? When we asked the Walker campaign for backup on the claim, Walker returned the call himself -- and took personal responsibility for what he said was an error in his primary night statement. The waiting list, he said, actually had been 2,500 -- not 3,000. Good to know, but our main interest was whether it disappeared. Let’s dig into the claim. Family Care was designed to provide better care for seniors and end the waiting list for services. The program now provides 6,400 older adults in the county with residential options, transportation, meals and other services. Indeed, there was no need for Walker to fall on his sword -- the state department that tracks Family Care enrollment says the list did reach 3,000 at one point. The list started shrinking in mid-2000, when Milwaukee County and four other counties started pilot projects under the Family Care program, according to multiple sources we interviewed. The program is administered by the county, but the state funds most of its budget. A host of public documents and sources in and out of state and local government show the waiting list for the Family Care program was eliminated as of the end of June 2002. And Walker was executive at the time, though he was sworn in less than 2 months earlier. So that part of Walker’s statement is correct: There was a big waiting list before he took office, and today no one waits. That leaves the larger question of who deserves credit, the main point in Walker’s touting of the success of the program. For that, a timetable is important. We based this chronology on county and state audits, budget documents, newspaper stories and the recollection of key players: 1995: Health officials in the administration of then-Gov. Tommy Thompson launch redesign of long-term care in Wisconsin, including nursing home, community- and home-based care. 1998: Thompson announces the selection of Milwaukee as a Family Care county, after years of lobbying led by Stephanie Sue Stein, the county’s Department on Aging chief. 1999: State lawmakers and Thompson approve Family Care funding in the state budget bill. At the time, Walker was serving in the state Assembly from Wauwatosa and supported the budget as a member of the Republican majority. 2000: Pilot program in Milwaukee County starts up. 2001: In November, the Milwaukee County Board and then-County Executive F. Thomas Ament approve a county budget that fully phases in Family Care during 2002. It keeps the county on course to extinguish the waiting list by June 2002. 2002, May 9: Walker is sworn in as Ament’s successor after winning an April special election prompted by Ament’s forced retirement amid the county pension scandal. 2002, July 1: Family Care is fully up and running, and the waiting list is a thing of the past. The timeline makes clear the waiting list was on a track to be eliminated well before Walker took office -- and nearly gone by the time he won the job. Walker’s primary-night phrase -- "We stood up and led the way" -- appears to point voters to the early days of the fight to get the Family Care pilot program approved for the county. At the time, Walker was not yet county executive and does not appear to have played a role in the Legislature beyond joining a bipartisan group to support of the pilot programs. Walker argues that his actions since taking county office have kept a waiting list from redeveloping. He points out -- correctly -- that he and other county officials battled the state over adequate funding, especially after deficits threatened the program. The program gets almost all of its funding from Madison, so keeping it going is far easier than other county programs that rely heavily on local property taxes. And in 2004, Walker and the County Board put $12.2 million in county funds into Family Care to bring it back from insolvency. During his tenure, the program has grown from serving some 2,900 seniors in the spring of 2002 to serving more than 6,400 seniors in Milwaukee County today. Walker gets praise from a key advocate for seniors, Tom Frazier, the former head of the Coalition of Wisconsin Aging Groups. "Scott Walker has been extremely supportive," Frazier said. Let’s take stock. Walker’s claim on the end of the waiting list is accurate -- and he did play a role both in starting the program (minor) and keeping it going (more substantive). But the central part of the claim is that as county executive he eliminated the waiting list. That list ended less than two months after he took office and mainly through the efforts of county officials who preceded him. Walker has supported the program as county executive, but nearly all of the heavy lifting on the waiting list was done before he arrived on the scene. And preventing a waiting list from reappearing is different than taking credit for ending it. We rate Walker’s statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04711	Says Chris Christie was the "first governor in America to endorse" Mitt Romney.	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/sep/03/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-he-was-first-governor-endors/	Before Gov. Chris Christie made his case in primetime last week for why Mitt Romney should be elected president, the governor pointed to his original endorsement in October as evidence that he truly believes in the Republican nominee. Leading up to his keynote address Tuesday at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla., Christie dismissed a New York Post article claiming he doubted Romney could defeat President Barack Obama. As part of his rebuttal, Christie repeated a line he's said before: he was the first governor to endorse Romney. "I’ve spent since October of last year -- first governor in America to endorse him -- (running) around the country to 15 different states campaigning for him and raising money," Christie said in an interview Tuesday on "CBS This Morning." "I didn’t do that ‘cause I had nothing else to do," Christie continued. "I did it because I believe the guy’s the best guy to be president and that he can win." But PolitiFact New Jersey found that Christie’s claim is off. He was one of the first Republican governors to back Romney, but not the first. The governor's office did not respond last week to an email presenting our findings. Here are the facts: A week after announcing he wouldn’t make a presidential run himself, Christie traveled to New Hampshire and endorsed Romney on Oct. 11, 2011. "I’m here in New Hampshire today for one simple reason: America cannot survive another four years of Barack Obama, and Mitt Romney is the man we need to lead America and we need him now," Christie said during a news conference. But about four months earlier, the Romney campaign announced he had the support of two other Republican governors: Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman and Idaho Gov. Butch Otter. The campaign announced Heineman's endorsement in a June 10, 2011 news release posted on its website. "Mitt Romney has a proven record of balancing budgets, keeping taxes low, and creating an environment for job growth," Heineman said in the news release. "As a governor, I understand the challenges this country faces and Mitt Romney has the experience to meet those challenges." In a June 20, 2011 news release on its website, the campaign said Otter would serve as co-chairman of Romney's Idaho Statewide Steering Committee. "Mitt Romney has the experience needed to grow the economy and create jobs," Otter said in the release. In the months ahead, news articles noted both governors’ endorsements. "Romney has been endorsed by two governors, Dave Heineman of Nebraska and Butch Otter of Idaho, as well as one former governor, Colorado’s Bill Owens," according to a July 2, 2011 article on the Washington Post’s website. A Politico article on July 16, 2011 pointed out how only a few governors -- including Heineman and Otter -- had handed out endorsements in the GOP presidential primary race: "Only a small handful of Republican governors have endorsed in the presidential race, with Govs. Dave Heineman of Nebraska and Butch Otter of Idaho backing Mitt Romney, and Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal endorsing Newt Gingrich." In a Dec. 1 article in the New York Times, Heineman was identified as "the first governor to endorse Mr. Romney." Our ruling In light of a New York Post article claiming Christie doubted whether Romney could beat Obama, Christie claimed in a TV interview that he was the "first governor in America to endorse" Romney. But about four months before Christie offered his endorsement, the Romney campaign announced he had the support of Republican governors in Nebraska and Idaho, and news articles noted both endorsements afterward. We rate the statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-05642	"New Jersey loses net, that is minus those who come into the state, 30,000 students a year."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/mar/22/susan-cole/state-college-president-claims-new-jersey-experien/	The president of Montclair State University said one fact illuminates the problems with the state’s higher education system: many New Jersey students attend college elsewhere. Susan Cole recently appeared on NJTV where she argued that the state has failed to invest in the higher education infrastructure, including buildings and faculty, needed to make New Jersey competitive and economically prosperous. Asked in the March 13 interview how far the state is from where it needs to be in this area, Cole said: "The gap is huge and it is most evident if you look at the net out-migration of students from New Jersey. New Jersey loses net, that is minus those who come into the state, 30,000 students a year. That's every year, year after year, 30,000 of our best prepared, most educated students leave the state for other states." Are tens of thousands of college students leaving the Garden State? Yes. A report released last year by the New Jersey Higher Education Task Force, a committee appointed by Gov. Chris Christie, said: "In part because of a lack of college capacity, New Jersey has a too-long history of losing more college-bound students than attend in-state." The National Center for Education Statistics, a research arm of the U.S. Department of Education, keeps tabs on where students choose to pursue education after high school. In fall 2008, the most recent data available, 36,135 New Jersey residents enrolled for the first time in an out-of-state institution granting at least an associate’s degree. At the same time 5,268 first-time freshmen came to New Jersey, for a net loss of 30,867 students. Diane Reed, a spokeswoman for Montclair State University, confirmed that’s the data Cole was referencing in the television interview. In comparison, New Jersey lost a net total of 29,559 of first-time freshmen in fall 2006. A decade before that the state lost 20,005 students. The National Center for Education Statistics also narrows the data to focus on freshmen who graduated high school in the last year and freshmen attending a four-year institution who graduated high school in the last year. Both groups experienced a net loss of students close to the figure Cole cited. New Jersey lost a net total of 27,819 freshmen who graduated high school in the last year and 27,343 freshmen attending four-year institutions who graduated high school in the last year, according to the most recent data. By all three measures, more students left New Jersey then came to the state in the fall of 2008 for a postsecondary education than any other state in the nation. Our ruling The president of Montclair State University said: "New Jersey loses net, that is minus those who come into the state, 30,000 students a year." According to the most recent federal education statistics, 36,135 first-time freshmen students left New Jersey and 5,268 came to the state. That’s a net loss of 30,867. And when narrowing the data to freshmen who graduated in the past 12 months or students attending four-year institutions, the net loss is still more than 27,000 students. Cole’s on the mark with this statement. We rate it True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Susan Cole	None	None	None	2012-03-22T07:30:00	2012-03-13	['New_Jersey']
pomt-03410	"Seventy-four percent of Rhode Islanders support [a] national popular vote [for president] because they, as I, believe in one person-one vote."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/jun/30/raymond-gallison/ri-rep-raymond-gallison-says-74-percent-rhode-isla/	Should we change the way we pick our president? That was the issue June 13, 2013, when the Rhode Island House of Representatives debated a proposal that would give all four of the state's electoral votes to whomever won the popular vote nationwide in a presidential election, regardless of whether the majority of Rhode Islanders voted for that candidate. The change is designed to bypass the Electoral College system, which encourages candidates to devote the vast majority of their energy to swing states, where the race is close. States like Rhode Island, where the Democratic candidate typically wins, are ignored. The proposal would not take effect until enough states -- enough to represent a majority of all electoral votes -- agree to the plan. Both the House and Senate have passed comparable versions of the bill but they have to agree on at least one chamber's version before it can go to the governor. During the House debate, Rep. Raymond Gallison, a Democrat from Bristol, asserted that the "National Popular Vote" initiative has widespread support in Rhode Island. "Seventy four percent of Rhode Islanders support [a] national popular vote [for president] because they, as I, believe in one person, one vote," Gallison said. Getting 74 percent of Rhode Islanders to agree on anything controversial would be an accomplishment. But because we had never heard of a poll -- recent or otherwise -- on the issue, we asked Gallison for his source. He told us he would get back to us. Meanwhile, we checked around. We could find only one poll where Rhode Islanders were asked about the topic. It was on the website of National Popular Vote Inc., a "social welfare" nonprofit, tax-exempt organization that paid for the survey. The poll was conducted by Public Policy Polling, a Democratic-leaning survey firm based in North Carolina. Democrats tend to favor popular vote proposals. The question: "There is a proposal to change the way we elect the President. The current system elects a President based on the state-by-state vote totals. The new proposal would switch to a system that elects the President according to the vote totals in all 50 states. Would you generally support or oppose switching to a system that counts the votes in all 50 states combined?" As Gallison reported, 74 percent who responded supported electing the President by a purely popular vote. The margin of error was plus/minus 3.5 percent. But there are a few things to note. The poll was done five years ago. Nobody was interviewed for the survey. The data from 800 registered Rhode Island voters were collected by robocalls, where people hear a recorded message and are asked to respond by pressing a button on their telephone. That means a lot of people were hanging up without answering. Jim Williams, a polling analyst with Public Policy Polling, which did the survey, said about 9 out of every 10 people called typically hang up without answering a question. Perhaps most important, there was no ability for residents to indicate that they were undecided or didn't care. They had two choices: "support" or "oppose." Historically, 12 to 15 percent of the population has had no opinion on the subject, according to older Gallup surveys listed on National Popular Vote's website. Patrick Rosenstiel, spokesman for National Popular Vote, said the survey was designed to force a choice. "We didn't offer an 'undecided' or 'don't know' because a legislator, when the bill comes before them, can't be undecided. They've got to vote green or vote red," he said. The difference is that legislators have time to gather the facts, pro or con, before they are expected to make a choice. The poll offered no such guidance. When Gallison got back to us, he told us that his information came from that 2008 survey. We found a more recent Gallup poll on the question, conducted in October 2011. It posed the question in a way to help ensure that the wording did not affect the outcome and it allowed "undecided" as an option. In that survey, 62 percent supported a national popular vote and 35 percent endorsed keeping the Electoral College system. The rest were undecided. (The margin of error was plus/minus percentage points.) Sixty-two percent is a far cry from 74 percent. But that was a national survey, and Gallison was talking about Rhode Island. Rhode Islanders might feel differently because the Ocean State tends to be awash in Democrats, and Democrats favor the popular vote option. When Gallup only looked at the results for Democrats nationwide, the level of support was 71 percent. During his floor speech, Gallison said 74 percent of Rhode Islanders supported a popular vote because they believed in the concept of one person, one vote. Yet the automated survey didn't ask respondents to give a reason. When we asked Gallison about that, he said his statement was based on comments he had received from constituents who wanted him to vote in favor of the plan. Our ruling Rep. Raymond Gallison said, "Seventy four percent of Rhode Islanders support [a] national popular vote because they, as I, believe in one person, one vote." In the first half of his statement, he was correctly quoting a single five-year-old robocall poll from a special interest group in which respondents only had two options to choose from. Those who didn't know or didn't care either had to either pick an answer -- without the ability to hear arguments pro or con -- or just hang up, as most people do with such surveys. Nonetheless, other surveys have shown a high level of support for a national popular vote, even if it's not quite as high as the percentage quoted by Gallison. The second half of his statement implied that Rhode Islanders had been polled about their reasons for supporting the proposal. But the 2008 survey -- the one Gallison relied on -- never even posed that question. We can think of a few other reasons (such as wanting to bring more campaign money into Rhode Island) why residents might want a national popular vote. Because his statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True.

pomt-07184	By advocating new requirements for voters to show ID cards at the polls, Republicans "want to literally drag us all the way back to Jim Crow laws."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/09/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-compares-gop-backed-votin/	Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla. -- the new chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee -- provoked controversy recently when she compared Republican efforts to heighten scrutiny of voters at the polls to Jim Crow laws -- the primary tool that supported segregation and white supremacy in the South between the 1880s and the 1960s. On June 5, 2011, Wasserman Schultz was interviewed by Roland Martin, an African American political commentator for CNN and the host of a weekly public-affairs show on the TV One cable network. Martin brought up the topic of voter-identification laws. Here’s a portion of their conversation. "Republicans are backing measures that will require photo identification and other types of things, including cutting the number of days for early voting," Martin said. "Republicans say it will cut down on voter fraud. Critics contend it's a step backwards, and it would discriminate against the poor, elderly, students, people with disabilities, and minorities. … Your home state – Gov. Rick Scott is leading one of these efforts, and for the life of me, I don't understand whenever I see Republicans or even Democrats contesting votes and things along those lines. We talk about this is the fundamental right to be Americans, but to put roadblocks up to – to – for voting makes no sense to me." Wasserman Schultz responded, "Well, I mean if you go back to the year 2000, when we had an obvious disaster and – and saw that our voting process needed refinement, and we did that in (the Help America Vote Act) and made sure that we could iron out those kinks -- now you have the Republicans, who want to literally drag us all the way back to Jim Crow laws and literally – and very transparently – block access to the polls to voters who are more likely to vote for Democratic candidates than Republican candidates. And it's nothing short of that blatant." She went on to say that the DNC considers photo ID laws to be "very similar to a poll tax. I mean you look – just look at African-American voters as a snapshot. About 25 percent of African-American voters don't have a valid photo ID. I mean – and – and the reason it's similar to a poll tax is because you've got the expense. You've got the effort. There's difficulties for … many people in getting a photo ID. So, you're literally just throwing a barrier in the way of someone who's trying to exercise their right to vote." Wasserman Schultz continued, "And the reason that it's not necessary is because we already have very legitimate voter verification processes, signature checks that are already in place; and there is so little voter fraud, which is the professed reason the Republicans are advancing these – these laws. There's so little voter fraud, and I mean you're more likely to get hit by lightning than you are to see an instance of voter fraud in this country, but Republicans are imposing laws all over the country, acting like it's not – voter fraud is rampant, and it's ridiculous." Not long after the interview, Republicans pounced on the Jim Crow comparison, arguing that comparing voter ID laws to poll taxes, literacy tests and other Jim Crow laws was not only inaccurate from a policy perspective but was tantamount to calling the GOP racist. Later that day, Wasserman Schultz acknowledged that she had gone too far in her terminology, though she reiterated her opposition to the Republican-backed voter law policies. "Jim Crow was the wrong analogy to use," Wasserman Schultz said. "But I don't regret calling attention to the efforts in a number of states with Republican dominated legislatures, including Florida, to restrict access to the ballot box for all kinds of voters, but particularly young voters, African Americans and Hispanic Americans." In addition to voter ID laws, she and her allies have also criticized proposals that would restrict early voting and place burdens on registration drives. At PolitiFact, we do not typically fact-check statements that are quickly retracted by the speaker. However, we made an exception in this case because we expect voter identification laws and other election-process issues to remain a significant and divisive issue in the 2012 election. For this reason, we thought a historical comparison of Jim Crow laws and today’s voter-identification laws would be of interest to readers (and to us). At this time, we won’t delve deeply into the policy details of the current legislative proposals. Instead, we’re going to focus on the big-picture similarities and differences with Jim Crow laws. To do this, we reached out to about a dozen scholars and found a striking array of opinions, many of them passionate. Some -- many of them historians of the Jim Crow era -- believed that the comparison was justified. Others -- many of them election-law experts -- argued that the comparison was over the top. First, here’s the case for arguing that the current crop of voter laws are similar to Jim Crow laws. • Voting restrictions were the linchpin of Jim Crow. Preventing blacks from voting enabled the subsequent imposition of other segregationist laws. "Exclusion from the franchise was the centerpiece of the system that was put in place in the late 19th century," said Robert Korstad, a Duke University historian and coauthor of Remembering Jim Crow: African Americans Tell About Life in the Segregated South. • Like Jim Crow laws, the new laws are likely to diminish the voter pool. Though the extent is uncertain, most experts agree that some people who would otherwise want to vote will be disenfranchised. And many agree that minorities will be hit disproportionately. The United States is unusual among advanced industrialized countries in promulgating an "enormous discouragement of voting," said Glenda Gilmore, a Yale University professor of history, American Studies and African American Studies and coauthor of Jumpin’ Jim Crow. "Historians of the South use the term ‘Jim Crow laws’ to mean discouraging voting in a way that impacts minority voters. So, I think that she was exactly right in her use of the phrase." In fact, some of the potential legal challenges to today’s new laws will argue they violate the 24th Amendment’s prohibition against the poll tax. • Allegations of fraud were also used to support the initial imposition of Jim Crow voting laws. Jane Dailey, a historian at the University of Chicago and author of Gender and Jim Crow: Women and the Politics of White Supremacy in North Carolina, 1896-1920, agrees that Wasserman Schultz’s comparison "is historically accurate," in part because the justifications were the same. "Groups interested in limiting political competition have always justified suffrage restrictions as necessary checks on election fraud," Dailey said. "Like today's GOP, turn-of-the-century southern Democrats argued that poll taxes and literacy tests would reduce fraud at the polls." • Even laws that are superficially race-neutral can have serious effects on minorities. Many of the Jim Crow voting laws were not explicitly written to favor white voters over black voters, even though they had that practical effect. "There was nothing, on the surface, that made those laws anti-black. It was how they were enforced that became critical," said William H. Chafe, a Duke University historian and coauthor with Korstad of Remembering Jim Crow: African Americans Tell About Life in the Segregated South. "The laws provided political officials with the tools to discriminate against whom they wished." Now, we’ll present the case for arguing that the current crop of voter laws are different from Jim Crow laws. • Jim Crow laws had much higher rates of disenfranchisement. Jim Crow laws disenfranchised all or virtually all of the potential black voters in southern states. Not even critics suggest that will happen today with voter ID laws. "Black voter participation, which in some places had been 90 percent of eligible male voters in the late 1860s and early 1870s, was cut to essentially zero by early decades of 20th century," said Michael J. Klarman, a professor at Harvard Law School and the author of From Jim Crow to Civil Rights: The Supreme Court and the Struggle for Racial Equality. "What Republicans are doing now … is trivial by comparison. They are making it marginally harder for poor people, disproportionately minority, to vote." • It’s much easier for minorities to abide by a voter ID law than a Jim Crow law. Getting an identification card may be a hassle, but it’s not as challenging as learning how to read. "Unlike with Jim Crow laws, there are ways voters can avoid this loss of voting rights," said Rob Richie, the executive director of FairVote, a non-partisan group that works to expand voter turnout and improve how elections are run. Thomas Adams Upchurch -- a historian at East Georgia College and author of several works on race relations in the South, including Legislating Racism: The Billion Dollar Congress and the Birth of Jim Crow-- agreed, saying that "people find the money to afford those things that are important to them, and they make a way to do those things that they value. If people want to vote, they should have a photo ID." • Jim Crow was about much more than just voter disenfranchisement. While laws to restrict voting were an important part of the system of Jim Crow, they were just one part, said James C. Cobb, a University of Georgia historian and author of several books on the South, including The Brown Decision, Jim Crow, And Southern Identity. Legalized discrimination in the South ran the gamut from separate hotels and buses to to unequal schools to separate water fountains. Today, invoking the term Jim Crow in a policy debate seems like an unnecessarily broad -- not to mention provocative -- way for Wasserman Schultz to make her case against voter ID laws. "Jim Crow regimes involved relentless efforts to stop all African Americans from voting and included brutal intimidation tactics, like lynching," said Heather Gerken, a Yale Law School professor who specializes in election law. "I don’t think photo ID rises to that level, and I don’t think she thinks so either." • Jim Crow was unadulterated racism. Voter ID laws are not. Richard Hasen, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles and a specialist in election law, said that intent matters. "Jim Crow laws were intended to hurt African-Americans and make it difficult for them to achieve any political strength," Hasen said. "In contrast, the motives behind the wave of Republican-led voter identification laws and other restrictive voting laws are less clear. At their worst, the laws seem to be motivated to hurt Democrats, including poor and minority voters who tend to vote Democratic," which would make it "partisan, not racial, discrimination." Gerken agreed that there’s a difference between what’s intended to do harm and what might do harm as a side effect. "Photo ID laws are the product of good motives (a desire to prevent fraud) and bad motives (an effort to use election regulations to promote the election chances of the GOP)," Gerken said. "The congresswoman is quite right to worry if they have a disparate effect on African Americans, precisely because they continue to suffer from the continuing effects of past discrimination. But the purpose is quite different. Jim Crow was motivated by pure racial animus. Here, the dominant motive is politics." It’s true that Wasserman Schultz isn’t the only one who’s made the Jim Crow comparison. Editorials in the New York Times, the Miami Herald, the Memphis Commercial Appeal, the Amarillo Globe News have all referenced Jim Crow laws in this context, as have a smattering of politicians. Still, we agree with her ultimate decision to retract her use of the phrase. Even if the ultimate effect of these laws is to decrease voter turnout -- and even if the need to prevent voter fraud is not as dire as the laws’ supporters contend -- Wasserman Schultz’s decision to compare the new crop of laws to Jim Crow went too far. Although there are some similarities in the two sets of laws, they are outweighed both by the differences between them and by the inflammatory nature of the phrase, which all but calls the laws’ supporters racists. The current laws would at worst disenfranchise a fraction of minority voters, not most of them. Unlike with Jim Crow laws, minority voters allow an feasible "out" -- getting an ID card. Wasserman Schultz’s comparison reduces an overwhelming apartheid system to one of its facets, voting laws. And Jim Crow was pure racism, whereas the intent behind today’s proposals is, at most, partisan gain -- albeit at the expense of some would-be voters, many of whom are likely to be minorities. Reasonable people can disagree about the wisdom of the new laws, but they would not return the United States to Jim Crow. Saying so offers more heat than light. On balance, we rate her comment False.

pomt-05328	On abortion	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/15/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-evolved-significantly-his-position-abo/	UPDATE: This article has been changed to reflect that the issues section of Romney's campaign website does address abortion, under the heading "Values." Our ruling remains the same. Mitt Romney has faced years of accusations that he’s flip-flopped on various issues. One issue where Romney has clearly changed his position is abortion. We should note that the Flip-O-Meter rates politicians' consistency on particular topics from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on their decisions to change their minds. It’s simply gauging whether they did. First, we’ll look at some of the things Romney said earlier in his career about abortion, when he was waging a losing bid for a U.S. Senate seat in Massachusetts and winning the governorship a few years later. Here are two of the clearest statements of his position. • In a debate during his 1994 race against Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy, Romney said, "I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country." Referring to the 1973 Supreme Court decision that made abortion legal in every state, Romney added, "I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years, it should be sustained and supported. And I sustain and support that law and support the right of a woman to make that choice." • In his 2002 campaign for governor, Romney said during a debate, "I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard." We believe that these two comments -- made in highly public forums and eight years apart -- represent pretty solid evidence that Romney was an abortion-rights supporter during that phase of his political career. (A few other media sources that provide a detailed accounting of the nuances of Romney’s abortion views can be found here and here.) What about Romney’s views today? Romney wrote a June 18, 2011, op-ed in the conservative National Review that lays out his abortion views in detail. "I am pro-life and believe that abortion should be limited to only instances of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. I support the reversal of Roe v. Wade, because it is bad law and bad medicine. Roe was a misguided ruling that was a result of a small group of activist federal judges legislating from the bench. I support the Hyde Amendment, which broadly bars the use of federal funds for abortions. And as president, I will support efforts to prohibit federal funding for any organization like Planned Parenthood, which primarily performs abortions or offers abortion-related services. "I will reinstate the Mexico City Policy to ensure that nongovernmental organizations that receive funding from America refrain from performing or promoting abortion services as a method of family planning, in other countries. This includes ending American funding for any United Nations or other foreign assistance program that promotes or performs abortions on women around the world. "I will advocate for and support a Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act to protect unborn children who are capable of feeling pain from abortion. And perhaps most importantly, I will only appoint judges who adhere to the Constitution and the laws as they are written, not as they want them to be written." Romney repeated strong anti-abortion views throughout the 2012 presidential primaries. For instance, during a town meeting in Hopkinton, N.H., on Oct. 10, 2011, Romney answered a question about his position on abortion this way: "What I would like to see happen would be for the Supreme Court to say, look, we’re going to overturn Roe v. Wade and return to the states the authority to decide whether they want to have abortion or not, state by state. That’s the way it was before Roe v. Wade. So I am firmly pro-life." And on his campaign website, Romney said he "believes that life begins at conception and wishes that the laws of our nation reflected that view. But while the nation remains so divided, he believes that the right next step is for the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade – a case of blatant judicial activism that took a decision that should be left to the people and placed it in the hands of unelected judges. With Roe overturned, states will be empowered through the democratic process to determine their own abortion laws and not have them dictated by judicial mandate." It’s also worth noting that Romney has not denied a change of heart on abortion. He traces it to a statehouse meeting with Harvard University stem-cell researcher Douglas Melton on Nov. 9, 2004. By Romney’s account, he was stunned to hear Melton say that "we kill the embryos after 14 days." (Two years after the meeting, Melton sharply contradicted that account, telling the Boston Globe that Romney "mischaracterized" his position and saying that he and Romney "didn't discuss killing or anything related to it. I explained my work to him, told him about my deeply held respect for life, and explained that my work focuses on improving the lives of those suffering from debilitating diseases." An exhaustive journalistic review of Romney’s stances on abortion by Slate’s William Saletan, however, suggests that Romney’s view of what transpired in the meeting is plausible.) In an interview with the conservative blog RedState in September 2006, Romney said, "My position changed during the stem-cell research debate. The provost of Harvard and the head of stem-cell research came into my office and at one point said that stem-cell research was not a moral issue because they killed the embryo at 14 days. And it hit me hard at that very moment that the Roe v. Wade philosophy had cheapened the value of human life. And I said to my chief of staff, who was with me in the meeting, as we came outside, ‘I am no longer content with the description of my position. I want to call myself pro-life.’ " Our ruling Romney’s views on abortion are significantly different today than what he expressed in the 1994 and 2002 debates. Indeed, Romney has acknowledged that his views on abortion have changed over the years. His shift in position on abortion rates a Full Flop.

pomt-05398	Says she is co-owner of Celilo Group Media.	true	/oregon/statements/2012/may/05/eileen-brady/eileen-brady-co-owner-celilo-group-media/	In this election, Eileen Brady has been tested up and down on claims that she helped found the popular New Seasons market chain way back when. We’re not touching that here. Instead, we turn to another ownership claim by Brady. In last week’s televised mayoral debate, she was introduced as board chair and co-owner of Celilo Group Media. The company publishes and distributes coupon books, including the popular Chinook Book. Company president Nik Blosser said that he doesn’t use the co-owner term. But he confirmed that Brady is the third largest individual who is a shareholder in the company. He and co-founder Tom Koehler invited Brady to join their board nearly a decade ago, and she has been chairwoman since. "So she has and has had a key leadership role in the company, and she's an investor herself," Blosser said. Who are we to argue with that? Brady’s claim is accurate. We rule the statement True.

pomt-06077	"We're only inches away from no longer being a free economy."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/08/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-once-again-says-us-inches-away-no-long/	Mitt Romney continues to repeat the talking point that the United States is "only inches away from no longer being a free economy." But we’ve ruled it Pants on Fire twice-- and now he's achieved a PolitiFact hat trick. During the Jan. 7, 2012, Republican presidential debate in Manchester, N.H., former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney once again stated, "We're only inches away from no longer being a free economy." Previously, Romney had said essentially the same thing during a Republican presidential debate in Ames, Iowa, on Aug. 11, 2011, and in his June 2, 2011, presidential announcement at a farm in Stratham, N.H. As we indicated when we first checked this claim in June, we at PolitiFact tolerate a bit of hyperbole from politicians on all sides when they’re trying to make a point. So we’re not literally using a ruler to measure distances here. However, we decided that the underlying question -- whether the United States could really be approaching socialism -- is a fair one to analyze. Here are some of the statistics to consider: Government spending On the suggestion of several economists, we took the figures for government expenditures (which includes all levels of government) and divided them by the national gross domestic product for the years 1996 through 2010. For more than a decade, government spending as a percentage of GDP was quite stable, bouncing between 30.4 percent and 32.9 percent. For the last few years, that percentage has indeed gone up -- to roughly 38 percent in both 2009 and 2010, which is within striking distance of the 40 percent Romney cited. Bruce Bartlett, a former official in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, told us at the time that Romney is "implying that the temporary increase in spending from (Obama’s stimulus bill) and the consequences of the recession are permanent," Bartlett said. Other economists noted that government’s footprint in GDP started growing in 2008 -- under Bush, not Obama -- because that’s when the recession began to hit. And even if the government share of GDP is close to 40 percent, would that be a catastrophe for economic freedom? Most of the experts we spoke to scoffed at the suggestion. "It has long been the conservative view that there is only so much freedom out there and if government grows in size then this necessarily diminishes freedom," Bartlett said. "Thus if spending is 25 percent of GDP, then we are three-quarters free, and if it grows to 40 percent, then we have lost 15 percent of our freedom and are only 60 percent free. This, of course, is nonsense, because it implies that the greatest freedom exists in anarchy … and that freedom is the only thing anyone cares about." Here are a few other statistics to consider. Taxes Taxes offer another measure of government involvement into the economy. According to the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that studies tax policy, the total federal, state and local tax burden has been falling -- not rising -- in recent years. Every year, the group computes a national figure for all levels of taxation as a share of national income. The data shows that the tax burden has fallen modestly in recent years, from 31.2 percent in 2006 to 27.2 percent in 2011. And as we concluded in a separate fact-check, the U.S. tax burden isn’t just hovering around a historical low -- it’s also low compared to other advanced industrialized nations. In a 2006 international comparison, 25 nations had a higher percentage of taxes compared to GDP than the U.S., while just four -- Mexico, Japan, Korea and Turkey -- had a lower percentage. Regulation "One loses being a free market economy not so much, or not solely, because of the level of spending and taxation, but also by the level and reach of government regulation, and by the distortions to choices that arise through government policy -- think of tax rules that discourage some behaviors and investments in favor of others," said J.D. Foster, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation. Tevi Troy, a senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute, said that bailouts for Wall Street and U.S. automakers (approved under Bush and continued under Obama) and the increasing government oversight over the health care sector (approved under Obama) represent nearly unprecedented willingness by the government to intervene in the economy. (Supporters, of course, counter that all but the health care intervention were intended to be temporary and came in response to a dire situation.) However, there’s strong evidence undercutting Romney's claim that comes from, of all places, the conservative Heritage Foundation. Heritage published an economic freedom index for 2011-- an international ranking of nations using a combination of 10 types of statistics, covering business freedom, trade freedom, fiscal freedom, government spending, monetary freedom, investment freedom, financial freedom, property rights, freedom from corruption and labor freedom. Certainly, different groups could measure freedom differently. But let’s look at what Heritage concluded. The U.S. ranked ninth out of 179 nations on the list, with a score that placed it near the top of the "mostly free" category. The only nations to be considered more "free" than the U.S. were, in descending order, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Canada, Ireland, and Denmark. If the results of this study -- which, we’ll remind readers, was produced by a staunchly conservative think tank -- suggest that the U.S. is on the verge of socialism, then Lenin must be partying in his mauseoleum. For the U.S. to fall into the "mostly unfree" category, which is only the third-lowest category in the study, it would have to drop a whopping 83 slots, to a perch below such nations as Albania, Rwanda and Kazakhstan. We did hear one argument that provided a measure of support for Romney’s position -- but only in a backhanded way. Eugene Steuerle, an economist with the Urban Institute, a think tank that does economic and social policy research, said Romney’s comparison is imperfect because over the past century, there really hasn’t been a golden age in which the economy was genuinely unfettered, so the U.S. really couldn't be inching away from such an age. "We’ve been a mixed economy for a long time," Steuerle said. "The ‘free market’ is a somewhat vague term. Technically, a Federal Reserve system and an antitrust division of the Justice Department interfere with a totally free market economy, yet they may promote a competitive economy." Our ruling It’s true that the government’s footprint on spending has grown over the past few years, due in large part to the recession. But while the statistics show that the government continues to have a large influence on the economy, there is little indication that the government’s role has risen dramatically enough over the past few years to threaten the kind of free market that the U.S. has operated under in recent decades. And international comparisons show that the U.S. ranks low in both total tax burden and high in economic freedom -- at least as measured by a prominent conservative think tank. Last June and August, we found this claim to merit a Pants on Fire. Nothing has changed our view. We rate Romney's statement Pants on Fire. EDITOR’S NOTE: The quote we used from Tevi Troy was made on June 2, 2011. After this article was published, we learned that Troy subsequently joined the Romney campaign as an adviser, according to POLITICO.

pomt-01630	Each Georgia taxpayer would have to send $5,000 to the treasury to cover the state’s debt.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2014/aug/27/truth-accounting/georgias-finances-not-alarming-report-suggests/	Outside rankings of Georgia have fueled the fire of some of this year’s political campaigns. Republican Gov. Nathan Deal has boasted that both the little-known magazine Site Selection and media heavyweight CNBC have deemed Georgia the top place in the nation to do business. Democratic challenger Jason Carter questioned the political mileage of the rankings, saying they mask other problems such as an unemployment rate that ranks 50th out of 50 states and the District of Columbia. Now the nonpartisan think tank Truth in Accounting in Chicago has released a study blasting Georgia for carrying a nearly $16 billion debt burden, mostly from unfunded pension and retiree health care liabilities. It ranks Georgia’s financial condition as the 28th worst among all states. "In order to fill this financial hole, each Georgia taxpayer would have to send $5,000 to the state’s treasury," according to a summary of the study. Who has that kind of coin lying around? PolitiFact Georgia sure doesn’t. But how is it the state have both a balanced budget requirement and that kind of debt? Sheila Weinberg, the certified public accountant who founded TIA, thinks the problem lies with Georgia (and other states) not including long-term pension and retiree health care compensation in the annual budget. Georgia’s audited financial report shows $2 billion in retirement benefits. But Weinberg claims by adding in those other compensations, the state has more than $14 billion of unfunded retirement programs over the next three decades. Every state has that kind of long-term obligation. Now, those unfunded liabilities are in the footnotes of the financial statements filed yearly. The Government Accounting Standards board, though, is changing those accounting rules. Pension liabilities will be on the balance sheets starting with the 2014 reports. If Georgia followed those standards this year, the state Employees Retirement System, or ERS, would show a $4.8 billion unfunded liability. But those rules affect only how those debts are reported. It doesn’t change their totals or decide the policies on funding them. In Georgia, pension funding is governed by state law, which requires an actuary to calculate the annual required minimum contribution to meet the long-term obligation. As of 2013, Georgia also adds extra cash to that minimum, amortized over 25 years, to fill the gap. The state sets aside that money first, before determining the rest of the budget. It has never failed to do so. The ERS – which covers 60,000 active members and 45,000 retirees – was 71.4 percent funded in 2013. That puts it just shy of the 72 percent average for the nation’s largest pension funds and among those funds considered well-funded for the future, according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. "Our contributions come in like clockwork every year," said Jim Potvin, the ERS’ executive director. "The support has come from multiple administrations literally spanning decades." But if pension costs are obligated, retiree healthcare costs are optional. The TIA study projects the retiree health care liability at $7.4 billion. It would require changes to state law – most likely to reduce benefits – to lower that cost. Alan Essig, executive director of the left-leaning Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, said such changes are far more likely than the option of tax hikes in our fiscally conservative state. "It’s not as if we have to pay tomorrow," Essig said. "We have 30 years to plan budgetarily and change policy to meet our obligations." In other words, Georgia has never missed its obligations on retiree health care or pension, and there is no reason to expect that will change anytime soon. And, since no one expects Georgia taxpayers to march downtown and make a lump sum payment, the report’s calculations strike some as a silly exercise. There is value in discussing the obligations, said Alicia H. Munnell, the executive director of the Center for Retirement Research. But a more useful exercise would be to have a separate discussion about ways to pay the debt long-term. Georgia, Munnell said, has already had many of those discussions that resulted in the existing laws and policies that have it on the right financial track. "The whole report has this alarmist tone, as if they’ve discovered something new," Munnell said. "Really, Georgia should be proud of itself for being fairly prudently managed to pay off its debts." So, that $5,000 bill facing Georgia taxpayers? It’s a great way to get us to pay attention to the promises we’ve made with public dollars. The statement suggests that the state is being reckless, or that a one-time payment is coming soon. That is not the case. Georgia has been thoughtful about its looming obligations and positioned itself to pay down those debts over time. For that reason, we rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-02261	When Republicans last controlled the presidency and Congress, "the number of people on food stamps (and) the number of people in low-income housing went through the roof."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/apr/10/glenn-grothman/when-gop-last-ran-washington-rolls-food-stamps-sub/	State Sen. Glenn Grothman caused a commotion among fellow Republicans when he announced he would try to oust 35-year GOP congressman Tom Petri in the August 2014 primary election. A brash, self-proclaimed tea party conservative, Grothman contrasts with the more low-key Petri, whom the Daily Beast called "the last Rockefeller Republican on Capitol Hill." On April 4, 2014, the day after his announcement, Grothman was asked why he is running for the seat, which represents a district in eastern Wisconsin that is north of Milwaukee and Madison. He blamed Republicans. "Like a lot of people, I am frustrated with what’s going on in Washington. I’m not frustrated with the gridlock as much as frustrated with our national Republicans," Grothman told Jay Weber, a conservative radio talk show host on WISN-AM (1130) in Milwaukee. "I mean, in a lot of ways, I think the country is in deep trouble. And it’s not just a bad economy or the huge amount of debt. You have, I think, kind of social ills that have been encouraged by bad federal policies. And I’m thinking about the out-of-control entitlements that have led to a complete breakdown of the family and so many segments of society. "The Republicans, I don’t think, are doing enough to articulate the size of the problem," Grothman continued, before uttering the claim we decided to check. "And when the Republicans were last in control – from like 2001 to 2007, when they had the president, the House and the Senate – they really only made matters worse. During that time, the number of people on food stamps, the number of people in low-income housing went through the roof." So, let’s see if there was huge growth in food stamps and low-income housing during the period Grothman cites and, if so, whether the GOP was responsible. Party control As Grothman indicated, Republicans were mostly in control in Washington from 2001 to 2007, with George W. Bush in the White House and GOP majorities in the House. But in the Senate, Democrats held a 51-49 majority for about a year and a half during that period. The power shift occurred in June 2001 after Vermont Sen. James Jeffords left the GOP, became an independent and caucused with the Democrats. The 51-49 edge went back to the GOP in mid-November 2002 when Republican James Talent won a Senate seat in Missouri. Republicans maintained control through the 2005-’07 congressional session (Democrats retook the Senate in the 2007-’09 Congress.) Now to the two parts of Grothman’s claim. Food stamps U.S. Department of Agriculture figures show the average number of food stamp recipients increased in each year between 2001 and 2006, before edging downward in 2007. 2001: 17.3 million 2002: 19.1 million 2003: 21.3 million 2004: 23.8 million 2005: 25.6 million 2006: 26.5 million 2007: 26.3 million The number of people on food stamps was 52 percent higher in 2007 than it was in 2001. And that came after a six-year span, from 1995 to 2001, when the number of food stamp recipients declined by 35 percent. Changes in policy were important in the increase during the 2001-’07 period Grothman cited. In rating as True a claim that food stamp spending doubled under Bush and doubled again under President Barack Obama, PolitiFact National found that lawmakers in 2002 had rolled back some food stamp eligibility restrictions. And a Bush adviser told our colleagues the administration’s goal at the time was to expand food programs for low-income working families and make it easier for states to administer the program and get more eligible people signed up. Michael Tanner of the libertarian Cato Institute and Stacy Dean of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities told us the economy and Bush policies were factors. Tanner put more weight on the policies, while Dean cited both factors. So, there’s evidence to back the first part of Grothman’s claim. Low-income housing When we asked for evidence on the second part of the claim, Grothman admitted he didn’t have figures on the number of people living in low-income housing, but assumed the number had increased because more tax credits were made available to developers of low-income housing units. More specifically, Congress in 2001 increased by 40 percent -- from $1.25 to $1.75 per person -- and indexed to inflation a tax credit that states could allocate towards funding low-income housing. But Grothman’s statement was much broader than one specific program. He said that the number of people living in low-income housing -- not just those benefitting from one particular program -- was way up. So that’s how we’re evaluating that part of his claim. Figures from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development count the number of people living in all types of HUD-subsidized housing, including those in units built with low-income tax credits as well as in units covered by the rent-subsidy Section 8 program and other programs. The number rose from 8.49 million in 2000 to 9.39 million in 2007. The 2007 figure is 10.6 percent higher. That’s not a staggering increase, but it certainly is a significant one. Barbara Sard, vice president for housing policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said much of the increase was due to an increase in subsidized-housing vouchers authorized by Congress from 1999 to 2001 (when the GOP controlled both chambers and Democrat Bill Clinton was president). The Cato Institute’s Mark Calabria, a staff member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs during about half the period Grothman cited, noted the tax credit expansion that Grothman cited. He also said the Bush administration added more housing vouchers and congressional Republicans didn’t move to curtail spending on housing assistance. Our rating Grothman said that when Republicans last controlled the presidency and Congress, from roughly 2001 to 2007, "the number of people on food stamps (and) the number of people in low-income housing went through the roof." After having declined for a number of years, the number of people receiving food stamps increased 52 percent during the period, as the Bush administration and Congress widened eligibility and encouraged more eligible people to apply. The increase in people living in low-income housing was more modest, but still significant. We rate Grothman’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-03625	Says state’s mandated tests come from an English company.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/may/06/george-lavender/george-lavender-says-english-company-supplies-texa/	During a legislative session marked by backlash against state-mandated testing, Rep. George Lavender offered an amendment to drop some Texas exams for an Iowa alternative. "I think we need to get at least an American company doing our tests instead of an English company," the Texarkana Republican said April 29, 2013, during debate on a House bill to cut and shorten some tests given under the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness. The bill won House approval, but without Lavender’s amendment to substitute the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills for certain STAAR exams, which was tabled. Does an English company provide Texas’ tests? Since September 1981, according to histories of Texas testing on the education agency’s website, the state’s primary contractor for statewide assessment programs has been the same: the company known today as NCS Pearson, Inc. By phone, Lavender told us, "I know they have a lot of employees in Texas and I know they have a lot of employees worldwide, but the fact is that they’re a British company, and I would much prefer a U.S.-based company to be doing our testing." The Texas program isn’t functioning as intended, he said, and there are other tests that "have been proven to work across the country." Susan Aspey, vice president of public affairs for New York-based Pearson North America, told us by phone, "Pearson PLC is the parent company. It is based in the U.K. Pearson’s North American education businesses are based here in North America. Pearson’s testing businesses are based in Minnesota. In the state of Texas, Pearson employs 1,800 people." Specifically, NCS Pearson is incorporated in Minnesota, she said. Corporate websites and profiles from Bloomberg Businessweek show the company is headquartered in Bloomington, Minn., and was founded in 1962 as National Computer Systems to score psychology diagnostic tests; the name changed to NCS Pearson in 2000 when it was bought by U.K. company Pearson PLC. Pearson PLC today is a global education services company headquartered at 80 Strand in London that also owns book publisher Penguin and the Financial Times news organization. It listed 42,980 employees in its 2012 annual report, including 18,552 in "North American education" and 16,751 in "international education." Aspey said, "Pearson employs three times as many people in the U.S. as it does in the U.K." Under NCS Pearson’s 2010-2015 contract with Texas’ schools agency, the company will be paid $468 million for STAAR and Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) tests and services. Two of the largest subcontracted amounts were listed as going to online learning company Desire2Learn, based in Canada, and Chicago-based communications firm RR Donnelley. And who writes the STAAR tests? Three subcontractors plus Texas educators, agency spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe told us by email. Items for the test are drafted, she said, by the San Antonio-based K-12 Education Division of a global, private organization, the Princeton, N.J.-headquartered nonprofit Educational Testing Service, and two companies named Lone Star and Tri-Lin Integrated Services. Then they’re edited by the agency and committees of Texas educators, Ratcliffe said. Our ruling Lavender said the state’s mandatory tests come from an English company. Pearson, the parent company of Texas’ testing contractor, is English. Then again, NCS Pearson is incorporated in Minnesota and was American-owned until 2000. Also, test items are generated by subcontractors including the San Antonio division of a global organization headquartered in New Jersey. Lacking these clarifications, the statement rates as Mostly True.	None	George Lavender	None	None	None	2013-05-06T10:34:54	2013-04-29	['England']
pomt-03752	Says that his transportation budget and Ohio Turnpike plan "would make sure we have lower tolls than we’ve had through the history of the turnpike."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2013/apr/08/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-says-his-turnpike-plan-would-lower/	After some tinkering by the General Assembly, Gov. John Kasich on April 1 signed into law a two-year transportation budget that charts a new future for the state-owned Ohio Turnpike. Kasich’s signature -- and his line-item veto of an annual reimbursement to railroad operators -- ended months of debate and speculation about what would make the final version. Despite early talk of privatization, the turnpike will remain a public asset. The bill also raises the speed limit to 70 mph on rural highways and aims to raise billions of dollars for road projects. But questions remain, and that brings us to Kasich’s recent appearance on "State of Ohio," a weekly program produced by Cleveland’s WVIZ ideastream and its Statehouse News Bureau. During an interview, the Republican governor told host Karen Kasler that his proposal "would make sure we have lower tolls than we’ve had through the history of the turnpike." The claim caught our ear because the plan, as has been reported by The Plain Dealer and others, calls for tolls to increase for at least 10 years. Was Kasich taking us out for a spin? PolitiFact Ohio decided to find out how the Truth-O-Meter tolls. Kasich taped the interview March 20, the same day the Senate approved a conference committee report that shaped the final version of his transportation budget. The House approved the report a day later. The bill did not change between March 20 and the April 1 signing. So let’s examine the crux of Kasich’s turnpike plan. The bill approved by the legislature allows the state, for the first time, to use revenue from the Ohio Turnpike for projects beyond the 241-mile toll road. By raising tolls in each of the next 10 years, Ohio can issue $1.5 billion in bonds to help pay for transportation initiatives that might have been delayed a decade or longer. Kasich hopes to leverage that bond money into an equal amount of federal and local cash, creating a $3 billion pot for roads and bridges in coming years. The new law requires that 90 percent of the money be spent within 75 miles of the turnpike. The governor projects the work will support 65,000 jobs. And he hinted April 1 that Opportunity Corridor, a long-planned link from Interstate 490 through Cleveland to University Circle, might benefit. So what about those "lower tolls" Kasich mentioned in his TV interview? Here’s where it gets complicated. If you have an E-ZPass, the bill freezes your tolls for the next 10 years on trips of 30 miles or less. But that only applies to passenger cars -- not commercial trucks. For all others, the intention is to raise tolls at no more than the rate of inflation. Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols cited these stipulations when PolitiFact Ohio asked about the governor’s remarks. Over 20 years, tolls have risen "almost three times the rate of inflation for cars," Nichols said, attributing the figure to a state-commissioned turnpike analysis. The 2012 report from KPMG Corporate Finance LLC found that between 1993 and 2012, the rolling average increase in Ohio toll rates per mile was 7.2 percent for passenger cars. "The increase in toll rates outpaced the average annual growth of CPI [the Consumer Price Index], which was 2.5% over the same time period," the KPMG report states. KPMG now estimates annual CPI growth for the Midwest at 2.7 percent. Essentially, the Kasich administration intends to follow this inflation measure when capping future increases. But "intends" is a key word here. Kasich did not favor writing the cap into law and lawmakers tabled an amendment that would have done so. Nichols said such language makes bond lawyers nervous. The bill also allows the state to lift the 10-year freeze on local E-ZPass tolls if "necessary to comply with covenants in bond proceedings in existence before July 1, 2013." Despite bond market concerns, the Turnpike Commission is expected to commit to the inflation cap in a resolution that will be introduced at a meeting this week, Nichols said. While that would have less authority than legislation, Nichols accurately noted that any future governor, General Assembly or turnpike regime could undo any of the Kasich administration’s measures. One last fact to consider. The 10-year freeze on short E-ZPass trips is not likely to benefit many turnpike motorists -- at least not to start. Only about 30 percent of the turnpike’s passenger car transactions come through the electronic payment system, according to KPMG. Kasich said his plan would "make sure we have lower tolls than we had through the history of that turnpike." Yes, the bill aims to keep tolls from rising faster than the pace of inflation -- a practice that would stand in contrast to KPMG’s findings from the past 20 years. And, yes, the bill freezes tolls for 10 years on a small, targeted cross-section of turnpike users. But not only are higher tolls a part of Kasich’s plan, they are integral to the concept. The increased revenue will allow the state to issue bonds to finance other projects. Furthermore, the inflation cap is not written into the law, and the state has an out from the local EZ-Pass freeze. Ohio Turnpike drivers might be getting a better deal than they were before. But future tolls that do not climb as quickly as they might have in the past are not lower tolls. It’s not only misleading but ridiculous for Kasich to portray it that way.

pomt-12096	Says Rick Kriseman is $35 million over budget on St. Petersburg’s new police station.	false	/florida/statements/2017/aug/25/rick-baker/former-mayor-rick-baker-wrongly-says-new-police-he/	All summer long, Rick Baker has hammered opponent and current Mayor Rick Kriseman over what he sees as exorbitant spending on the new pier and new police station. In a Tampa Bay Times article on June 14, Baker said: "To me it's all about quality of life. Whether it's dog parks, skate board parks, rec centers ... And the trouble is, if you're $35 million over budget on the Pier and $35 million over budget on a police station, it's very hard to do that stuff." Kriseman, on the other hand, argued the police station is under budget and ahead of schedule — a premature statement that we rated Mostly False. Here, we wanted to test Baker’s claim that the city is over budget on the police station. Two stations, two estimates Plans for a new police station have been in the works since Baker was mayor more than a decade ago. The city’s police building on 1300 First Ave. N. was built in multiple phases, with the first part unveiled in 1951 and the other in 1978. Baker argues the current budget is way more than what was originally determined in 2006, when he was in his second term. The estimate to replace the police station came in at $50 million, according to the Tampa Bay Times. The latest price tag to replace the aging station is $86 million. That’s about $35 million higher than the 2006 estimate. Contrary to Baker’s point, the expected price hike does not prove dramatic cost overruns driven by the current mayor. Baker’s point essentially compares two different projects, holding Kriseman to an estimate that low-balled the expected costs and obviously pre-dated him. Most of the price hike happened before Kriseman took office The city knew years before Kriseman became mayor that it would take more than $50 million to replace police headquarters. In 2010, a consultant hired by the city unveiled a report detailing that St. Petersburg needed to spend $74 million to replace its police headquarters. Given the state of the economy, city officials knew the $74 million price tag was too steep. "I don't think we can afford this," said City Council member Karl Nurse in 2010. As the economic downturn set in, the city looked at other options, including building a scaled-down version while making updates to the old facility. However, after the economy picked back up, Kriseman announced in 2015 the city would have enough money to build a new station again for $70 million. After the budget was set at $70 million (a decision approved by the City Council 7-1), additional costs were added for parking, energy efficient features, and a new shooting range, bringing the final budget for new police facilities to $86 million. Here’s how the budget changed over the years: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com To Baker, this does not matter. "The bottom line is the budget was $50 million dollars for the police station, anything the department needed, should have been built into that initial $50 million dollar budget, period," said Rick Baker. "The fact that Kriseman is playing budgetary games does not hide the fact that, as documented by the Tampa Bay Times on multiple occasions, he is on a ‘spending binge,’ and is tens of millions of dollars over budget on the police station project." Budget adjustments are not synonymous with being over budget, though. The city is not yet anticipating to spend more than what the council approved. The city says it has spent $4 million towards the construction of the project, which started in late spring. Construction costs eat up the majority of the budget, at $61 million. The rest of the spending is for architecture, planning and other services related to the pre-development of the project. City officials estimated the project will be done in December 2018, and fully operational in spring 2019. Baker is not alone in criticizing the added features cooked into the final project. His staff highlighted how the Tampa Bay Times editorial board criticized Kriseman’s spending on the police station and pier. The editorial does not call the police project over budget. Our ruling Baker said that the new police headquarters is over budget. Baker considers the budget for the police department to be $50 million, which was the amount that was originally set aside in 2006 when he was mayor. However, before Kriseman took office, a consultant said the city would need $74 million to build a new police headquarters. With the addition of features such as a shooting range and a parking garage, the project’s expected cost is now $86 million. Baker’s insistence that Kriseman should have stuck to a budget developed 11 years ago ignores the changed expectations before Kriseman took office. Moreover, the city is not far enough along on the project to say that it is over budget. So far, there’s no indication that the city is spending more than what the council approved. Baker’s statement is inaccurate. We rate this claim False. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Rick Baker	None	None	None	2017-08-25T11:30:18	2017-06-14	['None']
pomt-12010	Says Ted Cruz is the "same senator who once supported a ban on sex toys."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2017/sep/21/new-york-post/mostly-false-ted-cruz-same-senator-who-once-suppor/	Among darts tossed at Sen. Ted Cruz after his Twitter account "liked" a sexual video clip is an allegation that Cruz has backed a ban on sex toys. The New York Post, among news outlets tracking the moment, tweeted: "This is the same senator who once supported a ban on sex toys." We’re unaware of Sen. Cruz, elected in 2012 and seeking re-election in 2018, calling for a ban on sex toys. So, what was the Post talking about? The Post’s tweet linked to the newspaper’s Sept. 12, 2017, news story, which said, without added detail: "Cruz, a Republican from Texas, is known for his strong religious convictions and family values stance — and once even supported a ban on sex toys." Cruz calls claim ‘totally false’ Cruz did not respond to our inquiry for this fact-check. But he objected on Sept. 13, 2017, when CNN’s Dana Bash asked: "Do you appreciate the irony that you once defended a Texas law banning sales of sex toys?" "No," Cruz said. "That’s a good example, Dana, where the media runs with things that are just totally false." He elaborated that at one time, his duties as solicitor general for the Texas attorney general’s office included defending state laws. "One of those laws was a law restricting the sale of sex toys. It’s a stupid law," Cruz said, adding that he believes consenting adults should do what they please in the privacy of their bedrooms. To get our own fix on Cruz’s actions, we turned to news accounts, a legal brief, an appeals court ruling and an extensive April 2016 Mother Jones story about Cruz’s role in a decade-old case that didn’t rise to the Supreme Court. Law upheld, then found unconstitutional At issue: The State of Texas defending section 43.23 of the state’s penal code, which states: "A person commits an offense if, knowing its content and character, he wholesale promotes or possesses with intent to wholesale promote any obscene material or obscene device." After a U.S. district judge dismissed a challenge to the law, businesses selling sex toys appealed to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where a three-judge panel, by 2-1, agreed with the business-plaintiffs and found the law in violation of the 14th Amendment right to privacy. The state didn’t appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. February 2008 news accounts from the Associated Press and Austin American-Statesman said the ruling overturned the state’s ban on sex toys. Under the spurned law, the American-Statesman story said, it had been illegal to sell, advertise, give or lend obscene devices, defined as a device used primarily for sexual stimulation. "Anyone in possession of six or more sexual devices is considered to be promoting them," the story said, adding that the law dated to the 1970s and had seldom been enforced. Cruz’s role And what was Cruz’s role? Cruz, who had been solicitor general since 2003, didn’t present the state’s oral argument before the appellate panel, according to two attorneys involved in the dispute, Louis Sirkin, who represented businesses challenging the law, and James C. Todd, a since-retired assistant attorney general who defended the law in district court. Todd and Sirkin each told us the oral argument was given by another state lawyer, Bill L. Davis. In ruling against the state, the appellate judges cited Lawrence and Garner v. Texas, the U.S. Supreme Court's 2003 opinion striking down bans on consensual sex between gay couples. "Just as in Lawrence," the judges wrote, "the state here wants to use its laws to enforce a public moral code by restricting private intimate conduct. The case is not about public sex. It is not about controlling commerce in sex. It is about controlling what people do in the privacy of their own homes because the state is morally opposed to a certain type of consensual private intimate conduct. This is an insufficient justification after Lawrence." Appeals brief Earlier, the state framed its arguments for upholding the law in a January 2007 brief listing the names of the then-attorney general, Greg Abbott, and five state attorneys working for the agency helmed by Abbott -- including Cruz, Todd and Davis, whose signature alone appears on the brief and, again alone, on the state’s unsuccessful post-ruling motion for rehearing. Our request to interview Davis didn’t draw a reply from Attorney General Ken Paxton’s office. The state’s brief notes that no state law bars the private use of sexual devices nor is there a limit on advertising such products to meet medical needs. It’s the government’s legitimate interest to guard against the commercial sale of sex and "discouraging prurient interests in sexual gratification" and "protecting minors," the brief says. Further, the brief says, the First Amendment doesn’t protect commercial speech related to unlawful activity. The brief also says, in bold: "There is no substantive-due-process right to stimulate one’s genitals for non-medical reasons unrelated to procreation or outside of an interpersonal relationship." This section of the brief goes on to say the Supreme Court hasn’t identified such a right. Lawyers comment To our inquiries, Todd and Gary Krupkin, a Dallas First Amendment lawyer who represents businesses selling such products, each commented by phone that Cruz supported restricting sex toys but that defending state laws also was his duty. "Obviously," Todd said, "the solicitor general doesn’t write every brief. There’s no doubt in my mind that Cruz would have reviewed it in some way," he said. So, Todd said, Cruz "defended it. A lawyer’s name on the brief means something. He was on it near the top, right under Greg Abbott’s. He was responsible for assigning the case. He would have been responsible for supervising the" respective "lawyer." It ultimately was Cruz’s duty to defend the law, each lawyer said. And that’s "regardless of his beliefs," Todd said. "Our job in the attorney general’s office was to make whatever case there is to be made about the law." Krupkin said: "Cruz in his official capacity as solicitor general supported a ban. It gets too close to the line when you say Ted Cruz" personally "did this. Ted Cruz did that in his official position. I myself see a difference between the two," he said. Our ruling The Post’s tweet called Cruz "the same senator who once supported a ban on sex toys." This statement incorrectly suggests that Cruz called for a ban on sex toys while serving in the Senate or otherwise personally held that belief. We find no evidence to support that contention. In his position as a state lawyer, still, Cruz helped unsuccessfully defend a Texas law barring commercial promotion of sex toys--an action giving this claim an element of truth.

pomt-14760	"Under conservative leadership, Congress has reduced the federal deficit by 60 percent – nearly $800 billion."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/dec/11/american-action-network/conservatives-slashed-federal-deficit-60-group-say/	A national "dark money" group ran a pro-Paul Ryan ad in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that credits conservatives for slashing the federal deficit. Conservatives? A Democrat has been in the White House since 2009 and Democrats have controlled the U.S. Senate for most of the time since then. Of course, House Republicans such as Ryan have played a key role in the federal budget. So let’s see what the American Action Network is talking about. The network’s ad The Washington, D.C.-based group, founded in 2010 by former Republican U.S. Sen. Norm Coleman of Minnesota, says it promotes "center-right solutions to our nation’s challenges." It is a so-called dark-money nonprofit in that it is not required to disclose the names of its donors. The group ran ads against Democrat Russ Feingold in 2010, who lost his U.S. Senate seat later that year to Republican Ron Johnson. The group’ half-page ad ran in the Journal Sentinel on Dec. 7 and 8, 2015 and is said to be part of a $3 million national campaign. The attention-getting photo at the top of the ad shows 26 older white people and carried this headline: "What’s the top priority of the new leadership in Congress? Fighting for the conservative principles that keep America strong." The ad also featured a picture of Ryan and urged readers to thank the newly installed speaker of the House for "making America stronger." It said the Janesville Republican is working with conservatives in Congress to "rein in runaway spending," then made this claim: "Under conservative leadership, Congress has reduced the federal deficit by 60 percent – nearly $800 billion." Network’s evidence As a reminder, the federal deficit is the difference in a given year between the government’s receipts and its expenditures. That’s different from the debt, an accumulation of deficits that is approaching $19 trillion. To back its claim, the American Action Network compared the deficit in 2010 to 2015, citing figures from a gold-standard source, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. We’ll note that the federal fiscal year starts Oct. 1 and ends Sept. 30. For example, fiscal 2015 started Oct. 1, 2014 and ended Sept. 30, 2015. Here are the annual deficits during that period. Fiscal year Federal budget deficit 2010 $1.29 trillion 2011 $1.3 trillion 2012 $1.09 trillion 2013 $680 billion 2014 $483 billion 2015 $439 billion American Action Network told us it picked 2010 as the starting point because at that time, Democrats controlled the Senate and the House (as well as the White House), before Republicans took control of the House in 2011. Spokeswoman Emily Davis told us: "Given Democrats' record and budget plans, does anyone honestly believe that the deficit would be the same today or better without Republicans leading the House?" OK. But Democrats dominated the federal government during the period the group cites: Year Party in the White House Party in control of U.S. Senate Party in control of U.S. House 2010 Democratic Democratic Democratic 2011 Democratic Democratic Republican 2012 Democratic Democratic Republican 2013 Democratic Democratic Republican 2014 Democratic Democratic Republican 2015 Democratic Republican Republican So, it would be difficult to give total credit to the minority party for deficit reductions, which is what American Action Network does. Other factors more important When Obama said in his State of the Union address in January 2015 that the country has seen "our deficits cut by two-thirds," PolitiFact National’s rating was Mostly True. Like American Action Network, Obama was correct with his figures. But his claim was more general, whereas the network specifically credited conservatives for deficit reduction. That not only is problematic in that Republicans had relatively little power compared to Democrats, but because the overall economy has a much bigger impact on deficits than governmental actions such as spending cuts do. Steve Ellis, vice president of the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense, told us Republicans deserve credit for trimming increases in spending that would have been in place had Democrats maintained control of the House. At the same time, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was also approved by the Democratic-controlled Senate and by Obama. Experts also say the deficit has come down in recent years at least as much because of the improving economy, which drives tax revenues up and lessens spending on programs such as food stamps and Medicaid. Economist Alan Auerbach, director of a tax policy and public finance center at the University of California, Berkeley, told us the higher revenues -- especially from individual and corporate income taxes -- had a much bigger impact on deficits than any changes made by the Congress or the president. Obama, of course, and perhaps to a lesser extent GOP leaders in Congress, could claim some, but not all, of the credit for the improved economy. Our rating American Action Network said: "Under conservative leadership, Congress has reduced the federal deficit by 60 percent – nearly $800 billion." The deficit reduction is actually somewhat larger for the period cited by the network, 2010 to 2015. But for most of that period, Republicans controlled only the House. Meanwhile, Democrats controlled the Senate for nearly the entire period, with fellow Democrat Obama in the White House. And the recovering economy, boosting tax revenues, has played a greater role as politicians in bringing deficits down. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression -- our definition of Mostly False.

pomt-02010	"Obama Signs Bill Forgiving All Student Loan Debt."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/09/chain-email/did-barack-obama-sign-bill-forgive-all-outstanding/	Sometimes art mirrors real life so closely that it’s hard to tell the two apart. On June 9, 2014, President Barack Obama made a speech announcing a "presidential memorandum" that allows 5 million federal student loan holders to cap their monthly payments at 10 percent of their income. That announcement followed the introduction of a Senate Democratic bill that would aid borrowers in two ways. The bill would allow students with existing debt to refinance to the interest rate new borrowers can get -- 3.86 percent. The bill also offers an option to refinance private student loans into the federal student-loan system. Right around the same time, debt-laden Americans were noticing chain emails and social media posts with a headline that offered something even bolder -- "Obama Signs Bill Forgiving All Student Loan Debt." A PolitiFact reader was skeptical and asked us to look into it. As is often the case these days, we found that this "news" cluttering up users’ inboxes and feeds was a bit of satire -- or, to those unable to detect much humor in the item, a sly bit of clickbait designed to generate ad revenue. Here’s a portion of the article published in the online publication Empire News (you can read the full article here): "Americans who are under the financial strain of repaying student loan debt may now be off the hook for their education costs. President Obama signed a new federal bill this week releasing any student who has accrued outstanding debt because of the high interest rates and outrageous balances caused by college loans. " ‘Any student, past or present, who has taken loans from the federal government within the last 10 years to pay for higher education, will no longer be required to pay back those loans,’ said President Obama. ‘This forgiveness also is to be extended to any student currently enrolled in college, who may need financial assistance for the next several years as they finish their degrees.’ " If you’re a student with a lot of debt, this sounds great. But it’s too good to be true. The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau estimates that outstanding student loans total roughly $1 trillion. That works out to about one-third of the entire annual federal budget -- an enormous amount that, even if it was phased out over a few years, would lead to even greater deficits, budget cuts or tax increases. Using a back-of-the-envelope calculation, phasing out just one fifth of the student debt total each year for five years -- $200 billion a year -- would mean adding an annual outlay equal to today’s combined budgets for the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Justice, Labor and Transportation. As it turns out, the article was never even intended to be accurate. Empire News has a "disclaimer" page that says, "Empire News is a satirical and entertainment website. We only use invented names in all our stories, except in cases when public figures are being satirized. Any other use of real names is accidental and coincidental." The article’s focus on student loans gains some believability from Obama’s long association with the topic. For instance, during the 2008 presidential campaign, Obama promised to overhaul the government’s relationship with private student lenders and ensure that the maximum Pell Grant award is increased for low-income students. Both of those earned a Promise Kept on our promise tracker, the Obameter. The Senate bill, which Obama has endorsed, would allow existing student-loan borrowers to refinance at lower interest rates, which backers say could "save a typical student $2,000 over the life of his or her loans." The pending measure, sponsored by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., faces a tough road to enactment, even with Obama’s support. Republicans oppose the measure, which Warren wants to pay for with an income tax hike on Americans who earn more than $1 million a year. Our ruling Emails and social media posts are circulating a claim that "Obama Signs Bill Forgiving All Student Loan Debt." But while Obama has taken executive action and called for passage of a student-loan refinancing bill now pending in the Senate, he didn’t say he was planning to forgive all student debts -- a far more massive undertaking. The claim is ridiculously false, so we rate it Pants on Fire.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2014-06-09T16:38:18	2014-06-05	['None']
pomt-05974	"[N]early one in three primary care doctors are forced to limit the number of Medicare patients they see."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/jan/24/tom-price/congressmans-claim-about-medicare-mostly-rings-tru/	Seniors, if you’re struggling to find a doctor that takes Medicare, U.S. Rep. Tom Price has diagnosed your problem. Doctors won’t take patients covered by the federal health insurance program for seniors because Medicare pays them less than what the care actually costs, Price said in a recent op-ed in the Boston Herald. "Already, nearly one in three primary care doctors are forced to limit the number of Medicare patients they see," said Price, who worked as an orthopedic surgeon. We thought the Roswell Republican’s number was worth a closer look. If there is a problem, it could get worse Feb. 29. That’s when Medicare will cut doctor pay by some 27 percent, unless Congress does something about it. Medicare calculates how much it pays doctors according to a special formula set up in 1997 to keep the federal deficit in check. In 2002, that formula gave doctors a pay cut, but physician backlash was so bad that lawmakers have put off reductions ever since. Each time Congress puts off the problem, the cost of fixing it grows. We asked Price spokesman Ryan Murphy for more information on the congressman’s Medicare figure. He said it was confirmed by a May 2010 survey by the American Medical Association, a group that represents doctors’ interests and promotes medicine and public health. The AMA’s online survey of more than 9,000 physicians found that 31 percent of primary care doctors "restrict" the number of Medicare patients in their practice. Some of these doctors don’t accept new Medicare patients, and only treat the ones they already have. Others have stopped treating them at all. Some 83 percent said they did so because Medicare payment rates are too low, the AMA survey said. And 82 percent said they made the move because they were concerned about the threat of future payment cuts. We asked the AMA for the poll’s methodology and found it has a major shortcoming. It wasn’t scientific. Also, the AMA is a powerful lobbying group with its own set of interests. We therefore sought out data from independent sources that took a scientific approach. The data we found was not strictly comparable to the AMA’s, but it did tell us that the findings of the physicians group did not clash with other research. For instance, there’s a 2008 survey by the Center for Studying Health System Change, which provides research used by the federal government and policymakers on both sides of the aisle. The center conducted a nationally representative mail survey of 4,700 physicians. It found that among primary care physicians, 37 percent said they accept some or no new Medicare patients. Of those, more than 56 percent said that inadequate reimbursements were a moderately important or very important reason why. About 48 percent of those who restricted how many Medicare patients they took on said a moderately important or very important reason why was that their practices were already at capacity. There’s also 2009 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which found that some 19 percent of primary care physicians did not accept any new Medicare patients. This number is a lot lower than the AMA’s figure, but it doesn’t mean the doctors group is incorrect. About 10 percent of the CDC’s respondents said they did not know if they accepted new Medicare patients. Also, the data did not specify whether the doctors who accept new ones limit how many they bring on. On its face, the AMA data is not unreasonable. None of the data we reviewed expressly contradicts the finding that 31 percent of primary care doctors "restrict" the number of Medicare patients in their practice. Furthermore, data from the Center for Studying Health System Change appear to support the AMA’s finding. So, is Dr. Price right? Are nearly one in three primary care doctors "forced to limit the number of Medicare patients they see"? The congressman’s number seems sensible, but his language is overheated. It’s not clear that the physicians who drop or restrict Medicare were "forced" to do so because of declining reimbursements or red tape. Nearly half of the primary care physicians responding to the Center for Studying Health System Change survey said one of the reasons they accept so few new Medicare patients is that their practices are full. We recommend Price give his feverish rhetoric an aspirin. And it wouldn’t hurt if he got a second or third opinion on the American Medical Association’s data. Price earns a Mostly True.

pomt-07888	Many of the 9/11 conspirators came from the Muslim Brotherhood, including Osama bin Laden, Ayman Zawahiri and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/04/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-al-qaeda-links-muslim-brotherhood/	As Americans watch the Egyptian uprising from afar, politicians and pundits have speculated about whether the Muslim Brotherhood, an opposition group, will gain power. On his radio show on Jan. 31, Glenn Beck said listeners should know that conspirators of the 9/11 attacks were part of the group. "So the Muslim Brotherhood, they're nothing to worry about," Beck began sarcastically. "Abdullah Azzam and Muhammad Qutb, they taught in Saudi Arabia," Beck said. "…Their star student? Osama bin Laden." "Then, from the Egyptian Brotherhood, you have (Ayman) al-Zawahiri," a prominent leader of al-Qaida, he said. "And another star pupil that has come out of the Muslim Brotherhood? Khalid Sheikh Mohammed," Beck said, referring to the al-Qaida leader described in the 9/11 Commission Report as "the principal architect of the 9/11 attacks." The Muslim Brotherhood, the largest opposition movement in Egypt, seeks to establish an Islamic state governed by sharia or Islamic law. It's true that many al-Qaida members, and 9/11 conspirators specifically, can trace their roots through the Muslim Brotherhood at one time. But the two groups are now bitter rivals. While the Muslim Brotherhood has evolved into a group that says it seeks a gradual and peaceful path to power, al-Qaida has pursued a violent holy war. The Muslim Brotherhood has repeatedly denounced al-Qaida, and vice versa. In an article titled "Don't Fear Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood," Bruce Riedel of the Brookings Institution wrote that "The Egyptian Brotherhood renounced violence years ago, but its relative moderation has made it the target of extreme vilification by more radical Islamists. Al Qaida’s leaders, Osama bin Laden and Ayman Zawahiri, started their political lives affiliated with the Brotherhood but both have denounced it for decades as too soft and a cat’s paw of Mubarak and America." Dan Byman, an expert on the groups at the Brookings Institution, said they have some common goals such as support for a political identity with Islam. But some of the more militant members of the Muslim Brotherhood have moved on to join al-Qaida, believing that the Muslim Brotherhood isn't doing enough, Byman said. The biggest question, Byman said, is whether the Muslim Brotherhood is a barrier to the violent extremism of al-Qaida or whether it is simply a farm team. Byman believes it's probably a little bit of both. Beck is technically correct that many al-Qaida terrorists were once members of the Muslim Brotherhood, said Evan Kohlmann, a terrorism expert who consults for the Department of Justice, "Unfortunately, this analogy is a bit like saying that the Boy Scouts are a paramilitary organization because a certain percentage of them later go on to enlist in the U.S. military." "Here's the deal on the Brotherhood: they aren't exactly in sync with U.S. foreign policy interests, and they do admittedly continue to work with armed groups that have violent aims, like Hamas in Gaza for instance," Kohlman told us via e-mail. "Nonetheless, there is no doubt that the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood is an avowed enemy of Osama Bin Laden, and vice versa. The Brotherhood repeatedly makes that point clear on its own website -- and for its part, al-Qaida has issued numerous audio and video recordings from its senior leadership (including Bin Laden and Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri) accusing the Brotherhood of adopting reviled democratic methods and of 'collaboration with the nation's enemies.'" Now, the specifics on the al-Qaida members. Osama Bin Laden -- According to the book Through Our Enemies' Eyes: Osama bin Laden Radical Islam and the Future of America by Michael Scheuer, bin Laden was heavily influenced by two Muslim Brotherhood leaders -- Abdullah Azzam and Muhammad Qutb -- when he was a student at King Abdul Aziz University in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in the late 1970s. Scheuer writes that bin Laden's "faith was made more assertive" by these scholars. Star pupil? Undetermined, but we'll allow Beck some hyperbole. Ayman al-Zawahiri -- Although many biographies and news articles claim Dr. al-Zawahiri -- often described now as the number two in al-Qaida -- was briefly a member of the Muslim Brotherhood in his early teens, that's a matter of some debate. When Germany's Der Spiegel reported in a July 2, 2007, story "Charting the Rise of the Muslim Brotherhood," that al- Zawahiri "is now considered the textbook example of a member of the Muslim Brotherhood turned terrorist," the Muslim Brotherhood protested. The group issued a public rejection of the claim that al-Zawahiri has ever been affiliated with it. Dr. Mohamed Morsy, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood Executive Bureau, said al-Zawahiri had never been a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and has never conformed to the group's ideology. "The Muslim Brotherhood's ideology shuns violence and the movement has never practiced it," Morsy said. "On the contrary we have been always adopting peaceful means for change." Kohlmann, a terrorism analyst with New York-based security consultancy Flashpoint Global Partners who monitors jihadist websites, pointed to comments al-Zawahiri made in an open online question-and-answer session hosted by several al-Qaida-affiliated websites in 2008. According to al-Zawahiri, "the freedom which the Brotherhood and other groups enjoy these days is only due to the military activities... But, instead of thanking the mujihadeen -- or at least not speaking ill of them--they have presented themselves as a mutually-agreeable alternative to America and its agents, to insult and to defame the mujahideen...They should make an effort to improve the image of their organization after all the miserable situations in which they have become entangled -- much as pledging allegiance to Hosni Mubarak and their silence while their brothers entered Kabul and Baghdad on the backs of Christian tanks." Al-Zawahiri also repeatedly and pointedly criticized the Muslim Brotherhood in his book, The Bitter Harvest. And in addition to the Muslim Brotherhood roundly denying that al-Zawahiri was ever a member, al-Zawahiri himself has "vigorously and indignantly contested allegations that he was ever affiliated with the Brotherhood in Egypt," Kohlmann said. "So the idea that Zawahiri has anything to do with the Brotherhood is pretty much a total canard." Khalid Sheikh Mohammed -- For him, we refer to the 9/11 Commission Report, page 145, which states, "Raised in a religious family, KSM claims to have joined the Muslim Brotherhood at age 16 and to have become enamored of violent jihad at youth camps in the desert." So Beck is right that many 9/11 conspirators have come out of, or once ascribed to the teachings of, the Muslim Brotherhood -- including Osama bin Laden and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed for sure, while the case for al-Zawahiri is less clear. But Beck's comments ignore the sharply different approaches of the two groups. Each has disavowed the other, and each has charted a different path to power (at least publicly). "The real question -- what the Brotherhood is -- is very much an open question," Byman said. "In Egypt, in a way, we don't know. It's hard to know what part of its rhetoric to believe." But by failing to even mention the divide between the Muslim Brotherhood and al-Qaida, Beck has left out key context in his history lesson, and so we rate his statement Half True.

pomt-05307	On gun policy	half flip	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/18/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-exhibits-marked-change-gun-rhetoric/	Mitt Romney has at times had an awkward relationship with firearms, as when he said during the 2008 Republican presidential primary that his hunting experience generally involved "small varmints." But has he flip-flopped on gun policy? We’ll start by noting that the Flip-O-Meter rates politicians' consistency on particular topics from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on their decisions to change their minds. It’s simply gauging whether they did. Romney’s statements on gun restrictions before he became governor In 1994, Romney challenged Democratic Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and lost. In 2002, he ran successfully for governor of Massachusetts. During his campaign against Kennedy, Romney supported two gun control measures -- the Brady Bill, which required background checks for gun purchases, and a ban on certain types of assault weapons. Both were strongly opposed by most gun-rights advocates. In a July 1994 question-and-answer session with voters arranged by the Boston Herald, Romney "reaffirmed" his support for both measures. "I don't think (the waiting period) will have a massive effect on crime, but I think it will have a positive effect," Romney said. In a subsequent interview published on Sept. 23, 1994, Romney said, "I don't want special-interest groups making this their campaign. I don't want their money. I don't want their help. This is my race." In the interview, Romney specifically mentioned gun-rights advocates, acknowledging that his stands on the two gun-control measures would put him at odds with such groups. "That's not going to make me the hero of the NRA," he said, referring to the National Rifle Association. "I don't line up with a lot of special interest groups." Then, in his 2002 race for governor, Romney said during a debate against against Democrat Shannon O'Brien, "We have tough gun laws in Massachusetts; I support them." In both cases, Romney expressed views favorable to certain kinds of gun-control laws. This is not too surprising, since he was running for statewide office in Massachusetts, which tends to be more favorable toward those laws than more rural parts of the country. Romney’s views on an assault-weapons ban as governor In 2004, in the middle of his single four-year term as governor, Romney signed a permanent ban on assault weapons -- reportedly the first such state law in the country. "These guns are not made for recreation or self-defense," the Globe quoted Romney as saying. "They are instruments of destruction with the sole purpose of hunting down and killing people." Despite that provision -- usually a deal-breaker for gun-rights groups -- the measure received support from pro-gun groups because other provisions lengthened the terms of firearm ID cards and licenses to carry firearms. The Globe reported that during the 2008 campaign, Romney described the bill as a "consensus measure" and a "positive step." Not long after Romney signed the bill, Romney appeared on the Aug. 4, 2004, edition of the Fox News program Hannity and Colmes. Guest co-host Pat Halpin asked Romney about the existing federal assault weapons ban, which was then on a path to expiring due to intentional Republican inaction. "So are you in favor of that ban being extended or do you want to see it lapse?" Romney responded, "I believe the people should have the right to bear arms, but I don't believe that we have to have assault weapons as part of our personal arsenal. … In my state I just signed a piece of legislation extending the ban on certain assault weapons in our state." Halpin continued to prod. "Governor, would you like to see that extended again on the federal level, as well?" she asked. Romney replied, "It very well may be. In our state what we did is we got both sides of this issue to come together, because we relaxed a number of things, allowing people who hadn't been able to get weapons in the past to be able to purchase those. … There are hunters in the NRA and the gun owners' action league (who) backed the legislation that said, ‘Look, let's protect our citizens from dangerous assault weapons, but let's also make … regular weapons more available to our citizens.’ And we made a compromise that works." Romney, at that moment, appears to be straddling the issue, arguing that ordinary Americans have the right to bear some types of arms but not assault weapons. He said it "very well may be necessary" to extend the federal assault-weapons ban, while adding that he acted on the state ban because it was a compromise that included expansions of other types of gun ownership rules. Romney’s statements during the 2008 presidential campaign Romney’s rhetoric on gun control began to shift as he made his first bid for the White House in 2008. • Addressing a National Rifle Association members by video on Sept. 10, 2007, Romney said, "I support the Second Amendment as one of the most basic and fundamental rights of every American. It's essential to our functioning as a free society, as are all the liberties enumerated in the Bill of Rights." He repeated that message later that month at a meeting of the National Shooting Sports Foundation. • On the Oct. 21, 2007, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation, host Bob Schieffer challenged Romney on the evolution of his gun-control position. Schieffer said, "You once said, ‘We do have tough gun laws in Massachusetts, I support them, I won't chip away at them. I believe they protect us.’ Now you say you are a gun owner. You have joined the National Rifle Association, after saying at one point, ‘I don't line up with the National Rifle Association.’ Why would you join that group?" Romney responded, "I support the NRA. I support Second Amendment rights, but I don't line up 100 percent with the NRA. They take some positions that are different than mine. But my positions are the same as my positions have been with regards to guns for a long, long time, and that is that I respect the right of people to bear arms, and whether that's for hunting or personal protection. ..." • During a Republican presidential debate on Jan. 24, 2008, in Boca Raton, Fla., fellow Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee challenged Romney on his views about gun control. Romney responded, "I do support the Second Amendment. And I believe that this is an individual right of citizens and not a right of government. And I hope the Supreme Court reaches that same conclusion." He continued, "I also, like the president, would have signed the assault weapon ban that came to his desk. I said I would have supported that and signed a similar bill in our state. It was a bill worked out, by the way, between pro-gun lobby and anti-gun lobby individuals. Both sides of the issue came together and found a way to provide relaxation in licensing requirements and allow more people to have guns for their own legal purposes. And so we signed that in Massachusetts, and I said I would support that at the federal level, just as the president said he would. It did not pass at the federal level. I do not believe we need new legislation. "I do not support any new legislation of an assault weapon ban nature, including that against semiautomatic weapons. I instead believe that we have laws in place that if they're implemented and enforced, will provide the protection and the safety of the American people. But I do not support any new legislation, and I do support the right of individuals to bear arms, whether for hunting purposes or for protection purposes or any other reason. That's the right that people have." • In a candidate questionnaire during the 2008 primary campaign, the Washington Post asked Romney, "Do you think tighter restrictions should be in place for those buying a firearm?" Romney answered, "No. I believe we need to focus on enforcing our current laws rather than creating new laws that burden lawful gun owners. ... I do not believe in a one-size-fits-all federal approach to gun ownership because people keep and use firearms for different reasons. ..." Collectively, Romney’s comments from the 2008 campaign suggest that he heightened his rhetorical support for gun rights, while maintaining some distance from NRA orthodoxy. On actual policies, though, Romney doesn’t appear to have changed his position. Romney’s statements during the 2012 presidential campaign Whatever lingering tolerance Romney expressed for gun control in 2008 disappeared in the heat of a contentious 2012 Republican primary. The issues section of Romney’s website offers a clear endorsement of gun rights: "The Second Amendment is essential to the functioning of our free society. Mitt strongly supports the right of all law-abiding Americans to exercise their constitutionally protected right to own firearms and to use them for lawful purposes, including hunting, recreational shooting, self-defense, and the protection of family and property. Like the majority of Americans, Mitt does not believe that the United States needs additional laws that restrict the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms." The website even touts the bill Romney signed as governor but ignores the assault-weapons portion. "As governor of Massachusetts, Mitt was proud to support legislation that expanded the rights of gun owners. He worked hard to advance the ability of law-abiding citizens to purchase and own firearms, while opposing liberal desires to create bureaucracy intended to burden gun owners and sportsmen." Romney offered a similar message in an address to the national convention of the NRA in St. Louis on April 13, 2012: "We need a president who will enforce current laws, not create new ones that only serve to burden lawful gun owners. President Obama has not; I will. We need a president who will stand up for the rights of hunters, sportsmen, and those seeking to protect their homes and their families. President Obama has not; I will. And if we are going to safeguard our Second Amendment, it is time to elect a president who will defend the rights President Obama ignores or minimizes. I will." Our ruling During his campaigns for statewide Massachusetts office, Romney openly spoke of his support for -- to use his words from 2002 -- "tough gun laws." As recently as the 2008 Republican primary, Romney said "I don't line up 100 percent with the NRA." But since then, his pro-gun rhetoric has become sharper and virtually all nuance was erased. He even touted the bill he signed in Massachusetts by scrubbing any reference to the provisions banning assault weapons. Still, while Romney’s rhetoric has moved distinctly in the NRA’s direction, it’s not clear that his policy positions have changed. This is partly because Romney, even in the 1994 campaign didn’t take a full-blown, pro-gun-control stand. And even now, as his rhetoric has become more pro-gun, Romney has never gone so far as to specifically renounce his prior positions, such as his signing of the 2004 Massachusetts law, which at the time was billed as a compromise measure. So Romney’s shift has been more on the rhetorical level than substantive. He earns the rating of Half Flip.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-05-18T15:24:54	2012-04-13	['None']
pomt-09452	Texas is the "fastest growing state" with the "most Fortune 500 companies."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/mar/07/rick-perry/perry-says-texas-fastest-growing-state-most-fortun/	After Gov. Rick Perry won the 2010 Republican nomination for governor Tuesday, he thanked voters in a cinematic Web video posted on his campaign site. The "Leader" video, set to rock music, shows stampeding horses, standing ovations and a glamour shot of Perry. More than 20 proclaimed accomplishments flash by on the screen including two claims PolitiFact Texas hadn't previously checked — that Texas has the "most Fortune 500 companies" and that it's the "fastest-growing state." Superlative claims often draw our attention; sometimes they stretch the truth. We decided to look first at whether Texas is home to the most Fortune 500 companies. Every year, Fortune magazine ranks the top 500 U.S. companies by revenue. In 2009, Texas was home to the most companies in the compilation, topped by Exxon Mobil, which had more than $442 billion, and also including behemoths such as ConocoPhillips, AT&T and Valero Energy. In 2009, Texas was the hostess with the mostest, with 64 Fortune 500 companies; Texas also topped the list in 2006 and 2008. New York and California were home to 56 and 51 companies, respectively, in 2009. And how about Texas being touted as the fastest-growing state in the United States? Perry's campaign pointed us to population data from the U.S. Census Bureau, which reported in December that Texas gained more residents than any other state between July 2008 and July 2009, when the bureau issued its last population estimates in advance of the 2010 census. That's 478,012 additional people — no small potatoes. California had the next highest number: 381,293. Still, doesn't it stand to reason that a state that already has the second-biggest population — Texas — will tend to add more people than less populous states? Does that really mean the state is growing faster than all others? Not exactly. Robert Bernstein, a public information officer at the Census Bureau, said: "The term 'fastest-growing' is somewhat subjective. When we (at the bureau) say 'fastest-growing,' we usually mean highest rate of growth." In the July-to-July period, Wyoming and Utah had the highest rate of growth at about 2.1 percent each. Texas wasn't far behind at 2 percent, followed by Colorado, with a 1.8 percent bump in population. Bernstein said: "You might want to say Texas had the highest numerical growth in the country, rather than (it) was the fastest-growing state." Of course, Perry's fastest-growing-state statement makes for a sharper sound bite. But it fuzzes the fact that two Western states grew a little faster in the same time period. And when we looked at year-to-year growth covering previous years, other states also outpaced Texas. For instance, from July 2007 to July 2008, Texas similarly added the most new residents. But its rate of population growth trailed both Utah and Arizona. From 2006 to 2007, Texas had the seventh-highest rate of growth of the states. Where does that leave us? In 2009, Texas was home to the most Fortune 500 companies. And it gained more people than any other state from July 2008 to July 2009. But raw numbers don't tell the whole story. Comparative growth is best measured by the rate at which it occurs. By that measure, Wyoming and Utah grew faster than Texas from July 2008 to July 2009. Texas was outpaced by other states during each of the two immediately preceding year-to-year periods as well. We rate Perry's combined claims as Half True.

pomt-10615	"And he's the only candidate who will fight for a national catastrophe fund to reduce insurance rates."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/18/rudy-giuliani/strong-supporter-yes-the-only-fan-no/	In a television advertisement aimed directly at Florida voters, Rudy Giuliani tried to differentiate himself from the crowded Republican field. "And he's the only candidate who will fight for a national catastrophe fund to reduce insurance rates," says an announcer during the spot, which debuted Jan. 16, 2008. The topic is a right of passage for presidential hopefuls who visit Florida because it's an issue on the minds of many homeowners hit with rising insurance costs. It's also a political calculation: A major proponent of the fund is Republican Gov. Charlie Crist, a much-sought endorsement. It's true, Giuliani is a strong supporter — the strongest in the GOP field. But other candidates have also expressed support, or at least an open mind. Giuliani aside, the other Republican candidates want to see the fine print first. On a spectrum — from supportive to skeptical — this is how they appear to fall: Giuliani, John McCain, Mitt Romney, Mike Huckabee, Fred Thompson. Ron Paul and Duncan Hunter go unranked because they haven't spoken about it. Florida political reporters have asked this question to just about every candidate. For your consideration, below are their full statements to the question of whether they support a national catastrophe fund: • Giuliani, at a speech to Florida lawmakers in Tallahassee in April 2007: "... I think it is a very good idea. I think it's a very good idea not just for Florida, it's a very good idea for the whole country. We all need it. You need it for hurricanes, California needs it for earthquakes, somebody else needs it for tornadoes. New York needs it for ice storms and for hurricanes. ... The parts of the country that think it only helps Florida, I think are missing all the other natural catastrophes and disasters and maybe they are not hurricanes, but they are all the other things I mentioned." • McCain, during a September 2007 interview with the St. Petersburg Times: "If people are going to build homes where hurricanes hit, they have to assume a great part of that liability. We don't have that many hurricanes that hit Arizona, as you know. We need to all work together and see if the present unacceptable situation can be remedied, and if that requires some federal action, I'm for it — but not just insuring anybody for any circumstance. I'm not going to do that. I would not support such a thing." • Romney from a town hall forum in Orange Park in September 2007: " ... I would devote energy and time to understanding why it is that the private insurers are not providing insurance to people who live along the coastline or in hazardous areas. If we need federal support of some kind, that's something I'm open to. But I certainly want to talk to the insurers to understand: do they have capital sufficient for this responsibility; if not, why not? What role could the government play? But I'm not going to at this stage give a final answer to that. It's something that I would make a priority in my administration: to identify the needs of homeowners in places which are high-risk areas." • Huckabee, during a May 2007 interview with the Times: He said he was receptive but rebuilding people's beach homes doesn't appeal to him. Still, he said, "I come from a state that's prone to tornadoes and floods. I understand how devastating it can be, so I'm very sympathetic." • Thompson during an September 2007 interview with the Times: "No, I don't know enough about it yet. I know that it's an issue, I know that it's being talked about. That's one of the things I want to talk to people about while I'm down here, make sure I understand what's being proposed. But I'll give it serious consideration ..." (Campaign spokesman Jeff Sadosky added in a Jan. 16, 2008, interview that Thompson believes a fund "is something worth looking at" but he also wants to explore the idea of a "regional compact.") • Paul, the congressman from Texas, hasn't commented directly on the issue. • Duncan Hunter, the congressman from California, has not commented on the issue directly. So when an announcer says Giuliani is "the only candidate who will fight for" a national fund, he has a case. He pledges to be a strong advocate, unlike the other candidates. But some others in the field are open to a federal role in securing homeowner insurance in high-risk areas, so we rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-12792	Says Donald Trump was "caught investing in (the) Dakota Pipeline before signing it."	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/feb/16/learnprogressorg/trump-caught-investing-dakota-access-pipeline-appr/	A left-leaning blog asserts that President Donald Trump was busted for approving the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline for financial gain, but the facts of the case ended up being buried. "Breaking: Trump caught investing in Dakota Pipeline before signing it," read the headline on an undated post on LearnProgress.org. The blog regularly posts items lambasting Trump and his policies. Facebook flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of its efforts to weed out fake news in its users’ feeds. Most instances of the story being shared on Facebook are on Feb. 8, 2017. The website did not answer our request to confirm the date. But the implication that Trump approved the pipeline in order to profit from its construction doesn’t hold up to scrutiny. In the post, LearnProgress.org cited a Nov. 26, 2016, Associated Press report that showed Trump owned shares in two companies involved in the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, a 1,168-mile crude oil pipeline that runs from North Dakota to Illinois. Environmentalists and Native American tribes have opposed the route of the pipeline, and in December then-President Barack Obama blocked completion of the project. The AP story pointed out that Trump owned between $15,000 and $50,000 in stock for a Texas company called Energy Transfer Partners. He had between $500,000 and $1 million the year before that. He also owned between $100,000 and $250,000 in stock in energy company Phillips 66, which the AP says has a one-quarter share of the pipeline. This was considered a potential conflict of interest for the future president, but to say he was "caught" is out of bounds. He listed the information on May 2016 federal disclosure forms. Much has been made of Trump’s stock in the companies. The issue was reported on widely, as was the fact that he said he sold the shares of pipeline parent company Energy Transfer Partners in the summer of 2016. The White House has not confirmed whether he still owns the Phillips 66 shares, so that does remain a question mark. A Trump spokesman we contacted did not answer our questions about those shares. In any event, the headline suggests that Trump dumped a bunch of money into the pipeline and then approved its construction, ostensibly to make a big profit from it. The timeline doesn’t support that. Trump said in December 2016, before his inauguration, that he would restart pipeline construction. He didn’t have any actual power to do so until Jan. 20, 2017, well after he sold his Energy Transfer Partners stock. He did sign an executive action on Jan. 24 to get the pipeline moving again. Construction resumed on Feb. 9, and the Standing Rock Sioux tribe challenged the pipeline in court on Feb. 14. The headline’s assertion that Trump was caught in some kind of wrongdoing by investing in the pipeline before approving it is wrong and misleading. The potential conflict of interest was known and at least partially addressed before Trump became president and restarted the project. We rate the headline False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e31293f2-6a2f-4526-ba69-4a03895ea482	None	LearnProgress.org	None	None	None	2017-02-16T16:42:59	2017-02-08	['None']
pomt-09503	"Mayor White has major stake in Barnett Shale production company."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/feb/22/farouk-shami/shami-says-white-has-major-stake-barnett-shale-dri/	Gubernatorial hopeful Bill White doesn’t shy away from energy issues — after all, he was mayor of Houston, a city that many oil and gas companies call home, and was deputy energy secretary for about two years during the Clinton administration. More unusual by Houston — and Texas — standards, White touts initiatives undertaken during his six years as mayor to reduce the amount of toxic chemicals emitted by Houston's petrochemical industries. But now Farouk Shami, White's leading Democratic opponent, is trying to use an energy issue against the former mayor, touching on concerns among residents and officials about the environmental and health effects of drilling in populated areas of the Barnett Shale, a natural gas field that stretches west and south from Dallas and covers more than 20 counties. Shami released a statement Feb. 9 with this headline: "Mayor White Has Major Stake in Barnett Shale Production Company." In it, Shami concluded that "it's a conflict of interest at best and utter hypocrisy at worst." First things first. Is White really connected to a company drilling for natural gas in the Barnett Shale? Shami’s statement links White to the drilling through the former mayor’s ownership of stock in Exxon Mobil Corp., based in Irving. The oil giant is in the process of buying Fort Worth-based XTO Energy Inc., one of the leading producers of gas in the Barnett Shale. XTO says on its Web site that the area accounts for more than 20 percent of its total oil and natural gas production, and it has plans to expand its drilling there. Shami's press release says White "has at least $2.2 million invested in oil and gas stocks, with a substantial position in the giant Exxon Mobile" (sic). Asked how it calculated the size of White's investment, Shami's campaign provided a chart based on a federal financial disclosure form White filed in May 2009 when he was a candidate for the U.S. Senate. The campaign counted 14 energy companies in White’s portfolio during 2008, including Exxon and ConocoPhillips. Then it added up the reported values of White’s energy stock holdings. Therein lies a problem. Instead of exact dollar amounts, the disclosure form lists a range of values for each stock, and some are pretty wide. For example, the reported value of White’s investment in BJ Services Co., an oil and gas services company on whose board he sits, is between $500,001 and $1 million – a difference of a half-million dollars. Totaling the high numbers yields $2.2 million; using the low numbers, $1 million. In text with the chart, the Shami campaign used different language from the press release, which states that White has "at least $2.2 million" invested in oil and gas companies. The chart wording states White has "as much as" that amount. A more definitive measure of White's holdings came from his campaign, which said his oil and gas stocks were worth $1.1 million to $1.3 million in 2009. They are in several accounts personally managed by White and account for about 25 percent of his total portfolio. The White campaign said the candidate has owned Exxon stock for more than five years and disclosed to us the number (700) and value (about $45,000) of the shares. Since Exxon is valued at about $310 billion, White owns far less than 1 percent — a figure that Katy Bacon, a spokeswoman for the White campaign, suggested does not constitute the "substantial position" in Exxon that Shami claims. Besides, Exxon’s $31 billion purchase of XTO, announced in December, is still pending, subject to approval by XTO stockholders and the Federal Trade Commission. That means that as of right now, owning stock in Exxon does not equal owning stock in XTO. However, we discovered White does have an interest in Barnett Shale drilling through another company in his portfolio. According to the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the exploration and production of oil and natural gas, ConocoPhillips — in which White reported owning stock valued between $100,001 and $250,000 in 2008 — is currently active in the Barnett Shale through a subsidiary, Burlington Resources. So much for assessing White's stake in the Barnett Shale. A more problematic issue is whether the investments constitute a conflict of interest, as Shami claims. During the debate, both Shami and a reporter asked White whether he supported a proposed moratorium on new drilling in the Barnett Shale. White said he did not, arguing that emissions and other violations should be addressed on a case-by-case basis. "I think it would be unfair to shut down operations of all operators based on what some operators do," he said. In the news release, Shami, who is in favor of a moratorium, says that "it’s disturbing to think Mayor White’s conflict of interest could be putting people’s lives at risk." Brian Roberts, a professor of government at the University of Texas, said the ethical concerns raised by Shami are speculative and could become an issue only if White, as governor, were to participate in decisions related to oil and gas. But Roberts said the regulation of those industries largely belongs to the Railroad Commission, whose members are elected. Putting aside the conflict issue, where does this leave us? Shami is correct that White has a financial interest in Exxon, as well as other oil and gas companies. And it's true that Exxon is acquiring XTO, a $27 billion company that's a big player in the Barnett Shale. But Shami's assertion that White's $45,000 investment in Exxon constitutes a "major stake" in XTO is off the mark. Though we found that White has a larger interest in ConocoPhillips, which owns another company drilling in the Barnett Shale, that too is a tiny piece of a multinational oil company's action. We rate Shami's statement as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00285	"Joe Manchin has a ‘D' rating from the NRA."	mostly true	/west-virginia/statements/2018/sep/28/patrick-morrisey/does-joe-manchin-have-d-rating-national-rifle-asso/	Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate seeking to oust U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., is attacking Manchin for not being a big enough advocate for gun rights. In the Sept. 7 tweet, Morrisey said, "Joe Manchin has a "D" rating from the NRA, and fought alongside Obama and Schumer for anti-gun legislation." The NRA is the National Rifle Association, the nation’s largest gun-rights group, while Obama is former President Barack Obama and Schumer is Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Here, we’ll focus on the NRA rating for Manchin. In a news release, the NRA said Manchin has earned a D rating from the group this year. In the same news release, the group said it was endorsing Morrisey and airing ads on his behalf in the Charleston and Bluefield markets. "Contrary to what Joe Manchin says in West Virginia, he has supported the agenda of Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer by voting in favor of gun control in Washington, D.C.," said Chris Cox, chairman of the NRA Political Victory Fund. So it’s clear that the NRA has given Manchin a D rating this year. But the group hasn’t always been so negative about Manchin -- something the ad glosses over. In 2004, when Manchin was running for governor, he received an "A+" rating from the NRA and received the group’s endorsement when running for governor. And in 2010 and 2012, when Manchin was running for a U.S. Senate seat, he was endorsed by the NRA and received an "A" rating. "Joe Manchin is committed to protecting the Right to Keep and Bear Arms guaranteed to all Americans," Cox wrote in 2012. Manchin’s relations with the NRA soured in 2013 after he and Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., proposed legislation that would have enacted tighter background checks for certain gun purchases. The NRA Political Victory Fund website doesn’t allow for searches of past ratings, although it once did, the Washington Post reported in June 2018. Asked by the Post for the rationale for removing past grades, Jennifer Baker, an NRA spokeswoman, said, "I don’t understand — why are you asking? What does it matter to you? The grades are not relevant after the election." Our ruling Morrisey tweeted that "Joe Manchin has a ‘D’ rating from the NRA." That’s certainly the case for 2018, and the NRA has endorsed Morrisey over Manchin this year. But this ignores that in previous campaigns, Manchin received ‘A’ and ‘A+’ ratings from the NRA and won the group’s endorsement those years. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Patrick Morrisey	None	None	None	2018-09-28T09:38:02	2018-09-07	['None']
pomt-05381	Each U.S. House member who voted to overhaul Social Security in 1983 was re-elected.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/may/08/saxby-chambliss/senator-praises-reagan-era-social-security-push-bi/	U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, bemoaning the lack of bipartisanship in Congress, recently told a story to emphasize the benefits of Democrats and Republicans working together. The Georgia Republican went back to the early 1980s to make his case, saying today’s Congress should take a similar approach of rising above politics to address major fiscal challenges such as the increasing costs of Medicaid and Medicare. "What I always found is if you look back at [former Republican President] Ronald Reagan and [former Democratic House Speaker] Tip O’Neill, they raised the Social Security age, made some significant changes back there," Chambliss said last month at the Atlanta Press Club. "Boy, everybody thought that’s the political end of that Congress. Every single member of the House of Representatives who voted for that change got re-elected because they did the right thing. I just think if you do the right thing, the political side of things will take care of itself." PolitiFact Georgia was there for the senator’s speech and the question-and-answer session, where he made this particular claim. We wanted to find out whether Chambliss was right or was this a political tall tale. Chambliss is a member of the Senate’s "Gang of Six," a group of three Republicans and three Democrats that has tried to come up with federal budget solutions. The senator has taken much criticism for his participation in the effort, primarily from fiscal conservatives for his position on some ideas to reduce the nation’s multitrillion-dollar debt. Senate leadership, Chambliss said, hasn’t taken kindly to the group’s work because of -- surprise! -- politics. The "hard, tough votes" on some of these issues might hurt the future ambitions of some senators, Chambliss said. Reagan, considered by some as the father of modern conservative politics, was no fan of the Social Security system, which he saw as government run amok. When Reagan took office in 1981, federal economists warned that the system was in financial peril because of the steadily increasing number of senior citizens eligible for benefits and projections that more Americans would become future recipients. The president tried to overhaul the system. Reagan’s first plan got not one vote in the Senate, and the Democratic-led House voted against it as well. Reagan then created a bipartisan commission led by future Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to come up with solutions to keep Social Security solvent. O’Neill, a liberal from Massachusetts, appointed some members to the commission. The eventual compromise included increases in Social Security tax rates, increased benefits for disabled widows and, most importantly, a gradual increase in the eligibility age to 67 by the year 2027. The Social Security Administration’s website has a list of how each member of Congress voted on the changes in March 1983. Overwhelming majorities of House and Senate members across party lines voted in favor of the changes. But did each member who voted "Aye" on the legislation get re-elected the following year, as Chambliss said? No, according to a tally by the federal government of 1984 congressional election results. Ten House members lost in 1984 despite voting to pass the Social Security overhaul. The list included Elliott Levitas, a DeKalb County Democrat who lost to Republican Pat Swindall. Levitas, now a senior counsel in the Atlanta offices of the law firm Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton, said he pushed for Social Security reform and recalled voting in favor of changes to maintain the system’s viability. He said it wasn’t a factor in his 1984 defeat. Reagan was. The president was re-elected in historic fashion that year (Reagan won 49 of 50 states) and had strong coattails that analysts say helped many Republicans win congressional contests in 1984. "[The Democratic ticket] was not wildly popular in this area, and Reagan was," Levitas said. In fact, all 10 House members who voted in favor of the Social Security overhaul and lost their re-election bids were Democrats. Chambliss press secretary Lauren Claffey noted that when we asked her office about the veracity of her boss’ claim. She said the senator was close; about 95 percent of the 243 House members who voted for the overhaul were re-elected. "Although not every single member that voted for Social Security reform was re-elected, it is safe to say that an overwhelming majority of those who voted for the reform were, and supports the point that Sen. Chambliss was making that ‘if you do the right thing, then the political side of it will take care of itself,’ " Claffey said via email. This was a tough call for PolitiFact Georgia. Chambliss wasn’t precisely correct when he said "every single member" of the House who voted for the overhaul was re-elected. But his overall point was correct -- most lawmakers who voted for changes to Social Security were re-elected. Nearly all of them. Our rating: Half True.

pomt-10475	If the U.S. stops adding to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, it "will lessen worldwide demand for oil" and reduce prices.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/16/john-mccain/not-enough-to-matter/	If only it were that easy. With gas prices above $3 per gallon and voters complaining that energy prices are squeezing them from every direction, Sen. John McCain, the de facto Republican nominee for president, is offering a salve based on Economics 101, the rule of supply and demand: If elected, he'll stop filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to reduce demand and ease prices. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve, or SPR, is the nation's government-owned stockpile of crude oil. It is stored in a series of salt caverns in Texas and Louisiana and currently holds about 700-million barrels of oil, enough to replace the nation's oil imports for about 60 days. President Bush supports expanding the reserve to 1-billion barrels in the next decade. "Right now I think we should stop adding to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve," McCain said at a small business roundtable in Brooklyn, N.Y., on April 10. "The SPR is intended to offset the impact of physical disruption of oil supplies. "But with oil at over $100 a barrel and an adequate supply in the SPR, it is time to suspend purchases. This will lessen worldwide demand for oil, and if the classic laws of supply and demand hold, we should see a welcome decrease in the price of oil." Well, kind of. The problem is, the SPR doesn't buy enough oil to make a significant dent in oil supplies or prices, experts say. The Energy Information Administration, the independent, analytical arm of the U.S. Energy Department, estimates that the SPR adds, at most, $1 to $2 to the cost of a $100 barrel of oil, or as much as 4 cents to 5 cents per gallon of refined gasoline. Independent experts tend to agree. While any cut in prices may be better than nothing, it's hard to argue those pennies would equal the "welcome decrease" McCain describes with gas prices up around $3.30 per gallon. "Our analysis points out that there is a relatively minor impact, maybe a dollar or two at most per barrel, out of $100-plus per barrel," said Doug McIntyre, a senior oil market analyst at the Energy Information Administration in Washington. "I'm sure everyone would love to find something they could change and immediately make prices drop $20 a barrel, regardless of the (political) party. Our analysis is, this isn't the magic bullet that some would like it to be." Congress created the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in response to the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo to protect the economy in case of another disruption to oil imports. It has steadily expanded over the years, and was growing by as much as 300,000 barrels per day during the Reagan administration. The government currently adds to the reserve by about 70,000 barrels of crude oil per day, less than one-half of 1 percent of the 20.6-million barrels the United States uses daily. So while it does increase demand, it does so by a relatively small amount. Dr. A.F. Alhajji, an associate professor of economics at Ohio Northern University and an international expert on oil markets, said filling the SPR does add to costs, in part because the government creates inefficiencies in the way it fills it. "If you do the calculations, it has an impact," Alhajji said. But, he added, McCain's idea "would have a small impact. ... In an environment of increasing oil prices, people are not going to feel it, people are not going to see it." Not everyone agrees. A 2003 report by the Democratic staff of a subcommittee of the Senate Government Affairs Committee, led by Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., found that filling the SPR could have "significant market impact" because the balance between global supply and global demand is generally only several hundred thousand barrels of oil. In that context, sending 100,000 barrels a day to the SPR could affect demand, the report argued. But U.S. refineries have more oil at their disposal than they are processing right now, so making more available would not necessarily put more gasoline into the market and cut costs. Plus, McIntyre said the government's purchase schedule is well known, "so the market should be able to account for it fairly easily." The oil market also is complex. It is influenced by a variety of factors, including current demand, expected demand, available stockpiles and, of course, global and domestic politics. That makes it difficult to determine exactly how gas prices would truly be affected if the government stopped adding to the reserve, but experts doubt it would be significant. A Congressional Research Service report from 2005 also was skeptical. "The effect of any change in fill policy on gasoline prices would depend on a number of factors — refiners' access to SPR crude, available refining capacity to manufacture gasoline meeting regional Clean Air requirements, other local conditions, and weekly reports of gasoline and other product stocks," the report said. "While prices might fall some on the heels of an announcement that SPR fill would be deferred, the adjustment might be only short-term. Gasoline and home heating oil prices might be more sensitive to reported stock levels than to reports of modest additional crude supply." Also, only about 40 percent of the cost of a gallon of gasoline comes from the price of crude oil, so a drop (or rise) in oil prices and doesn't necessarily mean a corresponding drop (or rise) in gas prices. The reserve has been tapped in the form of sales, exchanges or loans several times over the years, including after Hurricane Katrina disrupted oil production and imports on the Gulf Coast in 2005 and after Hurricane Ivan struck the Gulf Coast in 2004. In 1996, sales from the reserve were used to raise money. In April 1996, President Clinton released 12-million barrels to blunt a rise in crude oil prices. Filling the reserve also was suspended after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, and again in 1994 to save money. We find that while McCain is correct in principle, he grossly overstates the potential impact of his idea. Drivers would see little change in the price at the pump if the government stopped buying oil for the Strategic Reserve. We rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11521	"Trump declares globalist Soros as ‘national security threat’ using Obama’s 2014 executive order."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/feb/19/conservative-daily-post/no-trump-did-not-declare-george-soros-security-thr/	A hoax circulating on the Internet claims that President Donald Trump had enough with billionaire liberal George Soros and contacted Russia for a file on him. "Trump declares globalist Soros as ‘national security threat’ using Obama’s 2014 executive order," stated a Jan. 30 headline on the Conservative Daily Post. There is no evidence that Trump took any such action against Soros. The same story has been picked up by multiple websites. The Hungarian-born Soros is a hedge fund manager who has supported liberal causes and backed Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Soros has been a major critic of Trump. After Trump won, Soros called him "a con artist and would-be dictator." At a speech in Davos, Switzerland, in January, Soros said, "I consider the Trump administration a danger to the world." Soros has been the target of many online hoaxes, including that his foundations were banned from Austria and false smears, for example that he instigated racial protests in Charlottesville. Soros, who is Jewish, has also been falsely accused of being a Nazi collaborator. In this case, the story said Trump had placed a call to Russia to ask about files related to Soros. The story said Trump used a 2014 executive order by Obama to take such action. That executive order was real, stating that Obama declared a national emergency to deal with the threat of people undermining democracy in Ukraine. However, there is no evidence that Trump used that order to label Soros a threat to national security. Soros has been involved in Ukraine for decades and said he established a foundation there before it declared independence from the Russia. His International Renaissance Foundation has invested tens of millions in "Ukrainian NGOs, sponsored conferences, scholarships, human-rights confabs and investigative journalists," the National Post reported in 2015. In 2015, Soros called on the west to inject $50 billion in Ukraine. Adrian Karatnycky, an expert on Ukraine and nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, which promotes engagement in international affairs, said in general Soros is viewed as a positive figure in Ukraine. "He is not overtly in step with a particular political party and political movement," he said. "His foundation is pretty sober-minded, reasonably well regarded in Ukraine." We emailed the Conservative Daily Post and did not get a reply. The Las Vegas-based website states that it "thrives on independent journalism and truth;" however, the story about Soros is not based in evidence. We found no proof that Trump declared Obama a "national security threat." We rate this story Pants on Fire.

pomt-09926	"Why do we have automatic citizenship upon birth? We're the only country in the world that has it."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/19/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-claims-us-only-country-automatic-citize/	On his June 10, 2009, Fox News program, host Glenn Beck raised an immigration hot button that has gained some legislative traction in recent months: the issue of whether the United States ought to continue to grant citizenship to any child born in the country, even if the parents are illegal immigrants. "You know, the anchor baby thing has always really hacked me off," Beck said. "You know the anchor baby. You know what that is. It's when a child that is born here, becomes a citizen and they help the illegal parents become citizens, right?" He continued, sarcastically, "Remember empathy. Oh, empathy. No one wants to separate that family. Oh, that baby is a child. It's an anchor. It's an anchor to stay here." "Why do we have automatic citizenship upon birth?" Beck asked. "Do you know? We're the only country in the world that has it. Why?" Beck went on to explain that the 14th amendment granting citizenship to "all persons born or naturalized in the United States" was drafted after the Civil War "to protect newly freed slaves and their children and guarantee their rights as citizens. Last I checked, I don't think we're having that problem anymore. Can we have some common sense?" Beck touches on an issue that has caught the attention of a growing number of Republicans in Congress. In April, Rep. Nathan Deal, a Republican candidate for governor of Georgia, proposed H.R. 1868, the Birthright Citizenship Act of 2009. It seeks to amend immigration law so that babies born in the United States would only be granted U.S. citizenship if one of the parents is 1) a U.S. citizen or national; 2) a legal permanent resident of the United States; or 3) is serving in the U.S. armed forces. The bill currently has 77 cosponsors, 76 Republicans and one Democrat. Every year, about 400,000 babies are born to mothers who are undocumented immigrants in the United States, acccording to Jon Feere, a legal policy analyst at the Center for Immigration Studies. Once those children become adults, they can sponsor their parents or extended family for legal permanent residency. Our aim is not to enter the fray over the proposed legislation but to check Beck's claim that the United States is the only country in the world that grants automatic citizenship to anyone born in the country. And to that end, we refer to a report from NumbersUSA, a group dedicated to reducing immigration levels, and which backs Deal's bill. They found that in addition to the United States, there are 33 countries that offer automatic, unconditional citizenship to children born within their borders. They offer several qualifiers. No European nations grant birthright citizenship (but we note that Romania is on the list). Canada is the only developed nation other than the United States. No nation in the group other than the United States has more than 200 million people. Only the United States, Pakistan and Mexico have 50 million or more. For the full list, go here . By way of reminder, Beck said, "We're the only country in the world that has it." We might be inclined to cut Beck some slack if the only other countries were Saint Lucia, Antigua and Lesotho. In fact, we'll even admit that we had to look up what continent Lesotho is even on (Africa). But Canada, Brazil, Romania? We didn't have to go looking for those. It might be surprising to Americans that automatic citizenship isn't more common in the developed world, but the bottom line is Beck made a blanket statement that is just wrong. We rate his statement False.	None	Glenn Beck	None	None	None	2009-06-19T13:50:53	2009-06-10	['None']
pomt-04123	Ohio's judges, "compared to other similar states, are being woefully underpaid."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2013/jan/09/bill-seitz/bill-seitz-says-ohios-judges-are-woefully-underpai/	Ohio's 129th General Assembly ended its two-year session in December after acting on dozens of measures during a busy, post-election lame-duck period. One proposal that never reached consideration as legislation, however, was a plan to give a cost-of-living pay increase to state and local elected officials. Sen. Bill Seitz, a Republican from Cincinnati, pushed for an increase that would have taken effect Jan. 1, 2014, if the legislature appropriated enough money in the next biennial budget to cover the cost. Seitz, who had earlier supported raises for judges, noted that judges, legislators, county commissioners, sheriffs, prosecutors and other elected officials have had no increase in pay since January 2008. Those increases were the result of a bill, passed by the legislature in 2000, which enacted pay raises for the next eight years equal to the consumer price index or 3 percent. "This is the price you pay to get qualified people to do consequential things," Seitz told the Columbus Dispatch. "Study after study has shown that our judges, compared to other similar states, are being woefully underpaid." Senate President Tom Niehaus and House Speaker Bill Batchelder let Seitz's proposal die in caucus, but PolitiFact Ohio was still interested in his statement about the comparatively low level of judicial pay. We called Seitz's office to ask for background. They didn't get back to us during a holiday week, but our own search turned up several supporting sources. Chief among them was the "Survey of Judicial Salaries," which has been published annually for nearly 30 years by the National Center for State Courts. The most recent survey, published last July, found that Ohio ranked 41st among the 50 states in average pay for common pleas judges, or general jurisdiction trial courts. The national average pay for common pleas judge was $137,000 in 2011, compared to $121,350 in Ohio. Ohio's Supreme Court ranked 33rd in pay, with an annual salary of $141,600. The pay for Ohio’s appellate judges ranked 30th, at $132,000. That put Ohio in the bottom half for each category, according to the NCSC, which noted that Ohio judges have not had a raise since 2008. (Salaries for full-time municipal court judges are $114,100 while part-time municipal court judges and county court judges have annual salaries of $65,650.) A 2011 report from the Ohio Judicial Conference found that the pay for judges at the Supreme Court, appeals courts and common pleas courts in Ohio was below pay levels in the "peer states" of Illinois, Michigan, New York and Pennsylvania. And a 2011 analysis from the NCSC on judicial pay in Massachusetts included what it called the "startling" finding that judges' salaries in the Bay State "fare worse than every other industrial state except Ohio." What's the verdict on Seitz’s statement? Saying that Ohio's judges are "woefully underpaid" is a matter of opinion that PolitiFact Ohio can't rate. That’s a point for clarification. But Seitz was accurate in asserting that Ohio's judges are paid less "compared to other similar states." They are, in fact, paid less at every level than are judges in most other states. On the Truth-O-Meter, his statement rates Mostly True.	None	Bill Seitz	None	None	None	2013-01-09T06:00:00	2013-01-10	['Ohio']
pomt-11432	The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that public school in the United States "will not teach the tenets of Islam or Sharia Law."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/15/nowtrumpcom/no-supreme-court-didnt-ban-sharia-law-schools/	A viral story said that the U.S. Supreme Court sided with President Donald Trump and ruled that public schools will not teach Sharia law. "Breaking: Supreme Court sides with Trump - this changes everything!" said a March 9 headline on Nowtrump.com, a pro-Trump fake news website. The story said that the court ruled that public school in the United States "will not teach the tenets of Islam or Sharia Law." We found that this story recycles misinformation from 2017 about a court ruling that doesn’t exist. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The story said that on behalf of the U.S. Education Department, Trump’s legal team petitioned the court to make America safer. The Supreme Court ruled 5-3 that public schools "will not teach the tenets of Islam or Sharia Law." However, Nowtrump.com (a play on the "never Trump" movement) wrote that according to USA Politics Today, students will learn about Islam, as they do about other religions, in history. (Snopes fact-checked the USA Politics Today story in 2017, which is similar to the Nowtrump story.) The Nowtrump.com story then made up inflammatory quotes by Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch. "We certainly shouldn’t be filling the children with lies about Islam being a ‘religion of peace’ when they see the carnage on the news almost every day," Gorsuch said, according to the article. We found no actual quote by Gorsuch, and the timing of the alleged court ruling makes no sense based on when Gorsuch joined the court. FactCheck.org fact-checked a similar story on another website on April 11, 2017, and noted that Gorsuch didn’t hear his first case until April 17 -- about a week after the fake news story first appeared. It is worth noting that public schools can teach about religion, according to a 1963 U.S. Supreme Court ruling. In Abington vs. Schempp, Associate Justice Tom Clark wrote for the court: "It might well be said that one’s education is not complete without a study of comparative religion or the history of religion and its relationship to the advancement of civilization. It certainly may be said that the Bible is worthy of study for its literary and historic qualities. Nothing we have said here indicates that such study of the Bible or of religion, when presented objectively as part of a secular program of education may not be effected consistently with the First Amendment." Nowtrump.com wrote that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that public school in the United States "will not teach the tenets of Islam or Sharia Law." There has been no such ruling banning schools from teaching about Islam or Sharia law. The story includes made-up quotes by Gorsuch. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-01765	"I'm not a conspiracy theorist and I never allow conspiracy theorists on my program."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/30/peter-lavelle/rts-peter-lavelle-says-he-doesnt-allow-conspiracy-/	Peter Lavelle hosts CrossTalk on RT, an English language cable news network funded by the Russian government. Lavelle opens each edition of CrossTalk by saying it’s a place "where all things are considered." Everything except, he says, conspiracy theories. Lavelle’s commentary on Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 thrust him into the media spotlight with a contentious, 10-minute interview with CNN’s Chris Cuomo, who accused Lavelle of being obsessed with "clearing Russia from culpability" in the plane’s shooting. American officials have said the plane was likely shot down by Ukrainian separatists in Donetsk with a surface-to-air missile. Lavelle, an American who works as a journalist in Moscow, says the United States is too quick to tie Russian-backed rebels to the tragedy, berating the U.S. State Department for relying on social media as evidence for its claims and not looking at Ukraine as a responsible party. "I'm not a conspiracy theorist and I never allow conspiracy theorists on my program," Lavelle said on the July 23 CrossTalk, addressing guest Vladimir Suchan. Then Lavelle proposed a theory that involves Ukraine bringing down the plane in effort to earn worldwide sympathy amid woes with its new government. "But if I look at the timing of this tragedy in Ukraine, the (Petro) Poroshenko government was, well, in trouble with its latest offensive in the east, it was losing badly, soldiers were being circled, it was really bad news," Lavelle said. "And all of a sudden we have this tragedy of killing civilians on this flight, and this puts Ukraine back on the front page, it competes with Gaza, a lot of ‘sympathy,’ for the Kiev regime, this is good timing in a way for the coup regime that hasn't been achieving too many successes since February." Um, so in essence Lavelle is suggesting Ukraine shot down MH 17 so it could blame the Russian separatists so the flailing Ukraine government could become front-and-center again in the news? Sounds like a conspiracy theory to us. But so that we don’t be accused of reaching a Pants on Fire conclusion too quickly, we decided to search around Lavelle’s other shows. We didn’t search every program, but we looked at enough to find that conspiracy theories are very much raised by Lavelle and featured on his show. RT is a curiosity for Western journalists, some of whom see its coverage as Kremlin-directed propaganda. As a star host, Lavelle has gotten and dismissed questions about the network's perceived bias. In 2008, he told a New York Times reporter, "No one is telling me what to say." He did, however, note that part of the network's "mission is public relations." RT has also carved out a reputation for bringing in obscure guests to discuss unusual topics related to America, devoting time to questioning President Barack Obama’s birth certificate. Lavelle, too, has expressed his preference to be "counterintuitive" compared to corporate-owned American cable news networks. In a 2010 interview with Columbia Journalism Review, Lavelle said, "Being mainstream has been very dangerous for the West." Here’s a few of those conspiratorial, er, counterintuitive moments that we found with a simple Google search. Conspiracy No. 1: 9/11 was an inside job Lavelle invited several skeptics of the American government's Sept. 11 findings "to try to find out what really happened" on 9/11 for a March 2010 segment. The roster included Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth founder Richard Gage, who said three World Trade Center skyscrapers (the Twin Towers and a surrounding WTC building) that collapsed that day "were brought down by explosive demolition on 9/11, not by fire and jet plane impacts." Lavelle also asked blogger Ian Henshall, a blogger and author of 9/11 Revealed: The New Evidence, about what it's like to be called a conspiracy theorist when he's just raising questions. "Conspiracy theory, if it means anything, is a simple story which you know claims to explain a major complicated event. That is exactly what the official story of the 9/11 attacks is," Henshall said. "Very simple story, all organized by a guy in the cave with 17 hijackers who were just incredibly lucky. You could not get more of a conspiracy theory than that." Henshall went on to talk about the "worrying evidence" that the towers-takedown was an inside job. Just so we don't raise the eyebrows of conspiracy theorists, we took three screengrabs of Lavelle and his guests talking about 9/11 conspiracy theories from RT's YouTube page: 1. "WTC towers collapsed due to a controlled demolition;" 2. "Attacks an inside job to justify wars in Afghanistan and Iraq;" 3. "9/11 attacks in 2001 were intentionally allowed to happen." It wasn't the first time Lavelle raised eyebrows about the official story of Sept. 11. In February 2010, Lavelle posited on CrossTalk that the Sept. 11 hijackers were "not even fundamentalists at all" -- much to the shock of the two people he was interviewing about a proposed burqa ban in France. This time he was challenged by a guest, former British journalist Douglas Murray of the Centre for Social Adhesion, who asked Lavelle, "How can you keep speaking, let alone hosting a show, and know so little? How can you know so little and keep on talking?" Murray detailed the appearance on the "strange propaganda outfit" in a blogpost. The other guest, Anne-Elisabeth Moutet of the Jean-Jacques Rousseau Institute, said al-Qaida is a completely fundamentalist group. Conspiracy No. 2: AIDS drugs kill people with AIDS Lavelle later convened a panel to talk about the business of HIV/AIDS on July 21, 2010, asking questions that highlighted critics of antiretroviral therapy for people infected with HIV who say the treatments are nothing but a "huge moneybag" for Big Pharma. Lavelle invited on guest Peter Duesberg, a University of California-Berkeley professor of molecular and cell biology, who believes that AIDS treatments are killing people infected with "the so-called AIDS virus, which doesn’t do anything." So AIDS isn’t killing people, AIDS drugs are. "The companies try to treat the virus that doesn’t do anything with drugs that are inevitably toxic," Duesberg said. "The AZT was developed 40 years ago for one purpose: to kill human cells for cancer, chemotherapy. And the result is they have never ever cured one AIDS patient." Lavelle asked Dr. Denis Broun of UNAIDS for feedback. "We have 2 million people die of HIV infection every year. And these are not people who die of old age, I can tell you that. The average age of people who die in Russia is 32 years. This is preposterous," Broun said. "The antiretrovirals are keeping people alive, and people are staying alive thanks to administration of these products." Lavelle went back to Duesberg, who said the world’s 30-40 million HIV-infected population is doing well and the people who die are the ones "getting these drugs that are inevitably toxic." ‘They are designed to terminate DNA synthesis, that’s the central molecule of life, you’re dying from that," Duesberg said. "That is AIDS by prescription. And 500,000 people are prescribed these drugs alone in the U.S. and all of them die, about half of them die from diseases that have nothing to do with HIV." Another guest, Steve Caterer of Global Pharma Insights, said Duesberg’s opinions "on the good side are disrespectful and on the worst side are tantamount to murder." Later in the program, Broun said the three-drug HIV/AIDS drug treatment used today is much less toxic than the AZT-only treatment (azidothymidine) used 25 years ago. "No one in his right sense is suggesting to use AZT alone today," he said. "It's as if people were suggesting to treat syphilis with arsenic, as was done at the beginning of the century. ... We cannot discuss today's situation with antique data that are no longer valid in any way." Broun said researchers debate some points of treating the virus, but "no one is saying, like denying the role of HIV in creating AIDS or saying the drugs are dangerous for people." Conspiracy No. 3: U.S. official planned to break up Ukraine Back to Ukraine, where Lavelle lambasted American media coverage of the "Western-induced crisis" in May 2014, and claimed that Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland was trying to break up Ukraine. "It seems to me that there’s this habit now in Western media, particularly in the United States, that no one wants to see fault in themselves or their own governments here. Because this was so predictable, as you said at the beginning of the program, this plan that Victoria Nuland had was just nonsense. She was just going to break up the country, but they had a Plan B. If they don’t succeed, then Russia is a very easy enemy to blame everything on, and that’s exactly what we’re seeing right now." Even guest Dmitry Babich, an employee of the Russian-government owned radio station The Voice of Russia, thought Lavelle was going a bit too far. "I don’t think Victoria Nuland planned to break up the country. She thought that the east of Ukraine would just submit to the new government, the new government would be pro-Western, then as the Western media said, we should all take deep breath and then wait until Ukraine becomes completely anti-Russian," Babich said. "And of course Victoria Nuland, just like John Kerry, they don’t know a thing about Ukraine." Nuland became a notorious figure in the East as U.S. diplomats responded to Ukraine's political crisis, but there's no evidence she had a plan to break up Ukraine. A phone conversation between Nuland and U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt about Ukraine's next steps was leaked, in which she was heard as saying "F--- the EU." Routine remarks from Nuland about the United States' investment in pro-democracy initiatives in Ukraine since it broke off from the Soviet Union in 1991 were widely misconstrued on social media and by RT, which held up her comments as evidence that the U.S. was spending $5 billion to incite the riots (a claim we rated Pants on Fire). Our ruling "Never" is a strong word, yet Lavelle claimed he is a not a conspiracy theorist and has "never allowed a conspiracy theorist on his show." We’ll agree there is a somewhat subjective definition of what constitutes a conspiracy theory. But we think of the four we quickly found -- Ukraine downed MH 17 to drum up sympathy, AIDS drugs are what are killings AIDS patients, 9/11 was an inside job, and an assistant secretary of state devised a plan to break-up Ukraine -- at least one would fit most people’s definition of a conspiracy theory. Lavelle’s hypothesis about MH 17, we should note, was uttered in the breaths after saying he doesn’t allow conspiracy theories on his show. We rate his statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-05493	Says his Texas election fraud investigations have resulted in 50 convictions.	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/apr/17/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-claims-50-election-fraud-convictions-2/	Texas’ attorney general, Greg Abbott, says he needs the state’s stalled voter identification mandate to ward off fraud at the polls. When the U.S. Justice Department rejected the Texas voter ID law March 12, 2012, preventing it from taking effect, Abbott issued a press release saying: "Since 2002 ... election fraud investigations by the Texas Attorney General's Office have resulted in 50 convictions." We asked Abbott’s office for backup on his statement, and spokesman Jerry Strickland sent a list of 57 election fraud prosecutions, as well as documents showing how the cases were resolved. We also asked how many election fraud cases had been referred to the attorney general’s office since 2002. Abbott’s list shows 311 accusations of election fraud spanning 2002-12. The 57 investigations we’re checking represent only those cases that were both prosecuted and resolved. Six of the prosecutions ended in dismissal or acquittal, Strickland told us by telephone, leaving 51 prosecutions that resulted in convictions. By our analysis, three-quarters of the cases involved election code violations classified as "illegal voting" -- which includes acts such as voting more than once, impersonating a voter or voting despite ineligibility -- and "method of returning marked ballot," often meaning the defendant was accused of having someone else’s ballot. Only two cases are described as "voter impersonation" on the list. Whether voter impersonation is a standing problem has been a hot button in the state’s legislative debates over proposed voter ID laws in 2005, 2007, 2009 and 2011; Austin American-Statesman news stories say legislators mostly split along party lines, with Democrats claiming impersonation is rare and Republicans claiming the problem is significant. Abbott drew criticism in 2006 for creating a special unit to target voter fraud that by mid-2008 had yielded, according to a May 19, 2008, Associated Press news story, only 26 prosecutions. Looking at all 57 election fraud prosecutions from 2002 to 2012, we tallied up the resolutions (some had multiple outcomes, when charges were pursued as separate cases): Specified as convictions: 26 Guilty plea resulting in conviction: 2 Deferred adjudication: 19 Pre-trial diversion: 10 Acquitted: 2 Dismissed: 4 For clarification of the middle two categories, we turned to the Texas District and County Attorneys Association, an Austin-based nonprofit that provides continuing legal education and technical assistance to prosecutors. The group’s executive director, Rob Kepple, told us in an interview that although deferred adjudication falls short of a conviction, he would not consider it a stretch to classify it with the convictions. In deferred adjudication, Kepple said, the defendant pleads guilty, and then "the court defers any finding of guilt and places you on probation or community supervision." If the terms are met, the case is dismissed -- but it remains on the defendant’s record, he said. This means it can carry the weight of a conviction in later cases, Kepple said. For example, if a person is given deferred adjudication in a domestic violence case and then later is charged again with domestic violence, he said, the adjudication counts as the first offense, making the new charge a second offense. But a pre-trial diversion is not a conviction, he said. There’s not even necessarily a guilty plea or admission of guilt. "Basically, they sat down with the defendant and say, ‘Here’s what’s going to happen. You agree not to mess up for 12 months and we’ll just dismiss the case.’ So in no common parlance can this be considered a conviction," Kepple said. The case can even be expunged from the defendant’s record, he said. "There’s no way you can mistake a pre-trial diversion for a conviction, I don’t think." We also consulted the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association, a group that provides support and education for its members. Like Kepple, the association’s capital assistance attorney, Rick Wardroup, pointed out via email that the final outcome of a pre-trial diversion or deferred adjudication depends on whether the defendant meets the terms of their probation or supervision. Abbott spokeswoman Lauren Bean told us by telephone that the attorney general counts pre-trial diversions as a successful outcome for two main reasons: First, although the defendants do not plead guilty, such agreements are made in order to avoid an expected criminal trial, and second, because the defendant receives a punishment. After we shared our findings with her, Bean sent us another bit of backup: a section of Texas local government code on court costs that classes deferred adjudication and pre-trial diversions with convictions. University of Texas law school assistant professor Jennifer Laurin told us via email that clauses like this in state laws indicate the reverse -- they illustrate that these two outcomes are not normally considered convictions. And Kepple said, "That section is the definition of ‘conviction’ for the purpose of collecting fines and fees. But in common parlance, a deferred prosecution and deferred adjudications simply are not criminal convictions." Our ruling Abbott’s statement refers to 50 "convictions," which he might better have termed "satisfactory results." It looks to us like 60 percent of his cited "convictions" were not convictions. We recognize, though, that our analysis presumes that all the non-convicted defendants fulfilled or will fulfill all terms of the agreements they made to avoid going to trial. That may not be so. On balance, we rate Abbott’s claim Half True.	None	Greg Abbott	None	None	None	2012-04-17T15:38:20	2012-03-12	['Texas']
pomt-01740	Ed Gillespie "supports a personhood amendment."	false	/virginia/statements/2014/aug/04/mark-warner/warner-says-gillespie-supports-personhood-amendmen/	During a sharp exchange at their first debate, U.S. Sen. Mark Warner insisted that GOP challenger Ed Gillespie supports laws that would provide embryos with rights the moment of conception. "He supports a personhood amendment that is so far out of the mainstream that it would ban certain common forms of contraception," Warner, a Democrat, said during the July 26 debate. He cast Gillespie as sympathetic towards several other socially conservative policies. Gillespie protested. "This is an area where you’re making up my views," he said. "Please provide the documentation for my support of any of those things." Warner persisted, directly asking Gillespie if he ever supported a personhood amendment. "No," Gillespie said. "Provide documentation of that. When did I support a personhood amendment?" "We’ll give you the documentation," Warner replied. Shortly after the debate, his campaign put out an email saying that Gillespie was chairman of the Republican National Committee in 2004 when the party adopted a national platform calling for a personhood amendment. The platform said, "As a country, we must keep our pledge to the first guarantee of the Declaration of Independence. That is why we say the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed. We support a human life amendment to the Constitution, and we endorse legislation to make it clear that the Fourteenth Amendment’s protections apply to unborn children." As our colleagues at PolitiFact national have noted, the human life amendment would assert that legal personhood begins at conception and with it, constitutional protection. Personhood legislation has drawn enormous debate in Virginia and across the nation. Supporters say the laws provide a legal remedy if an unborn child is killed by neglect or a third party. Opponents say the measures are a ruse to challenge rights to abortion and contraceptives that could prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in a uterus. Gillespie "had an understanding of the platform, and what was in it," said David Turner, Warner’s campaign spokesman. "He was chair of the RNC and on the platform committee that crafted the language." Gillespie was RNC chairman from 2003 to 2005. We should note that GOP has adopted platforms calling for a human life amendment at each of its national conventions since 1984, according to records kept by the American Presidency Project at the University of California at Santa Barbara. All this is in the past, however. Warner’s statement was in the present tense. He said Gillespie "supports a personhood amendment." Turner shifted to 2014 by pointing to the National Right to Life’s endorsement of Gillespie in May. The anti-abortion group said Gillespie, when he was RNC chairman, "worked closely with pro-life leaders to ensure the platform remained resolute in seeking to restore legal protection to unborn children threatened by abortion…" We repeatedly asked officials at National Right to Life group to specify actions Gillespie took to ensure the GOP stood hard on a personhood amendment but didn’t receive a direct answer. Turner noted that Gillespie tweeted news of his Right to Life endorsement. "By touting a release that specifically referenced his work on a platform that had language described as calling for a personhood amendment, he has effectively endorsed that work during this campaign," Turner emailed. Gillespie, on his website, says he’s "pro-life," and opposes taxpayer funding of abortion. He doesn’t mention a personhood amendment. Paul Logan, Gillespie’s campaign spokesman, emailed us last week that "Ed doesn’t support a personhood amendment." Our ruling Warner says Gillespie "supports a personhood amendment." Gillespie says he doesn’t and challenged the senator to prove his claim. Gillespie was certainly national GOP chairman in 2004 when the party adopted a platform supporting a human life amendment. But we haven’t seen any clear personal expression from his supporting such a law either then or now. So Warner has failed to prove his claim. We rate Warner’s statement False.

pomt-00038	Says Joe Manchin "supported Obama and Clinton's campaigns to kill coal jobs."	false	/west-virginia/statements/2018/nov/05/patrick-morrisey/did-joe-manchin-support-obama-and-clinton-efforts-/	Donald Trump Jr. tweeted his support for Republican U.S. Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey — and his opposition to Morrissey's Democratic incumbent, Sen. Joe Manchin — on Oct. 13, 2018. Trump Jr. tweeted, "Liberal Joe Manchin can’t be trusted to fight for West Virginia. He sold out Mountaineers when he supported Hillary Clinton over my father & on just about every other issue imaginable." The tweet attached a Morrissey campaign ad that included the charge that Manchin "supported Obama and Clinton’s campaigns to kill coal jobs." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Those are fighting words in coal-producing West Virginia. So we wondered whether it is accurate that Manchin supported Hillary Clinton’s and Barack Obama’s efforts to kill coal jobs. As we have previously noted, Manchin did back Clinton in the 2016 election — an endorsement that turned out to be strongly at odds with most voters in a state that voted strongly for her Republican opponent, Donald Trump. (Manchin later told Politico that his decision to stick by Clinton was "a mistake. It was a mistake politically.") But the Morrissey ad didn’t just refer to Manchin’s endorsement of the candidates. It went a step further and said that Manchin specifically supported their coal policies. And that doesn’t appear to be correct. In his initial campaign for Senate in 2010, he famously ran an ad in which he shot a copy of the cap-and-trade bill proposed by Obama and other Democrats that would have curbed emissions, potentially hurting the coal industry. (The bill was never enacted.) In an 2013 Washington Post article, Manchin said that Obama’s climate initiative -- which would have put coal at a disadvantage to other forms of energy -- amounted to a declaration of war on the coal industry. "The regulations the President wants to force on coal are not feasible. And if it’s not feasible, it’s not reasonable," Manchin said. Manchin went on to say in the article that it is not acceptable to get rid of coal. "It’s clear now that the president has declared a war on coal. It’s simply unacceptable that one of the key elements of his climate change proposal places regulations on coal that are completely impossible to meet with existing technology." He joined Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., to introduce the Affordable Reliable Energy Now Act, which the lawmakers touted as helping "rein in President Obama’s Clean Power Plan." In 2015, he emphasized his opposition to Obama’s Clean Power Plan in a letter to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy. He also urged constituents to direct their opposition to the plan at field hearings. Saying he believed that the plan would "result in escalating utility bills for Mountain State residents and even more coal mining job losses," Manchin wrote that "forcing new coal-fired plants to meet standards when experts know that the required technology is not sustainably operational on a commercial scale makes absolutely no sense. By requiring technology that has never been adequately demonstrated, the EPA is forcing an industry to shut down and consumers to pay higher utility bills." He also voted to advance a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act to reverse the "Waters of the U.S." (WOTUS) rule, arguing that it would "impact the coal mining in West Virginia." Manchin’s Senate website also examples of Manchin supporting the coal industry, such as introducing in 2018 the Fossil Energy Utilization, Enhancement, and Leadership Act, which was designed to "protect coal jobs and develop new technologies to be used domestically and exported internationally," and supporting efforts to use the Defense Production Act to protect "clean-burning, coal-fired power plants." The Morrisey campaign did not respond to repeated requests to offer examples of Manchin opposing the coal industry. Our ruling A tweet posted by Patrick Morrisey and shared by Donald Trump Jr. said that Manchin "supported Obama and Clinton's campaigns to kill coal jobs."

pomt-08877	Mortgage fraud is "up 400 percent in the last five years."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/aug/02/pam-bondi/pam-bondi-says-mortgage-fraud-400-percent/	At their first televised debate, the three Republican candidates for attorney general got a chance to address why fraud seemed to be so rampant in Florida and what they, if elected, would do to stop it. Lt. Gov. Jeff Kottkamp talked about Medicaid fraud, and how the state must do a better job recouping that money. Former Agency for Health Care Administration secretary Holly Benson talked about Florida being ranked No. 1 in terms of automobile accident fraud. Former Hillsborough prosecutor Pam Bondi then zeroed in on mortgage fraud. "Mortgage fraud is through the roof," Bondi said during the hour-long debate taped on July 31, 2010, for Bay News 9 in Tampa Bay and CFN 13 in Orlando and broadcast the following day. "It's up 400 percent in the last five years. That's outrageous. We shouldn't have to be dealing with that." It's a simple, but staggering assertion -- and one we thought was worth exploring. First things first, Bondi's campaign told us she was referring to nationwide statistics and not just Florida. That's an important distinction because the question was related to Florida. Still, the campaign turned us to a Department of Treasury fraud report to back up her claim. Using FBI statistics, Treasury said that the FBI investigated more than 2,100 mortgage fraud cases in 2009, a 400 percent increase from five years ago (Page 7 of the report). The report, dated June 14, 2010, attributes the rise in mortgage fraud investigations to "declining economic conditions," "liberal underwriting" and "declining home values." The FBI's own report produces slightly different numbers, but a similar percentage increase. From 2005-2009, the FBI reported its mortgage fraud investigations increased from 721 to 2,794 -- a 387.5 percent increase. From 2006-2010, the pending mortgage fraud investigations are 3,029 -- which would translate to a nearly 344 percent increase over that five-year period. You can see the bureau's entire report on mortgage fraud here, which includes descriptions on current mortgage fraud scams. In a credit enhancement scheme, for example, a mortgage fraud perpetrator artificially boosts a borrower's credit to qualify him for a loan. Other types of fraud include bogus appraisals, or fake foreclosure rescue schemes. The FBI reports that mortgage fraud is particularly an issue in Florida. In 2009, the Tampa FBI field office opened more mortgage fraud investigations than any other FBI office in the country, the FBI said. Mortgage fraud investigations spiked 363 percent in Tampa in one year, according to the FBI, from 41 in 2008 to 190 in 2009. Florida also ranked first in the nation in same-day property flips, according to the FBI. (An exchange of property that occurs on the day of sale is considered suspect for illegal property flipping). U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has used the FBI data to make the case for additional resources and legislation to combat mortgage fraud, and in particular noted that FBI investigations are up "almost 400 percent from five years ago." But the FBI isn't the only agency that investigates mortgage fraud. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which is part of the Department of Treasury, collects and tracks Suspicious Activity Reports of mortgage fraud that are submitted anonymously from financial institutions across the country. The Suspicious Activity Reports are like tips, said spokesman Bill Grassano. Those tips can either lead to investigations by some 300 law enforcement agencies across the country, or help identify trends. In other cases, there was no crime. Reports of possible mortgage fraud increased from 25,931 in 2005 to 67,360 in 2009, according to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. That's a big increase, about 260 percent, but not as large as the increase in investigations reported by the FBI. We also checked in with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to see if the agency had any statewide numbers. FDLE spokeswoman Heather Smith said the agency does not track specifically the number of mortgage fraud cases statewide. Smith provided PolitiFact Florida with two FDLE mortgage fraud assessment reports, from 2005 and 2007, that use both FBI investigation figures and the Suspicious Activity Reports to highlight national trends. Back to Bondi's statement. She said mortgage fraud is up "400 percent in the last five years." Bondi has her numbers right, but the nearly 400 percent increase is referring specifically to FBI investigations of mortgage fraud nationwide, and does not account for state and local investigations, or information collected through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Bondi could have been more specific with where her figure was coming from. As such, we rate her statement Mostly True.	None	Pam Bondi	None	None	None	2010-08-02T18:24:00	2010-07-31	['None']
pomt-01460	"We have 41,000 people right now on the waitlist for financial-based assistance for our tech colleges and universities," most of them for tech schools.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/02/mary-burke/mary-burke-says-41000-people-are-waitlist-financia/	Democrat Mary Burke thinks the technical-college tuition freeze promised by Gov. Scott Walker could backfire on students. If state aid to tech schools isn’t boosted at the same time, the candidate for governor argues, a tuition freeze could force elimination of in-demand courses. Burke doesn’t rule out backing a tuition freeze herself if she wins the Nov. 4, 2014 election. But she says it’s more important to get financial support to students so they can afford to go to school -- such as by increasing state aid to keep college affordable. "The bigger issue I think is we have 41,000 people right now on the waitlist for financial-based assistance for our tech colleges and universities, and most of those people are on the waitlist for tech colleges," Burke said during a Sept. 22, 2014 interview by Wisconsin Eye. Were that many students turned down? To back her claim, Burke’s campaign pointed us to a July 31, 2014 memo prepared by the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau for state Sen. Jennifer Shilling (D-La Crosse). We also tracked down a later memo from the agency dated Aug. 19, 2014. Both memos examined Wisconsin Grants, the state-funded program that gives need-based grants to undergraduate students enrolled at least half-time in one of four sectors: UW-System institutions, tech colleges, private and nonprofit schools or tribal colleges. You must be a state resident to receive the money. All told, the state spent about $106 million in 2013-’14 on the grants. Though perhaps not as well known as federal financial aid programs, the state program helps a lot of people. At UW schools and tech schools alone, nearly 57,000 students received grants for the 2013-’14 year. UW schools receive an allotment, and the tech schools work from a separate pot of money. The average grant for a UW student was $1,775; for tech students, $994. In the tech system, it’s first-come, first-served for the grants. In the UW System, it’s first-come, first-served until each campus’ allocation is spent. In the 2013-’14 year, more than 41,000 financial aid applicants who were eligible for state help did not get any due to lack of funds, according to the Fiscal Bureau memo. More than nine out of 10 of those rejected were tech-school applicants, the memo said. The Fiscal Bureau figures are on target, according to John Reinemann, executive secretary of the Wisconsin Higher Educational Aids Board, which administers the grants, and Conor Smyth, director of Strategic Partnerships and External Relations for the Wisconsin Technical College System. Those who did not get a grant are put on a list in case they are still in school if grant money becomes available. Demand started to exceed supply of grant money during the Great Recession, when more people were returning to school for retraining and diminished incomes meant many more were eligible to receive aid. The "unmet need" reached as high as 80,000 in 2009, statistics show. The tech schools alone saw 54,000 applicants get turned down in 2012. A word about the numbers There’s somewhat less than meets the eye with the waiting list figures, however. There’s some potential -- though apparently relatively minor -- overlap between the UW System and the Wisconsin Technical College System figures. The tech schools put you on a waiting list if you are eligible for one of their awards, and you listed a tech school as the number one choice on your financial aid application. The Fiscal Bureau points out it’s not known how many of those applicants actually enroll at a tech school. They might have enrolled in a UW or private college instead -- and might even have secured a grant from one of those institutions. And while some may have done so because they didn’t get a tech-school grant, others went a different route for other reasons. This situation means the tech school list likely overstates the unmet need to some extent, Fiscal Bureau analyst Emily Pope wrote. Conversely, the UW list -- which includes only students who actually enrolled in a UW school -- likely understates it because it doesn’t include applicants who may have enrolled there if they had received a UW grant, So for all those reasons, the 41,000 waitlist figure is the best we have, but not rock solid. Our rating Burke said: "We have 41,000 people right now on the waitlist for financial-based assistance for our tech colleges and universities," most of them for tech schools. There is a large waiting list, and Burke cites a credible source on its size. But some variations in how the lists are defined by the different institutions mean the number should be treated with some caution. We rate her claim Mostly True.

pomt-01860	On the last night of the General Assembly, "by 11 o'clock 95 to 98 percent of the business was done. So we really didn't have that late-night session. We were just holding on one bill."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2014/jul/13/nicholas-mattiello/ri-speaker-nicholas-mattiello-says-legislature-did/	Some things in life are a certainty -- death, taxes and members of the Rhode Island General Assembly staying up until the early morning hours to pass a flurry of legislation on the final day of the session. On the edition of WPRI-TV's "Newsmakers" program that aired July 6, 2014, reporter Tim White was talking to House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello about the assembly session that had just ended. He noted that legislators were passing bills as late as 4 a.m. White questioned whether they had time to fully consider them before voting and asked, "Is this how you think the legislative process should happen?" Mattiello argued that the House really didn't have an all-night session this year. "We kept to our curfew every night of the last week of (the) session," he said. "Most of the business, even on the last night of the session, was concluded by, I think, roughly 11 o'clock." "The session went late because of negotiations with the Senate over a Newport Grand gambling bill. So there was that one bill," Mattiello said. "Most of the business, and I don't want to be fact-checked, but I think by 11 o'clock 95 to 98 percent of the business was done. So we really didn't have that late-night session. We were just holding on one bill." (He was referring to legislation, later signed by Governor Chafee, authorizing referenda on whether table games should be allowed at the slot parlor.) Mattiello may not have wanted to be fact-checked, but we couldn’t resist, because we had a very different recollection of a legislative day that didn't officially end until 4:06 Saturday morning. The last vote was at 3:48 in the morning. So was 95 to 98 percent of the business done by 11 p.m.? Was only one bill at issue? And did the House not really have a late-night session? When we contacted Mattiello's office, spokesman Larry Berman said in an email that "There were 126 votes taken by House members on the final day of session (June 20). Of those, 87 were made before 11 p.m." That's 69 percent, not 95 to 98 percent. However, Berman said, Mattiello was referring to new business. Most of those after-11-p.m. votes don't count, he argued, because all but one of those issues had already been debated before by the House. That's a distinction the speaker didn't make on Newsmakers. The remaining votes did consist largely of cleaning up language so House and Senate versions were identical on bills that allowed optometrists to prescribe the opiate drug hydrocodone; regulated music therapists; authorized special license plates for Olympic medal winners, and eliminated the so-called master level that provides for straight-party voting. But those are still final votes on important issues. Those votes are not insignificant. And when you don't leave the building until after 4 a.m., that's a late night. Our ruling Nicholas Mattiello said that "by 11 o'clock 95 to 98 percent of the business was done. So we really didn't have that late-night session. We were just holding on one bill." It's true that one issue -- Newport Grand and its associated bills -- was holding things up on the last night of the session. It's much less true that 95 percent of the business was done by 11 p.m. And Mattiello's suggestion that you shouldn't call a 4 a.m. adjournment a late-night session simply because most votes involved legislation that members had seen before strikes us as Pants On Fire ridiculous. His statement contains just enough truth -- the fact that one bill was at issue -- to escape having his slacks scorched. We rule it False.

pomt-12990	"In Austin, Texas, the average homeowner is paying about $1,300 to $1,400 just for recapture," meaning funds spent in non-Austin school districts.	true	/texas/statements/2016/dec/16/kirk-watson/kirk-watson-says-average-austin-homeowner-pays-130/	For years, Austin taxpayers have indirectly helped fund schools elsewhere in accord with the state’s more than 20-year-old system for equalizing aid among school districts, some of which have vast differences in taxable property wealth. Kirk Watson, the Democratic state senator from Travis County, attached an ear-catching figure to those costs during a November 2016 Texas Tribune panel discussion about hot issues in the 2017 legislative session. "In Austin, Texas," Watson said, "the average homeowner is paying about $1,300 to $1,400 just for recapture," as in funds shifted to less property-rich districts elsewhere. "And so that’s going to the state to fund state obligations. We have got to look at how we’re doing our school finance system so that we can do right by the people in this state and have a fair and equitable system." We asked Watson’s office how he arrived at his figure for how much average Austin homeowners are paying to schools elsewhere. By email, Kate Alexander said Watson relied on September 2016 testimony by the Austin school district’s chief financial officer. According to Nicole Conley's prepared remarks for a Sept. 28, 2016, appearance at a joint hearing of the Texas House committees on appropriations and public education, Conley described the Austin school district as the state’s largest single payer of recapture. "Our payment alone comprises 13 percent of all state collections," Conley’s testimony says. "During the next five years—between fiscal years 2016 and 2020—Austin ISD is projected to pay almost $2.6 billion in recapture payments to the state. By 2019, more than half of every tax dollar collected in Austin will go to the state." Later in her testimony: Conley said: "So to put it in perspective, we could lower our tax rate by 35 cents if we weren’t sending $406 million to the state under the recapture system. For the average homeowner in Austin, that would amount to about $1,400 in lower taxes. That’s fairly substantial; that’s pretty significant tax relief. That would certainly make Austin more affordable for some of our taxpayers." To our inquiry, district spokesman Jacob Barrett told us Conley reached her savings figure for the average homeowner starting from the district’s 2016-17 budget indicating it expects to pay $406 million in recapture to the state in accord with the school funding system. That payment amounts to 38 percent of the district’s $1.061 billion in budgeted property taxes, Barrett noted. Barrett said the district got to the average homeowner’s share of the budgeted recapture payment starting from its average taxable value of a home in the district of $328,844 (as of June 2016) on which such an owner expected to pay $3,548 in school maintenance and operations property taxes at the M&O tax rate of $1.079 per $100 valuation. Finally, Barrett said, multiplying the 38 percent by that $3,548 delivers the portion of taxes on an average-value residence that goes to recapture of $1,355. Barrett also emailed us a December 2012 district document showing that by amount, the Austin district's 2015 recapture payment was followed by what was paid by the Highland Park (Dallas); Eanes; Cotulla; and Karnes City districts, respectively. Also, the document says, the Austin district’s annual recapture payment is projected to exceed $630 million in 2019 when "more than half of every school property tax dollar collected locally will be ‘recaptured’ by the state." Next, we asked non-district experts--Joe Wisnoski, a former Texas Education Agency official; Tom Canby of the Texas Association of School Business Officials; and Christy Rome, who advocates for districts required to make recapture payments--to evaluate how the Austin district determined the average Austin homeowner will pay $1,355 in school property taxes toward the district’s 2016-17 recapture total. Solid, each expert said. By email, Wisnoski cautioned though: "The average doesn’t really describe much about the distribution of payment amounts, so you don’t really know how many taxpayers are clustered close to that amount, and how many are really far away (high or low) compared to the average." Finally, we looked into how much a district resident with the median value home might be paying toward its recapture total. For that, we ran the median value of homes in the Austin district as of Aug. 8, 2016--$261,487--through the district’s equation. Result: The median-value homeowner will be expected to pay $2,821 in M&O school taxes, of which $1,078 would be her or his share of the district’s recapture payment. Barrett, the district spokesman, didn’t question our math. He noted, though, that Watson referred to "the average homeowner." It’s fair, Barrett said by email, "to use the variable that we do." Our ruling Watson said the average Austin homeowner pays about $1,300 to $1,400 just for recapture, as in funds ultimately spent in other districts. By the Austin district’s analysis, the owners of a home at the district’s average taxable value for 2016-17 stands to pay $1,355 in school property taxes toward the district’s more than $400 million recapture payment for the year.

pomt-05534	President Barack Obama "has doubled the size of government since he took office."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/10/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-barack-obama-has-doubled-size-government/	On his congressional website, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., makes a striking claim that President Obama has doubled the size of goverment. Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, is perhaps the leading Republican voice for a fiscally conservative approach to taxing, spending and reducing the federal debt. So when a reader recently pointed out the doubling-government claim on a web page devoted to Ryan’s views on tax policy, we thought it was worth a look. Here’s an excerpt from the Web page: "At a time when Wisconsinites are facing economic uncertainty, a high unemployment rate and a rise in the costs of living, the last thing our country needs are tax increases. President Obama, however, has proposed $1.6 trillion in new taxes on families, small businesses and job creators and tripling the debt since he was elected. At the same time, the president has doubled the size of government since he took office. Instead of chasing higher spending with ever-higher taxes, Congress needs to make our tax code fair, competitive and simple. Unfortunately, our current tax system fails on these three elements." Further down the page, Ryan adds a bit more detail about his doubling-government claim. "Strong leadership is needed in the White House, but despite repeated acknowledgments of the gravity of the federal government’s fiscal outlook, the president seems to have ignored the warnings of his own experts and punted on the (fiscal year) 2012 budget. The budget proposal he submitted to Congress last year continues down the same unsustainable path: doubling the size of government since the President took office, imposing $1.6 trillion in new taxes on families, small businesses and job creators and tripling the debt since the President was elected. This crushing burden of debt is holding back economic growth. President Obama’s budget was defeated by a vote of 0 to 97 in the Senate. We have tried to borrow, spend,and tax our way to prosperity, and it hasn’t worked. The President is expected to put forward his budget proposal for (fiscal year) 2013 in the near future. I remain hopeful that he will work with Congress to address these important challenges facing our country." According to the second passage above, Ryan is referring to Obama’s fiscal year 2012 budget proposal -- the one released in early 2011, rather than the current one, which was released in early 2012. So we’ll focus on Obama’s fiscal year 2012 proposal. We didn’t hear back from Ryan’s office, but we think the most obvious way to interpret his statement is by measuring the size of federal outlays -- that is, the money spent by the federal government. Ryan is, after all, talking about budget figures. First, let’s look at the amount of federal outlays when Obama "took office." According to the Office of Management and Budget, federal outlays for fiscal year 2009 -- the fiscal year that was underway when Obama was inaugurated -- totaled $3.5 trillion. To look at federal outlays for subsequent years, we turned to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress. The numbers are broadly similar to OMB’s, but since CBO is an independent agency, rather than part of the Obama administration, budget experts suggested that we use CBO’s numbers instead. CBO concluded that by fiscal year 2012 -- the current fiscal year -- the president’s budget proposal would increase federal outlays to $3.7 trillion. That’s a 6 percent increase -- a far cry from doubling. If you take a longer time horizon, the outlays come closer to doubling, but still not close. By fiscal year 2021 -- the final year for which CBO provided its analysis and long after Obama will have left office -- federal outlays would reach $5.8 trillion. That’s an increase of 66 percent, which is still not double. However, even if that figure truly represented a doubling, using the 2021 figure is misleading. When Ryan said that Obama "has doubled the size of government since he took office," it sounds like he’s saying Obama has already doubled the size of government -- not that his spending blueprint will lead to doubled federal outlays at a point five years after Obama’s theoretical second term in office will have come to an end. "I think it is pretty clear" that Ryan’s claim "in a straight budget sense is false, because it implies it has already happened," said Steve Ellis, the vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. Just to be sure, we also looked at the figures for federal outlays as a percentage of gross domestic product. These numbers actually decline from 25.0 percent in fiscal 2009 to 23.6 percent in fiscal 2012, and then moves within a narrow range, ending up at 24.2 percent in fiscal 2021. No doubling here, either. Finally, there’s the question of whether Obama would be to blame even if the doubling claim was true. Roy T. Meyers, a political scientist at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County who specializes in budget issues, is skeptical "Were all the increased outlays because of Obama's actions? Of course not," Meyers said. "Many of them were the result of ‘mandatory’ policies in place before he took office, and those policies responded to unfavorable economic conditions -- deposit insurance, food stamps, Medicaid, unemployment insurance and so on." Indeed, discretionary spending -- the line items that Obama had the most control over when he assembled his budget -- represented between 25 and 40 percent of federal outlays during most of the 10 year period that CBO studied. The rest -- a clear majority -- consists of mandatory spending and net interest on the federal debt. Finally, while we doubted this is what Ryan meant, we also looked at whether the number of federal employees had doubled under Obama. Federal employment has never risen by more than 10 percent above its January 2009 level, excluding temporary Census jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And there is no reliable statistical way to measure changes in the federal government's regulatory burden, said Stan Collender, a former staff member of the House and Senate Budget Committees, who is a partner at Qorvis, a public relations firm. Our ruling Even Ryan’s out-of-date budget data offers no support for the notion that Obama "has doubled the size of government since he took office." As the House's budget leader and a key spokesman for his party’s budgetary proposals, Ryan should have known better. We rate his statement Pants on Fire. UPDATE: After our story appeared, Ryan’s office got back to us. They said that they had been using fiscal year 2008 as their base year, rather than fiscal year 2009. Using the 2008 figures, federal outlays do roughly double between 2008 and 2021 under Obama’s fiscal year 2012 budget proposal. However, we think it’s inaccurate to use fiscal 2008 as the base year, since that year ended about four months before Obama took office. In any case, our previous concerns -- using figures for 2021, when Obama will have been out of office for either five or nine years, and ignoring the role of mandatory spending in expanding federal outlays -- still stand, and we’re keeping the rating at Pants on Fire. In addition, Ryan’s office removed the sentence we checked after our story appeared. It has been replaced by a sentence that reads, "At the same time, the president will double the national debt and his plan ensures it will triple in the next eight years."

pomt-03458	If Gov. Rick Scott activates "the National Guard in anticipation of a federal disaster, the state’s costs, including the costs to recall any furloughed guardsmen, will be fully reimbursable by FEMA."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/jun/18/bill-nelson/bill-nelson-says-fema-will-fully-reimburse-florida/	Republican Gov. Rick Scott and Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson recently sparred about the impact of sequestration on the Florida National Guard. Tropical Storm Andrea’s arrival in early June prompted Scott to write Nelson and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, urging them to work with the Department of Defense to spare civilian guard employees from pay cuts as a result of the automatic spending cuts agreed to by President Barack Obama and Congress. About 1,000 employees of the Florida National Guard must take a furlough day each week starting July 8 to Sept. 30, the end of the federal budget year. The support employees repair planes and vehicles, provide medical services and handle duties such as public affairs and human relations. "These forced cuts to guardsmen not only immediately result in lost income for Florida guard families, they also force the state to spend state tax dollars to make up for days of emergency functions, which could have been avoided if not for the Department of Defense cuts," Scott said. Rubio told a Gannett reporter there wasn’t much he could do to avoid the sequester without raising taxes. Nelson responded with his own letter, saying it was too late to redo the cuts with just four months left in the fiscal year. Nelson said he consulted the legal team of the Federal Emergency Management Administration about Scott’s concerns. "Regarding your concern about increased costs to the state, let me share with you what I have received from the legal office of FEMA Director Craig Fugate. If you as governor activate the National Guard in anticipation of a federal disaster, the state’s costs, including the costs to recall any furloughed guardsmen, will be fully reimbursable by FEMA," Nelson wrote. Nelson then quoted from FEMA, which said that "under a Presidential disaster declaration, FEMA reimburses the State (Grantee), subject to the State cost-share, for costs in excess of those incurred for weekend drills and annual training and other non-disaster related activations." Scott wasn’t satisfied with Nelson’s response (saying nothing of Rubio’s). He enlisted his top emergency management official to write Nelson, saying his claim that the "state’s costs, including the costs to recall any furloughed guardsmen, will be fully reimbursable by FEMA," runs counter to recent history. We wanted to look at Nelson’s claim since the Scott administration deemed it factually problematic. Let’s say a potentially crazy storm is heading to Florida. What’s a governor to do? In order for FEMA to be involved, Scott must declare a state of emergency. If the situation is more than local and state resources can handle, the governor then requests the president issue an emergency declaration. FEMA reviews the request and makes a recommendation to the president. FEMA has limitations on what it can do for a state without a presidential declaration. "One of those is, it’s not going to pay the guard," said Ernest Abbott, who served as FEMA’s general counsel during President Bill Clinton’s second term. Now he runs a private practice specializing in FEMA law. Presidential emergency declarations are made ahead of a threat, such as prior to a hurricane’s landfall. Florida has had 12. They are meant to supplement local and state efforts for some activities, such as evacuations. Disaster declarations, of which Florida has had 65, are issued by the president after a catastrophic event, usually per the governor’s request. If the president makes a declaration, FEMA then decides which area is eligible for federal relief and which programs are appropriate. The federal share of assistance is always at least 75 percent, according to FEMA. That’s been the norm for Florida in recent years. Florida has not received 100 percent reimbursement for a major disaster declaration since 2005, when FEMA covered expenses for hurricanes Wilma, Dennis and Katrina, according to the state Division of Emergency Management. For the state’s nine disasters since 2007, the federal government paid between 75 and 80 percent, according to the Florida Division of Emergency Management. That includes severe storms and tornadoes in 2007, two days of damage for Tropical Storm Fay in 2008, Hurricanes Ike and Gustav in 2008, flooding in north Florida in 2009, and Tropical Storm Debby and Hurricane Isaac in 2012. Even though the feds paid for most of the costs, they did not pay for all of them. There is a possibility FEMA could pick up the entire tab for debris removal and emergency protective work for a three-day period, which happened eight times during the state's busy hurricane seasons in 2004 and 2005. FEMA’s legal team assured Nelson that recalling furloughed workers for an emergency would be subject to the federal and state cost-sharing, according to his letter to Scott. But the Scott administration said much is unknown because the sequester is such a new animal. "Will FEMA reimburse us for two additional days? We don’t know what’s going to happen," said Glenn Sutphin, legislative affairs director for the Florida Department of Military Affairs. FEMA told us what it told Nelson, that it reimburses a state at a cost-share for emergency work done on top of non-disaster activities like annual training and weekend drills (so long as a declaration is issued). The problem is: Nelson didn’t say it that precisely in his letter. He said the state’s National Guard expenses would be "fully reimbursable." Fully, to us and the dictionary,means completely. But that’s not a sure thing. Florida is not guaranteed a federal reimbursement of any amount if Scott activates the National Guard ahead of a storm. He needs a presidential declaration. Further, the reimbursement is rarely full; the federal government most often shares 75 percent of the costs. We rate Nelson’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-11048	Says proposal to use city-owned land for an Austin pro soccer stadium is a "$1 billion giveaway."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2018/jun/27/austin-better-future/claim-austin-soccer-plan-1-billion-givewaway-targe/	It’s an alarming contention: The Austin City Council is poised to "give" more than $1 billion to a private company and receive nothing in return as it seeks to lure a Major League Soccer team. The anti-stadium political action committee making the claim of a "$1 billion giveaway" — called Austin for a Better Future — drives home the enormity of the sum in an internet video by conjuring a wish list of alternative uses for the money. By Wednesday afternoon, the video had been viewed more than 20,000 times. "Imagine what else we could do with another billion dollars to make our city even better," intones the video’s youthful-looking narrator. He raises the prospect of using the money to instead fund annual pay raises for Austin school teachers, "full-ride scholarships" to the University of Texas for every local high school graduate, or newly built homes "for every single homeless person in the city of Austin." Setting aside that no formal proposals exist to spend $1 billion on any of those items, we were curious whether it’s accurate to say the City Council will be handing such an amount to a private company and getting nothing in return if it approves the agreement for the soccer stadium as it currently is formulated? A representative of the anti-stadium group contacted by PolitiFact Texas said the $1 billion figure is based on simple math and actually is conservative. But two professors who study publicly funded economic incentives said the group’s analysis is off base, with one calling the $1 billion amount that the group came up with "crazy" and the other saying it "doesn’t pass the sniff test." Under the stadium proposal — on which the City Council is slated to take some key initial votes Thursday — the city-owned McKalla Place tract near the Domain in North Austin would be leased to Precourt Sports Ventures for $1 a year. Precourt, a Major League Soccer team owner, would then privately finance and build what it has estimated would be a $200 million stadium at the site. The city would own the land and the stadium, so Precourt wouldn’t pay any property taxes on the facility. The initial lease would last for 20 years, with three options for Precourt to renew it under the same terms. The anti-stadium group, which initially answered questions from PolitiFact Texas through e-mail but didn’t respond to a follow-up request for a phone interview, said it arrived at the "$1 billion giveaway" figure by first calculating the estimated property taxes that would be owed by Precourt if it owned the land, instead of leasing it from the city, and also made $250 million worth of improvements on it, which the anti-stadium group pegged as the value of the soccer stadium. The group then took that figure, based on 2017 property tax rates, and multiplied it by 80 years — the maximum term of the proposed lease, assuming all options were exercised. It also assumed 2.5 percent annual growth in local property values, arriving at its $1 billion-plus total. But Clint Peinhardt, a University of Texas at Dallas political science professor, said such an analysis has many holes, not the least of which is that 80 years is simply too long a time period to forecast accurately. Who knows, for instance, if soccer will even be played in 80 years, or if it will become so huge in the United States that it tops football in terms of a loyal fan base. What’s more, the anti-stadium group’s analysis doesn’t factor in depreciation, which would have a major impact on the value of the facility and the tax calculation. Or the possibility that the lease would not be renewed by the soccer team’s ownership. Or the potential for something even more outlandish — such as a meteor destroying the site and rendering the entire exercise moot. "Anything that far out in the future — 80 years — is a pretty crazy thing to try to guess," Peinhardt said. "In general, that is just a huge time frame." As a result, Peinhardt and Nathan Jensen, a University of Texas at Austin professor of government, said it’s too much of a leap of logic to simply add up the value of property taxes that wouldn’t be due for decades and then contend city leaders are "giving them away" in the present if they approve the stadium plan. They said the "time value of money" — whereby a dollar today is worth much more than a theoretical dollar in the future — just doesn’t work that way. The pair also noted that the anti-stadium group’s analysis assumes no benefits to the city — in terms of jobs, tourism or nearby development — to offset the purported $1 billion cost to taxpayers. While taxpayer incentives for a soccer stadium might not be the most "revenue-maximizing" path for the city to choose for the McKalla site — particularly since other plans recently have been proposed for the tract — they said the potential positives should be considered along with the negatives. There is also the detail that, as currently proposed, the city would still own the stadium outright if the team’s ownership didn’t renew the deal. Jensen described himself as a critic of the current stadium plan, but he nonetheless dismissed the anti-stadium group’s number, saying it isn’t "a credible calculation" or a serious fiscal analysis. Our ruling A video by an anti-stadium group claims the Austin City Council is poised to give more than $1 billion to a private company and receive nothing in return. While the City Council could potentially provide incentives worth millions of dollars as part of the soccer stadium deal, the scary "$1 billion giveaway" language of the video simply doesn’t stand up to close scrutiny. The lengthy time frame invoked and the countless unknown events that could impact the deal make the math used in the video meaningless. Factor in that the video also doesn’t account for any return on the city’s investment, and it is clear that the contentions are off base — and ridiculous. We rate the claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-05605	Says U.S. Rep. Connie Mack "took seven and a half years to finish college."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/mar/28/george-lemieux/lemieux-says-congressman-mack-took-7-12-years-fini/	George LeMieux depicts Florida Republican U.S. Senate rival Connie Mack as a man who vaulted from college party boy to congressman. And those college days, well, they lasted awhile, according to LeMieux. In the Web ad "Two and a Half Macks" LeMieux says that "Connie the IV took seven and a half years to finish college," while showing a buffoonish-like Mack wearing a T-shirt that says "Kollege" and dancing around in front of a University of Florida sign. We’ve already checked other claims in the same February 2012 Web ad including that Mack "failed to pay his child support" (False) and whether his only job in the real world was an events coordinator for Hooters (Mostly False). In this item, we will explore how long it took Mack to finish college. Mack won a seat in the state House of Representatives, representing Broward and Palm Beach counties in 2000. He then moved to Southwest Florida and won a seat in Congress in 2004. LeMieux’s campaign directed us to a 2000 article in the Palm Beach Post, which detailed Mack’s route to his college degree: "Born Cornelius H. McGillicuddy, the younger Mack attended public high school in northern Virginia, transferring in the middle of his junior year to the Massanutten Military School in Woodstock, Va. "He left the military high school a year later in January 1986, lacking an English credit to graduate, and finished his high school requirement by enrolling that month at Sante Fe Community College in Gainesville. "He spent 2 1/2 years at the community college and transferred to the University of Florida in May 1988. He graduated from the university five years later, and three months shy of his 26th birthday, with a bachelor's degree in advertising." Subsequent news articles have repeated that it took Mack seven years, or seven and a half years, to finish college, including a 2012 Miami Herald article about Mack’s past. The Herald wrote about Mack’s time in college in connection to a legal case stemming from a 1992 bar brawl with professional baseball player Ron Gant. A jury found Gant started the fight but Mack didn’t win the legal damages or fees that he sought. The article stated that "Gant’s legal team sought to portray Mack as a troublemaking lightweight, noting he went to military school and that it took him more than seven years to get an advertising degree that, ultimately, he parlayed into a consultancy to promote Hooters, the Florida restaurant chain known for its scantily clad waitresses.’’ We contacted spokespersons for the two schools mentioned in the Palm Beach Post article. Known as Sante Fe Community College at the time (it’s now called Sante Fe College), Mack started in the spring term of 1986 and graduated in June 1988 with an associates of arts degree, said registrar Lynn Sullivan. That’s about two and a half years. Mack then transferred to the University of Florida in May 1988 and graduated in May 1993 with a bachelor’s of science degree in advertising, UF spokesman Stephen Orlando said. That’s about five years. So the math works. But there’s more to this story. We first asked about the overlap from May-June 1988, when Mack was technically a student at Sante Fe and UF. Orlando, the UF spokesman, said that it wasn’t unusual -- students can be admitted and register for classes with the presumption that they will earn the associate’s degree during that same semester -- in this case, the "summer A" semester of 1988. Then there’s the Post reference that Mack was finishing his high school requirements by enrolling in community college. Sullivan, the Sante Fe registrar, told us in an email that she couldn’t provide additional information. Mack campaign spokesman David James says the amount of time it took Mack to finish college depends on PolitiFact’s definition. For starters, Mack was dual-enrolled in high school and college in the spring of 1986 -- so the date he enrolled in community college overlaps technically with the time he would still be considered in high school. On top of that, James said, Mack took two years off from school -- 1991 and 1992 -- to work a full-time sales job. Mack finished school through correspondence classes, earning his diploma in 1993. That information -- at least the part about Mack being away from UF for 1991 and 1992 -- is corroborated through school records. Orlando said that Mack was at UF starting with the "summer A" session in May 1988. He continued at UF through the fall of 1990, records show. But Mack did not take classes in 1991 or 1992. He returned for the spring semester of 1993, taking a couple of courses that were not on campus. That means Mack was taking classes at or through UF for about three years, not five. Our ruling The claim here is that Mack "took seven and a half years to finish college." There’s a kernel of truth to that statement. Mack enrolled at Sante Fe Community College in 1986 and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor’s degree about seven and a half years later in 1993. But UF records show that Mack did not take classes for two of those years, 1991 and 1992. There’s also a minor point that Mack says he was dual-enrolled in community college at the same time he was completing his high school degree. Those, to us, are critical facts that would give someone seeing the ad a much different impression of Mack’s college career -- which fits our definition of Mostly False.

pomt-10214	John McCain "took on the drug industry."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/09/john-mccain/he-butted-heads-with-big-pharma/	Next to Big Oil, few businesses make more convenient political punching bags than drug companies. Anecdotes about cash-strapped seniors cutting their pills in half or crossing the border to Canada or Mexico to fill prescriptions have provided red meat for campaigns at the national and local levels. Now John McCain's campaign is joining in. An ad unveiled Sept. 8, 2008, portrays McCain and running mate Sarah Palin as mavericks willing to take on all comers. Over still photos of the pair, an announcer describes how each stood up to members of their own party and enumerates various reform efforts. A few — "He fights pork barrel spending" ( We found a few blips on the record), "She stopped the 'Bridge to Nowhere,' " (She didn't kill it, she performed last rites), "She Took on Big Oil" (Yes, she did), — we've ruled on previously. One claim was new: "He took on the drug industry." We wondered if McCain really did battle Big Pharma. Though he isn't often associated with health care issues, McCain sounded a bit like Hillary Rodham Clinton last year when he assailed drugmakers for profiteering. He even took a swat at the industry during a Jan. 5 Republican debate in New Hampshire, when Mitt Romney defended drugmakers against criticism by other GOP presidential aspirants, by saying, "Don't turn this pharmaceutical manufacturers into the big bad guys," and McCain interjected, "Well, they are." In the Senate, McCain has backed up that belief by pushing legislation to liberalize drug importation and expand the availability of lower-cost generic drugs, each of which would cut into name-brand pharmaceutical manufacturers' profits — and that prompted strenuous opposition from the companies. Each of the efforts also involved working across the aisle with Democrats. In 2001, for example, McCain and Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., collaborated on legislation that would have rewritten patent law to make it more difficult for brand-name drugmakers to stave off competition from generic versions once their original patents have expired. The measure came at a time of mounting public criticism over drug prices but triggered strong resistance from mostly Republican critics, who said the effort would discourage research spending by big drug manufacturers. McCain and Schumer's measure passed the Senate by a 78-21 margin in 2002 but was never taken up by the House. The Bush administration eventually confronted the ongoing buzz about drug pricing by proposing a Food and Drug Administration rule to shorten the time that brand-name drugmakers can market drugs without competition from cheaper generic competitors. In 2003, McCain again went against the wishes of drugmakers by opposing a sweeping Medicare package that created first-time outpatient prescription drug coverage for seniors. McCain objected to the costs associated with providing coverage to each of the program's more than 40-million beneficiaries, and had he and like-minded lawmakers prevailed, coverage likely would have been limited to lower-income populations. In 2004, McCain waded into another sensitive issue for the drug industry, when he joined with the likes of Sens. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Byron L. Dorgan, D-N.D., to push legislation that would allow prescription drugs to be imported from Canada, where price controls keep costs down. (The federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act bars drug importation except by the manufacturer and stipulates that the products can be dispensed only with a prescription). Like the generic drug bill, this measure also picked up substantial bipartisan support, along with the backing of seniors lobby AARP, but ran into resistance from the drug industry and Bush administration, which argued it could open the U.S. market to a flood of dangerous or counterfeit medicines. Senate Republican leaders — who controlled the chamber at the time and wanted to avoid sending President Bush a popular bill he might have to veto in the middle of an election campaign — didn't allow the measure to come up for a vote. Joe Antos, a health policy scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said McCain's legislative stands showed a clear willingness to confront the drug industry but added that they stem as much from the Arizona senator's broader concern about industries' potential to game government policies for profit as from any particular beef he has with drugmakers. Antos said a McCain administration probably would be less receptive to pharmaceutical industry entreaties for streamlined regulations or other favorable policies than the Bush administration has. "His natural skepticism would come right to the front," Antos said. Democrats contend that even while McCain was promoting politically appealing proposals to deal with drug costs, he was quietly doing the industry favors with respect to advertising regulations and how much it can charge government programs for its products. Barack Obama's campaign, in a rebuttal to the Sept. 8 ad, notes that during the 2003 debate on the Medicare drug benefit, McCain voted with the majority of the Senate against an amendment that would have required drugmakers to release advertising with balanced information or be subject to civil penalties. During the 2002 generic drug debate, McCain voted against an amendment that was adopted by the Senate that allowed states to use their volume purchasing power to buy lower-priced drugs for uninsured people who don't qualify for Medicaid. And in 1995, he voted against offering drug discounts to state Medicaid programs and public health facilities during a debate on balanced-budget legislation. These votes might indeed have helped the drug industry at crucial times. But they were on narrow amendments to broader bills and are not as significant as McCain's stands on importation and generics, which prompted stiff resistance from big, name-brand drug companies and their allies in Congress. McCain can rightly claim that he confronted drug companies on sensitive issues that affected its bottom line. For this reason, we rule his statement Mostly True.

pomt-08661	John Boehner has called for "repealing the rest of the stimulus, which would raise taxes on 110 million middle class people."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/13/austan-goolsbee/austan-goolsbee-says-boehner-wants-repeal-stimulus/	On ABC's This Week on Sept. 12, 2010, Austan Goolsbee, the new chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, picked up on President Barack Obama's recent attacks on House Republican Leader John Boehner. "I would point out that Representative Boehner has a different view and is calling for repealing the rest of the stimulus, which would raise taxes on 110 million middle class people," Goolsbee said. That Boehner has called for a halt to stimulus spending is undisputed. The question is whether that means Boehner would put the kibosh on the Making Work Pay tax credits included in the economic stimulus package that passed in early 2009. The tax credits came to $400 for working individuals, $800 per couple, per year in 2009 and 2010. It was estimated to benefit about 110 million Americans. We asked Boehner's spokesman Michael Steel about Goolsbee's statement. "That is not correct," Steel wrote in an e-mail. "The savings we outline from cancelling unspent stimulus funds does not include Making Work Pay." We can see where the confusion arose. In his public statements about stopping stimulus spending, Boehner hasn't been particularly clear on the point. For example, in February 2010, Boehner released a statement calling on the Obama administration to start cutting spending immediately, and "that can begin by repealing spending from the stimulus." He doesn't make clear if he is leaving out the tax credits. More recently, when David Gregory questioned Boehner in an NBC Meet the Press interview on Aug. 8, 2010, about how Republicans would offset the cost of extending all of the Bush tax cuts, as they have proposed, Boehner responded, "Why don't we stop the stimulus spending? ... Why don't we stop it. It's not working." Making Work Tay tax credits are stimulus spending. And while they are set to expire in just a few months (the end of 2010), in theory, the government could cut them off tomorrow. But we think Steel has credible evidence to support the claim that Boehner's call to repeal stimulus spending did not extend to Making Work Pay. His previous comments have focused entirely on the stimulus spending programs, not the tax cuts. For example, in the Meet the Press interview, Boehner voiced support for spending cuts outlined by Republican Reps. Paul Ryan and Jeb Hensarling -- which suggested there was $266 billion in unspent stimulus that could be redirected to pay down the deficit. In a previous item, we looked into the claim that there was really that much "unspent" stimulus, and concluded there was actually much less, even if you included money from Making Work Pay that the government hasn't yet paid out. More importantly, though, the plan from the Republican caucus of the Commitee on the Budget to "Cancel remaining 'stimulus' funds" specifically references H.R. 3140, introduced by Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga. Price's bill targets "unspent stimulus," and the legislative language makes clear that the stimulus package's tax sections -- including the Making Work Pay tax credit -- would not be impacted. According to a section by section summary of the bill from the Republican Study Committee, Price's bill "rescinds or repeals all of the spending in the 'stimulus' excepting only the tax provisions and the unemployment benefits." Press releases issued from legislative co-sponsors of the bill also note that the tax provisions of the stimulus would not be impacted. There are some political games being played by both sides here, of course. Republicans like Boehner want to attack the stimulus without acknowledging that it included tax relief (an idea Republicans traditionally support). And Democrats want to remind that it does. But in this case, we think Goolsbee is overreaching to make his point. Yes, Boehner and other Republicans have talked about putting a halt to all unspent stimulus -- and without being more specific, one might wonder if that includes money not yet spent on tax credits. But when you dig into the nitty-gritty of the Republicans' plan, it specifically notes that it does not include repeal of Making Work Pay. And so we rule Goolsbee's claim False.

pomt-07411	"We have created more jobs in this last year than the Bush administration (did) in eight years."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/apr/28/joe-biden/vice-president-joe-biden-says-there-were-more-new-/	Vice President Joe Biden loves campaigning in Ohio. He did so 15 times during the 2010 Midterm elections for various state and federal candidates. But Democrats still suffered a "shellacking," he joked during an April 19 campaign fundraiser in Cleveland for U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, who faces re-election next year. Citing positive economic news, Biden insisted, however, that the political debate about his administration’s policies now favors Democrats. "A lot of things we took a shellacking for, the American public has had an opportunity to take a good look at now," he said. Biden noted the improving unemployment rate. And he added this comparison: "We have created more jobs in this last year than the Bush administration (did) in eight years. We are in a position where we are moving to toward creating an average of 220,000 jobs a month. Not enough, but we are moving." PolitiFact Ohio likes comparisons and decided to examine this one because it’s emerging as a key Democratic talking point. When checking out job figures, PolitiFact turns to The Bureau of Labor Statistics, the official score keeper of U.S. employment numbers. The BLS numbers are based on monthly surveys of employers. It updates the monthly figure as employers complete their surveys and it incorporates into the monthly figure a more complete quarterly census of employment and wages. First, we can quickly dispense with the Biden’s lead-in: That the unemployment rate is improving. In March, the national unemployment rate dropped for the fourth consecutive month. At 8.8 percent, the rate is down from a recession peak of 10.1 in Oct. 2009, according to the BLS. Also, we can dispense with the last part: "We are moving to toward creating an average of 220,000 jobs a month. Not enough, but we are moving." Since it’s not really a statement of fact and includes a prediction, we’ll leave that to be examined down the road. But how about the Obama vs. Bush job comparison? The number of jobs as of February 2001, the first full month of Bush’s presidency, was 132.53 million. The number of jobs as of January 2009, the month he left office, was 133.56 million. That’s a net gain 1.03 million jobs. To checkout Biden’s claim, we looked back 12 months, from March 2010 to March of 2011. (Though Biden made remarks this month, April figures have not yet been tallied.) The number of jobs in March 2010 was 129.43 million. The number of jobs in March 2011 is 130.73 million. The net gain during the last year is 1.3 million jobs. That means 270,000 more jobs were created in the last 12 months than the net total of jobs at the end of Bush’s two terms. A familiar detour, or caveat, is in order. Typically, the most recent BLS monthly job figures are preliminary and will change as surveys are completed and figures are updated. That means the 270,000 edge for the Obama administration could increase -- or disappear. Politifact also frequently points that when framing job figures, slicing and timing make all the difference. Republicans, for instance, like to frame the jobs story this way: The U.S. has lost a total of 2.09 million jobs since Obama’s first full-month in office in February 2009. That’s true. Of course, looking at this way shortchanges the impact of the deep recession Obama inherited and the recent economic growth. Likewise, Democrats shortchange Bush when they ignore that the U.S. created more than 5.6 million jobs through January 2008, when the recession began to take hold. The bottom line is that the recession, which officially began in Dec. 2007, hurt the job record of both presidents. So where does that leave Biden’s statement? He’s correct about the declining unemployment rate. He’s also accurate about the gains made in the last year. The figure also falls within the context that the recovery has been slow and painful but the job picture is improving of late, albeit slowly. Understanding how he slices job numbers in his comparison is a point that provides clarification. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Biden’s statement as Mostly True.

pomt-10504	"(Obama) did accept donations from lobbyists and PACs and he spent money in this campaign from that, through his political action committee."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/27/bill-clinton/a-small-amount-before-he-announced/	In a March 16, 2008, interview with a group of college journalists, the mtvU editorial board, former President Bill Clinton was asked why Sen. Hillary Clinton had not made a pledge not to accept campaign contributions from lobbyists, as Sen. Barack Obama has. "He (Obama) did accept donations from lobbyists and PACs and he spent money in this campaign from that, through his political action committee," Bill Clinton said. "He said one thing and did another." Clinton is talking here about Obama's leadership PAC, Hopefund. Leadership PACs are political action committees established by members of Congress to support other candidates. All the other presidential candidates shut down their leadership PACs when they announced their candidacy, but Obama's PAC continued to distribute more than $400,000 to political candidates and parties after Obama entered the ring on Feb. 10, 2007. "And this money did come from lobbyists and special interest groups," Clinton said. Clinton is right, but some scale is in order. According to an analysis for PolitiFact by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, of the $4.5-million raised by Obama's Hopefund, $16,500 came from lobbyists, and $125,000 from political action committees such as Lockheed Martin Employees' PAC, AT&T; Corp. PAC and Walt Disney Productions Employees. The biggest donors were lawyers and law firms, accounting for nearly a half-million dollars. So Obama's leadership PAC did raise money from lobbyists and PACs, though it amounted to just a fraction of the total fundraising. Also notable is that the money was collected before Obama announced his presidential candidacy, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. PolitiFact has already weighed in on Obama's campaign pledge not to take money from lobbyists or PACs, finding that while he has eschewed money from federally registered lobbyists, he has accepted thousands from people who work for lobbying firms. We have also noted that Hillary Clinton has raised more campaign donations from registered lobbyists than any other candidate. Common sense suggests the distributions to candidates were meant to advance Obama's campaign, particularly when almost 43 percent of the money was spent on candidates in states with early primaries. (See our related ruling on this point here). One question is whether Obama's Hopefund distributions violate Obama's pledge not to accept lobbyist or PAC money in his run for president. Because the contributions were made prior to the start of his campaign, we find they do not. Therefore it's a stretch for Clinton to say, "He said one thing and did another." But we're checking Clinton's claim that "(Obama) did accept donations from lobbyists and PACs and he spent money in this campaign from that, through his political action committee." And Obama's leadership PAC did accept $16,000 from lobbyists, and another $125,000 from PACs, even though it was collected before Obama was an announced candidate. And nearly half of Hopefund's money was spent on key primary states during the campaign. So we rate Clinton's claim True.

pomt-14316	"We have not taken away any rights that have currently existed in any city in North Carolina" with the passage of HB2.	false	/north-carolina/statements/2016/mar/30/pat-mccrory/pat-mccrory-wrong-when-he-says-north-carolinas-new/	Ever since North Carolina passed a new state law banning cities and counties from enacting their own ordinances on discrimination laws, minimum wages and more, Republican leaders have been on the defensive in the face of national attention. A major talking point has been that, even despite the new law, nothing has actually changed. Gov. Pat McCrory has said as much in person as well as in written statements. Other GOP leaders who supported the bill have done the same. "We have not taken away any rights that have currently existed in any city in North Carolina, from Raleigh to Durham to Chapel Hill to Charlotte," McCrory said at a press conference Monday. "Every city and every corporation has the exact same discrimination policy this week as they had two weeks ago." We’re going to focus specifically on the claim about cities. When asked about it at that press conference Monday, McCrory said he was blindsided by the question and couldn’t answer it. The reporter had asked, specifically, about the status of a housing discrimination ordinance in Greensboro and a policy in Raleigh that said any contractors who wanted to do business with the local government needed to have policies forbidding discrimination against gay or transgender people. Carrboro also has a similar policy for contractors. A spokesman for the governor later said local housing ordinances wouldn’t be affected, citing a part of the bill that exempts "any private club or other establishment not, in fact, open to the public." But he had no answers about Carrboro and Raleigh on Monday. He didn’t respond to a follow-up email sent Wednesday. Another spokesman responded only to say he wasn’t the right person to ask. Perhaps that’s because the law does invalidate those ordinances. "He’s completely wrong about that, unfortunately," said Carrboro’s town attorney, Nick Herman, about McCrory’s claim that the law doesn’t take away any existing rights. Herman said the governor’s comments surprised him. Carrboro, for years, has had a policy that contractors paid by the town must have anti-discrimination policies that include sexual orientation or gender identity. And HB2 specifically says that local governments do not have the right to put any such requirements on contractors. "I was absolutely shocked to hear that the governor – I give him all presumption of good faith – but for him to claim this bill does not change existing law means he is not being adequately advised," Herman said. More towns and counties around the state also had in-house anti-discrimination policies that protected local government employees on the basis of sexual orientation and/or gender identity. McCrory has also said those won’t go away, although some of the officials in those municipalities say they’re skeptical. We interviewed three law professors about it; two disagreed with McCrory and one agreed with him. No more state claims for discrimination Taking a broader look at the law, it also took away a right that had previously been available to residents of any and every city in the state – the ability to file a state lawsuit over discriminatory firing. Such claims had been accepted by state courts since the 1980s, but they are no longer valid under HB2. "This Article does not create, and shall not be construed to create or support, a statutory or common law private right of action, and no person may bring any civil action based upon the public policy expressed herein," the law states. "This is a seismic issue," said Eric Doggett, a Raleigh lawyer who works in employment discrimination. "It’s huge. It’s a massive loss of rights, and it happened with almost no debate." Laura Noble, a Chapel Hill employment discrimination lawyer, agreed. "I won’t refer to this as a ‘bathroom bill’ because that's really not what it's about," she said. "It’s about the elimination of discrimination protections." The law does say people who believe they were fired for discriminatory reasons can still bring suits to the state executive branch’s Human Resource Commission. But Doggett said that group doesn’t have the ability to award damages, like the state courts did until last Wednesday. "There’s no remedy," he said. "They have no teeth. … If we state it's the public policy of this state not to discriminate on those bases, it doesn’t mean anything if we can't enforce it." Noble concurred, saying that no matter the state discrimination policy is now, it’s largely meaningless. "What's the point of having it on the books if there's no sanctions if someone violates it?" She said. People can still file federal discrimination lawsuits. However, both attorneys said federal courts have a much shorter statute of limitations than state courts – less than six months, compared to three years – which often stops plaintiffs from suing if they have a case but waited too long. Debbie Durban, a corporate attorney with Nelson Mullins who practices in North and South Carolina, has experience defending businesses from discrimination claims. She also said her understanding of the bill is that it takes away state lawsuits, although she said most state claims eventually end up at the federal level anyway. Our ruling McCrory said that with the passage of HB2, "we have not taken away any rights that have currently existed in any city in North Carolina." That is not true. It took away the rights of cities to put certain anti-discrimination requirements on private contractors, and it nullified existing policies like in Carrboro and Raleigh. It might have also taken away the rights of cities and counties to pass their own in-house anti-discrimination policies, depending on which lawyer you ask. And it takes away the right of everyone in North Carolina to file a state-level lawsuit alleging a discriminatory firing, according to attorneys who represent both employers and employees in those cases. But even if you discount the discrimination lawsuit changes and only focus on municipal government powers and rights, McCrory is still wrong. We rate this claim False.

pomt-13798	"(Koch Industries) is among the worst in toxic air pollution in the entire United States ... and churns out more climate-changing greenhouse gases than oil giants Chevron, Shell and Valero."	mostly true	/nevada/statements/2016/jul/19/harry-reid/reid-right-claiming-kochs-produce-more-pollution-o/	Charles and David Koch might be two of the people happiest about Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid’s impending retirement. The Nevada Democrat’s undisguised disdain for the billionaire brothers’ bankrolling of conservative groups is well-documented, and Reid’s long crusade against the Kochs isn’t letting up as he nears retirement. Kicking off a coordinated effort to draw attention towards conservative-leaning nonprofits and climate change skeptics, Reid zeroed in on the Kochs and accused them of being worse polluters than major oil companies. "The company is among the worst in toxic air pollution in the entire United States," he said during a July 11 floor speech. "Koch Industries churns out more climate-changing greenhouse gases than oil giants Chevron, Shell and Valero." This isn’t the first time Reid has tried to connect the Kochs’ business operations with climate change, but we were curious to see which company has the worst environmental record. Measuring pollution Reached by email, a Reid spokesperson cited a 2014 Rolling Stone article detailing the history behind the Koch family’s "Toxic Empire," particularly a line stating "Koch's climate pollution ... outpaces oil giants including Valero, Chevron and Shell." Rolling Stone cites a corporate polluter study published by the University of Massachusetts, Amherst’s Political Economy Research Institute. The "Greenhouse 100 Polluters Index" ranks Koch Industries 22nd on its list of polluters, creating more than 28 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions in 2014. The survey puts them ahead of the oil companies mentioned by Reid — Chevron (32nd), Royal Dutch Shell (27th) and Valero (26th) all produced fewer emissions in 2014 than Koch Industries, according to the report. Pretty clear, right? Koch Industries spokesman Ken Spain says Reid makes an unfair comparison between Koch and companies in essentially different industries with fewer facilities. "It is misleading to compare Koch Industries — one of the largest and diversified manufacturers in the US — to much smaller companies," he said in a statement. "Koch operates more than 200 manufacturing sites that employ 60,000 people in the U.S. Therefore, it is only logical that our GHG emissions are greater than a company that has far fewer facilities." Koch lands somewhere in the middle compared to the oil giants mentioned by Reid in terms of total revenue and employees, though they do own more facilities than the other three. Spain does have a point that Koch is more involved in manufacturing and refining goods that actually extracting and selling fossil fuels. The corporation is ranked 13th on the "Toxic 100 Air Polluters" list due to the roughly 31 million pounds of toxic air releases reported by the facilities owned by the Kochs. But Koch Industries does have many more facilities than Shell, Chevron and Valero. Koch Industries’ sites actually emits millions more toxic air releases than the 12 companies ahead of them on the list, such as top polluters Dow Chemical and ExxonMobil. But the company ranks lower than those because the survey adjusts the rankings to include levels of toxicity in the pollution, not just the total amount. Still, out-ranking just 12 companies isn’t exactly an environmental badge of honor. The corporation has a long history of violating environmental rules. In 2000, the company was fined a record $30 million due to repeated violations of environmental law, including more than 300 oil spills in six states. Koch Petroleum and other major polluters also reached an accord with the EPA that same year over air pollution, agreeing to spend $80 million to reduce refinery emissions and pay a $4.5 million penalty in return for a "clean slate" from the EPA. Invista, a Koch-owned subsidy, agreed in 2009 to a $1.7 million penalty and promised to spend up to $500 million to fix more than 680 self-reported violations of EPA standards at 12 facilities owned by the subsidy. PolitiFact also rated Charles Koch’s comments about the corporation being a "model for other companies" in terms of environmental regulation Mostly False, largely due to the numerous environmental crimes committed by the company throughout the late ‘90s and early 2000s. But Koch appears to be turning the corner. Rolling Stone acknowledges that the company has improved its regulatory compliance over time, which in the words of Charles Koch required a "monumental undertaking to integrate compliance into every aspect of the company." In a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, Koch environmental director Sheryl Corrigan said the company had reduced air emissions at its refineries by 76 percent since 1997. They’ve also downsized their oil pipeline business from a high of 37,000 miles of pipeline in the late 1990s to around 4,000. Spain also pointed out a 2014 EPA Toxics Release Inventory analysis, which tracks U.S. facilities that manage and release toxic chemicals. Koch-owned businesses managed 667 million pounds of production-related waste in 2014, but the company reported implementing 240 "Source Reduction Activities" over the same time period — more than Shell and Chevron (though the corporation listed many more facilities than the oil giants). Our ruling Reid said, "Koch Industries churns out more climate-changing greenhouse gases than oil giants Chevron, Shell and Valero." Reid’s claim accurately calls on facts established in a well-respected study of corporate pollution. Koch Industries does produce more greenhouse gas emissions than the oil companies listed by Reid. But it's a somewhat misleading, apples-to-oranges comparison, because there are more Koch facilities that cover more industries compared to the oil companies. The statement is accurate but needs additional information. That meets our definition of Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a24a3586-08cf-4ee9-a52a-85c7c46929c8	None	Harry Reid	None	None	None	2016-07-19T17:50:02	2016-07-11	['United_States', 'Koch_Industries', 'Chevron_Corporation', 'Valero_Energy_Corporation', 'Royal_Dutch_Shell']
pomt-06981	Says new GOP Wisconsin Assembly members "voted to take funding away from their public schools in their districts to give it to private Milwaukee voucher schools."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jul/13/peter-barca/wisconsin-state-rep-peter-barca-says-assembly-vote/	Although notable for cutting billions of dollars in spending and deficits, the new Wisconsin state budget also expands the nation’s largest and longest-running school choice program, which uses tax money to send nearly 21,000 lower-income Milwaukee children to private schools. The 2011-2013 budget, crafted by Republican Gov. Scott Walker and the GOP-controlled Legislature, cuts aid to public schools by nearly $800 million. But it includes nearly $12 million to pay for 3,000 more Milwaukee students the administration estimates will join the choice program over the two-year period. The expansion is one reason a Wall Street Journal editorial proclaimed 2011 "the year of school choice" in the United States. Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca, D-Kenosha, contends the expansion of choice, also known as the school voucher program, comes at the expense of public school districts throughout Wisconsin. Commenting in an article published June 26, 2011, the day Walker signed the budget into law, Barca focused his criticism on Republican members of the Assembly who were elected in November 2010. GOP freshmen who backed the budget, he claimed, "voted to take funding away from their public schools in their districts to give it to private Milwaukee choice schools." Barca, a former congressman who has served 10 years as a state lawmaker during two stints in the Assembly, made a similar claim the next day in a blog, and previously in a news release and in a letter to Walker. So, does spending more on the choice program take away money from public school districts throughout Wisconsin? First, some background. Size: The choice program, launched in the 1990-1991 school year, was created to allow low-income students in Milwaukee to attend private schools in Milwaukee at taxpayer expense. In 2010-2011, the nearly 21,000 choice students attended more than 100 private schools-- 84 percent of them religious -- according to the Public Policy Forum, a nonpartisan research organization in Milwaukee. The new state budget expands choice in three ways: Income limits were raised, making more families eligible; a cap on the number of choice students (22,500) was eliminated; and choice students can now attend private schools outside the City of Milwaukee. (Although Barca’s claim doesn’t address it, the budget also extends the choice program to students in Racine.) Cost: Private Milwaukee schools receive $6,442 in state aid for each choice student. That compares with $10,292 received in 2010-2011 by Milwaukee Public Schools, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. As we’ll see, the difference between the two per-pupil aid figures is key in the debate about the choice program’s effect on taxpayers. Financing: The $6,442 per student in tax money spent on choice in 2010-2011 came to nearly $131 million. The state pays roughly 62 percent and recoups the other 38 percent by reducing aid to Milwaukee Public Schools, according to the fiscal bureau. So, it’s clear the choice program takes money away from MPS; but whether choice is a net cost or a net gain for other public school districts is more complicated. When asked for evidence about the claim the expansion takes money away from districts outside of Milwaukee, Barca aides made three major points: The nearly $800 million in aid cuts affect only public schools. Barca spokeswoman Melanie Conklin said the state budget changes choice funding such that choice schools "are held harmless" and the aid reduction "is all taken from public districts across the state." But it doesn’t necessarily follow that the choice expansion was funded by cutting aid to public schools. Indeed, when choice was created, the state appropriated additional money for the program -- it didn’t take money from other public school districts, said Anneliese Dickman, research director of the Public Policy Forum. And when the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction detailed the nearly $800 million in what it called "catastrophic" cuts to public schools in the budget, it noted that only Milwaukee Public Schools -- no other public school districts -- lost money as a result of choice funding. GOP lawmakers rejected a move to block choice expansion. Conklin said all Republican lawmakers voted against a Democratic "save our schools" amendment to Walker’s budget that would have blocked the choice expansion. That point underscores how the new GOP lawmakers supported the expansion of choice. But it doesn’t get at the key question of whether the budget moves money from public school districts outside of Milwaukee to private schools in Milwaukee. The choice expansion means less money for all public schools. On this point, there is more debate. Conklin cited a Legislative Fiscal Bureau report that estimates the expansion will cost the state nearly $12 million. The total cost to pay for the 3,000 new students is actually $19 million, but the state would recoup 38 percent of that amount by providing about $7 million less in aid to Milwaukee Public Schools. The remaining 62 percent is the $12 million. Conklin argues that’s a $12 million cost to public school districts outside of Milwaukee. But the evidence doesn’t support her: Both Dickman of the Public Policy Forum and John Johnson, a spokesman for the state Department of Public Instruction, agreed that even if lawmakers decided against the choice expansion, it doesn’t mean the $12 million to fund it would have gone to public school districts. Lawmakers could have reallocated it for an entirely different purpose or opted not to appropriate it at all. The Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the state’s neutral authority on budget matters, declared in a November 2010 memo that other than Milwaukee Public Schools -- which loses state aid for each MPS student who transfers to a choice school -- "all school districts' aid payments and property tax levies are not affected by the choice program." Indeed, there is evidence the choice program saves money for other taxpayers around the state -- an assertion state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Evers calls debatable and another education researcher has criticized. The savings is based on the fact that choice schools get roughly $4,000 less per pupil in school aids than MPS does: A Legislative Fiscal Bureau fiscal bureau memo in May 2011 said that if choice were eliminated and 90 percent of current choice students went to Milwaukee Public Schools, non-MPS districts -- the out-state ones Barca referred to -- would have lost state money in the 2010-2011 school year. The loss would have been $82 million if the choice funds had been transferred to public schools and $155 million if the choice funds had simply been eliminated. The fiscal bureau in June 2011 cited work by professor Robert Costrell, a faculty member of the University of Arkansas’ School Choice Demonstration Project, which estimated the savings a different way. He found that in 2010-2011, using the 90 percent assumption, choice not only saved $31.5 million in state tax funds but also $57 million in property taxes for taxpayers outside of MPS. Costrell did new calculations for PolitiFact Wisconsin based on the 3,000 new students expected to enter the choice program in the next two years. If 90 percent of the new choice students instead attended MPS -- a figure Costrell said is used in other choice studies -- the higher MPS per-pupil cost would cost property taxpayers outside of MPS nearly $9 million more over two years and taxpayers statewide nearly $7 million in state taxes. But that’s based on the 90 percent assumption. What if many of the students who will be in the program didn’t come from MPS at all and instead are already in the private schools, but don’t currently qualify for choice based on income or other factors? They could stay at their school and now have tuition paid. Choice has been expanded twice before -- in 1998, when choice students were allowed to attend religious schools, and again in 2006, when the maximum number of students allowed in the program was raised. In the first year after both expansions, the Public Policy Forum found, roughly 40 percent of new choice students came from MPS schools and roughly 60 percent from private schools. Dickman said she expects a similar trend under the new choice expansion, as does Evers, the state superintendent. (One note: Walker’s budget proposal would have prohibited students who attended Milwaukee private schools in 2010-2011 from becoming choice students in 2011-2012. But that provision was removed by the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee, said Mike Ford, research associate for School Choice Wisconsin, which advocates for the choice program.) Costrell did another estimate, based on if only 40 percent of the 3,000 new students come from MPS. That would require $3.5 million more in state aid, but property taxpayers outside of MPS -- the taxpayers Barca referred to in his statement -- would still save nearly $3.9 million over two years, according to Costrell. The bottom line here is we won’t know until some time in the future how many new choice students will come from MPS or already be in a private school. But if this choice expansion plays out like the previous two, taxpayers outside of MPS would still save money as a result of the choice program, based on Costrell’s estimates. So, where does that leave us? Barca said that by supporting the 2011-2013 state budget, freshmen Republican Assembly members "voted to take funding away from their public schools in their districts to give it to private Milwaukee voucher schools." On a broad level, that is not true: the budget appropriates money separately for choice. To cover part of the cost, it reduces state aid to Milwaukee Public Schools, but not to other school districts. It is possible that if large numbers of the new choice students come from private schools rather than Milwaukee Public Schools, there could be a net loss to taxpayers outside of MPS. But research indicates that if past experience holds and 60 percent of the new choice students come from private schools, property taxpayers outside of MPS would still save money. To be sure, the full effect of the school choice expansion won’t be known for some time. But Barca didn’t state that depending on how the expansion plays out, it might cost other school districts -- he claimed that the expansion actually takes away money from those districts. There is no evidence of that. We rate Barca’s claim False.	None	Peter Barca	None	None	None	2011-07-13T09:00:00	2011-06-25	['Milwaukee']
pomt-02100	"When you read the Koran, it talks about don't take Christians and Jews as your friends."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/may/16/sean-hannity/sean-hannity-koran-says-dont-take-christians-and-j/	International concern seems to mount by the day for nearly 300 Nigerian schoolgirls held captive by Boko Haram, a militant Islamist group whose name means "Western education is forbidden." After threatening to sell the girls into slavery, a video released this week purports to show about 100 of them in full-length, black veils. The group leader says the girls converted from Christianity to Islam and will not be released unless imprisoned Boko Haram members are freed. Fox News host Sean Hannity isn’t the only pundit to denounce the group’s actions. He convened a panel on his May 12 show, which included liberal The Five co-host Bob Beckel, to criticize liberals touting the #BringBackOurGirls Twitter campaign supported by first lady Michelle Obama. We’ve seen conservatives offer similar criticisms in recent days, from Rush Limbaugh to Ann Coulter. Hannity took the discussion a step further, wondering if most Muslims subscribe to beliefs shared by Boko Haram. Beckel entered the conversation by saying the response from "supposedly moderate" heads of Muslim states has been weak. "I tried to call the Egyptian embassy and I called the Saudi embassy to ask for a comment about these 275 girls and got nothing from them! When is a cleric, when is an imam, finally going to stand up and say, ‘this is wrong’?" That’s when Hannity took over. "Do you think that this is general acceptance? When you read the Koran it talks about don’t take Christians and Jews as your friends. It talks about jihad. It talks about apostate. All these things are in there. And do you think most Muslims buy into this radicalism, or (are) there moderate Muslims that are intimidated?" Our question: Does the Koran talk about "don’t take Christians and Jews as your friends"? What is he talking about? A Fox News spokesperson said Hannity was talking about verse 5:51 of the Koran, the sacred book of Muslims. It’s a verse that has spawned blog posts and message board queries about what it really means. The original Koran (also Quran) is in Arabic, and Muslims believe it to be the word of Allah spoken to the prophet Mohammad via the angel Gabriel over a 23-year period. Just as there are multiple English translations for the Bible, there are also English translations of the Koran, and experts are split on which translations are best and true to the Arabic text -- and on whether it should be translated at all. Interpretations are subjective, as not every word in Arabic has a flawless English equivalent. "Scripture is not some sort of religious instruction manual that believers ingest uniformly and uncritically," says Kenneth Garden, a University of Tufts assistant professor of religion. "It inspires, yes, but it is also malleable and open to creative readings that highlight some passages and ignore others in ways we could never predict." Still, the Quranic Arabic Corpus, a website that allows users to select passages from the Koran and compare parallel translations, offers several English translations of verse 5:51. Here are a few we found: Saheeh International: "O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are (in fact) allies of one another. And whoever is an ally to them among you -- then indeed, he is (one) of them. Indeed, Allah guides not the wrongdoing people." Arberry: "O believers, take not Jews and Christians as friends; they are friends of each other. Whoso of you makes them his friends is one of them. God guides not the people of the evildoers." The Noble Qur'an: "O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Auliya' (friends, protectors, helpers, etc.), they are but Auliya' to one another. And if any amongst you takes them as Auliya', then surely he is one of them. Verily, Allah guides not those people who are the Zalimun (polytheists and wrong­doers and unjust)." The Message of The Quran says: "O you who have attained to faith! Do not take the Jews and Christians for your allies: they are but allies of one another -- and whoever of you allies himself with them becomes, verily, one of them; behold, God does not guide such evildoers." Most but not all of these translations refer to friends while another says allies. Is the meaning as simple as it seems? Lost in translation? What did the experts say? Reactions ranged from Hannity is partially right to wildly wrong. "Certainly 5:51 and other verses like it are great material for a group like Boko Haram to use," Garden said, while noting other verses contain messages of tolerance and warnings. "But apart from God speaking in a booming voice from on high and telling us how he would like the Koran to be interpreted, there is no objective way to say which is the correct reading of the scripture." Let’s start with the translation that introduces the word "Auliya’." Other versions use "friends," but that word connotes a sense of, well, friendliness that, according to some experts and opinions, isn’t supposed to be reflected in the text. "Auliya’" does not mean friends in the way of pals or companions. It’s meaning is more about allies, protectors or guardians. One footnote to this passage in The Message version of the Koran says "this prohibition of a ‘moral alliance’ with non-Muslims does not constitute an injunction against normal, friendly relations with such of them as are well-disposed towards Muslims." Broader historical context is key, experts told us. The verse refers to a specific period of tribal society in Mohammed’s time, one marked by interreligious strife in which some Muslims in Medina were considering siding with certain Jewish tribes, said John L. Esposito, author of What Everyone Needs to Know About Islam and founding director of Georgetown University’s Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding. "What Hannity is doing is just cherry-picking a passage," Esposito said. "It would be the equivalent of taking any of the statements in the Old Testament where God tells his people to fight and kill." "The order here is not to take them as guardians or protectors," said Khaleel Mohammed, a San Diego State University professor who has compared English translations of the Koran. "Incidentally, the word for ‘guardian’ in Arabic and in Islamic terminology is ‘wali,’ the singular of Awliya." Reading the passage as Muslims cannot be friends with Christians and Jews flies in the face of the general treatment of those religions in the Koran, Esposito said. The different faiths share a connection to Abraham and a belief in the monotheistic God, and Islam acknowledges the word of God also coming in the Torah, Psalms and Gospels of the Bible. "It contradicts the principle that both Christians and Jews are considered ‘ahl al-kitab,’ the people of the book," said Taoufik Ben Amor, Columbia University senior lecturer in Arabic studies. "Muslims can marry (Christians and Jews), trade, and coexist without forcing them to convert." What’s more relevant, some argued, is how most Muslims interpret the verse. Even though some radical Muslims may agree with Hannity’s interpretation, most moderate Muslims believe it’s a great thing to be friends with Jews and Christians, said Martha Schulte-Nafeh, University of Michigan Arabic program director. The quote Hannity pulled is "not the normative understanding of how Muslims are with people of other faith," said Edgar Hopida, spokesman for the Islamic Society of North America. Our ruling In a segment condemning Boko Haram, Hannity said the Koran contains a verse that "talks about don't take Christians and Jews as your friends." While some English translations of the Koran do include a similar phrase, some experts say Hannity is isolating the phrase out of its proper context. Also there is a debate if the true meaning of the passage is somehow altered in the translation itself. Much of the meaning depends on how people interpret scripture, which can be said for any spiritual text. Hannity’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.

pomt-07851	"If you shut down Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, it's estimated you'd have to add seven new lanes to I-95 to accommodate the increased traffic."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/11/joe-biden/joe-biden-says-closing-northeast-corridor-would-fo/	In a Feb. 8, 2011, speech at Philadelphia’s 30th Street Station, Vice President Joe Biden -- who as a U.S. senator commuted almost daily to and from his home in Delaware using Amtrak -- touted rail as an integral part of the nation’s transportation future. During his address, he made a striking comment: "If you shut down Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, it's estimated you'd have to add seven new lanes to I-95 to accommodate the increased traffic." (It wasn’t the first time he made the comparison; he also included in an article he wrote for Amtrak’s Arrive magazine.) For readers who hail from outside the northeastern U.S., we should explain what the Northeast Corridor is. Though definitions vary, the one we’ll use is the passenger rail line Amtrak uses from Washington, D.C., to Boston, with stops in such major cities as Baltimore; Wilmington, Del.; Philadelphia and New York. It is heavily trafficked by commuters and inter-city travelers -- more than 10 million riders in 2010. Interstate 95 runs from Maine to Florida. The relevant portion for Biden’s comment is the stretch that mirrors the Northeast Corridor, running from Washington north to Boston. When we asked Biden’s office to back up the claim, they said that the numbers came from the Transportation Department. Specifically, Biden’s office said, 5 billion passenger miles are traveled in the Northeast Corridor every day by rail, including both intercity rail and commuter rail, with an additional 14.5 billion vehicle miles traveled on I-95 between Washington, D.C., and New York City. Using these numbers, Biden’s office said, eliminating all trips by rail could increase volume on I-95 by 23 percent. Biden's office added that the claim factors in population growth over the next 40 years, which is projected to increase volume on I-95 by 80 percent. So the combination of eliminating rail and accommodating future growth would result in roughly a doubling of demand on I-95. Accommodating that demand during peak periods would require a doubling of I-95’s current average size of seven lanes between Washington and New York City. Steven E. Polzin, director of mobility policy for the Center for Urban Transportation Research at the University of South Florida, consented to do his own back-of-the-envelope analysis for us, using a different methodology. He said that a freeway lane can handle 1,800 to 2,000 cars per hour. If each car holds the national average of 1.6 people per vehicle, that means that each lane can accommodate up to 3,200 persons per hour. An eight-coach, two-locomotive Amtrak train has a capacity of 400 riders. So Amtrak would would need to run eight trains per hour to equal the capacity of one freeway lane. (That's more than actually run now: Amtrak often runs two trains an hour from Boston to Washington and another two in the opposite direction, plus some additional trains that travel shorter portions.) Using current Amtrak ridership numbers, Polzin got a similar result -- that eliminating Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor would require one new lane in each direction. Either way, it’s less than one-third of what the Transportation Department study suggests. "That suggests that the seven-lane number uses some real different assumptions," Polzin said. For instance, he said, if you use Amtrak’s 2050 ridership projections, if you assume that all riders go the entire length of the corridor and if demand tends to highly concentrated in a peak hour, "one could get to three lanes in each direction. But that’s a lot of unlikely ifs." Indeed, our sources raised some questions about Biden’s explanation. • Was Biden in his statement sufficiently clear that he meant future traffic loads? When we and several of our experts first read his comment, we assumed he meant that shifting the current train passenger loads to I-95 would require seven new lanes. But Biden’s office clarified that he was referring to both current and future loads. The statement is not phrased incorrectly, but we think it could have been made more precise. • How reliable are the study’s assumptions about rates of growth? The Transportation Department estimated future growth using two different approaches -- projecting travel based on Census data and using travel growth estimates from state departments of transportation. But projections over several decades come with significant uncertainty, so we are taking them with a grain of salt. • Does Biden’s calculation include traffic on regional commuter lines? In his statement, Biden said that shifting Amtrak passenger loads would cause the seven-lane increase. But commuter lines such as MARC, New Jersey Transit and SEPTA also use the corridor, and the Transportation Department confirmed that its study factored in commuter line ridership as well. Commuter lines are far from a trivial factor. Commuter rail trips in the corridor actually exceed Amtrak’s by roughly a 20-to-1 margin, although the two are similar in terms of total miles traveled, since commuter trips are typically shorter than Amtrak jaunts. We think most people would assume that Biden’s reference to shutting down "Amtrak's Northeast Corridor" referred only to Amtrak trains. Rail experts (like Biden) may know that closing down one system likely means closing down the other, but we don’t think the average listener would. So we think Biden erred in failing to mention commuter lines alongside Amtrak in his speech. • Does Biden’s calculation assume that all the rail traffic will shift to I-95? Some of the longer-distance traffic is likely to shift to airplanes -- a factor the Transportation Department confirmed did not play into its study. The problem is that the "real impact" of shutting down the Northeast Corridor could be felt in the already-congested airports in and around New York, said Robert Puentes, a transportation scholar at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. We should note that Biden did mention the potential impact on airports in a subsequent portion of his Philadelphia speech. But factoring air travel into the statistics about adding lanes would almost certainly have changed the mathematics. • Does Biden’s calculation take into consideration how people actually ride the Northeast Corridor? Say 10,000 riders travel from from Boston to New York, another 10,000 riders travel from New York to Philadelphia and 10,000 riders travel from Philadelphia to Washington. These would be counted as 30,000 riders, and their miles traveled would be lumped together. However, the the impact of switching them to I-95 would only add 10,000 lane trips, not 30,000. So where does this leave us? Biden based his comment on a professionally done, federally sponsored study. However, experts note methodological shortcomings, notably that the study does not factor in air travel, and they offer alternative models that suggest less drastic shifts than seven-lane increases. In addition, Biden compounded these uncertainties by his framing of the study. We don’t think the average person would have assumed he was talking about shutting down commuter rail systems as well as Amtrak. On balance, we rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11865	"California Democrat Maxine Waters charged on 3 counts."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2017/nov/02/blog-posting/us-rep-maxine-waters-charged-3-ethics-violations-b/	Internet posts claiming that U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., is facing corruption charges neglects to tell readers the incident is seven years old and that the charges were dropped. "California Democrat Maxine Waters charged on 3 counts," read the headline on an Oct. 6, 2017, post on NewsOfTrump.com. The headline added a hallmark of fake news sites looking to engage an audience, asking readers, "Do you support this?" Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to curb fake news. The same subject came up on other websites, as well. The NewsOfTrump.com post didn’t mention the charges in the headline, but specified in the text that she violated House rules by arranging a 2008 "meeting between the Treasury Department and representatives of OneUnited bank — where her husband was a notable shareholder." The post criticized Waters for being corrupt and said OneUnited directly benefitted from her actions. "As a member of the House Financial Committee, she was able to directly contact then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to speak with him about meeting with minority-owned banks," the post read. "Through her efforts, OneUnited bank was able to obtain $12 million in federal bailout funding to help cover expected losses from the collapse of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac." These posts describe real events, when the House ethics committee charged Waters with breaking three rules by allegedly trying to assist OneUnited, in which her husband did hold a sizeable share of stock. But the flap over the OneUnited meeting happened in 2010. Reports surfaced in 2009 that Waters had allegedly helped OneUnited CEO Kevin Cohee secure a meeting to ask for $50 million in bailout funds to recover from the Great Recession, triggering a House ethics investigation. (The bank did get $12 million.) In August 2010, the panel recommended three charges against Waters for violating ethics rules that essentially are supposed to keep members of Congress from making the House look bad. Her chief of staff, Mikael Moore, also was charged. But the posts implied or outright said that Waters is currently facing charges, making it seem as if the House had only now acted on the 2008 meeting. They also don’t mention that the ethics charges against Waters were dropped in 2012. In contentious action between Republican and Democratic members of the committee, a lawyer hired specifically to review the case found that Waters believed she had been acting in the interest of all minority-owned banks, not just OneUnited. She had called for a meeting to help those banks, and ended her involvement when she learned OneUnited was part of the group. Moore was given a letter of reproval for the incident, for not stopping Waters’ involvement once it was clear OneUnited was one of the banks asking for help. Waters is a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, which no doubt was what has earned her the attention of fake news purveyors, who typically zero in on political flashpoints. She recently earned criticism for saying she wanted to "take Trump out" and called him "the most dishonorable and despicable human being to ever serve in the office of the president." Although based on things that really happened, the fake news posts distort the timeline and leave out the final result of the House ethics committee investigation. Someone reading it would be misinformed of the events. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-05977	Newt Gingrich says electric co-ops and credit unions are "government-sponsored enterprises" like Freddie Mac.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/23/newt-gingrich/gingrich-repeats-claim-freddie-mac-credit-unions-a/	Often criticized for his lucrative work for Freddie Mac, Newt Gingrich has compared the mortgage giant to government-sponsored enterprises such as credit unions and electric co-ops. He said it again in a debate in Tampa on Jan. 23, 2012, in an effort to portray Freddie, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Association, as a benign entity that serves citizens -- not an out-of-control bureaucracy that brought down the housing market, as his rivals maintain. "Government-sponsored enterprises include, for example, telephone cooperatives, rural electric cooperatives, federal credit unions. There are many different kinds of government-sponsored enterprises, and many of them have done very good things," said Gingrich, who collected more than $1.6 million in fees from the federally chartered mortgage company. PolitiFact has checked Gingrich's claim that electric coops and credit unions are government-sponsored enterprises and found it’s not true. In the last debate before the Iowa caucuses, Gingrich had to explain another wrinkle in his past dealings with Freddie. One of the panelists asked him about his words from 2007: "I like the GSE, or government-sponsored enterprise like Freddie Mac, model." Gingrich defended his position, much the same way in that debate, saying "when you look for example at electric membership co-ops, and you look at credit unions, there are a lot of government-sponsored enterprises that are awfully important and do an awfully good job." How valid is the comparison? There is one similarity between a GSE and a credit union or an electric co-op. Neither pays federal or state income taxes. But Patrick Lavigne, spokesman for the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA), said GSE "is not a term that I’ve heard applied to electric coops before." In fact, the term GSE applies to just a handful of very particular institutions. It takes a specific act of Congress to create one, usually to ease the flow of money to a certain industry, like housing or agriculture. Glossaries like Investopedia define GSE’s as "(p)rivately held corporations with public purposes created by the U.S. Congress to reduce the cost of capital for certain borrowing sectors of the economy." When the White House submits its annual budget, it includes the GSE’s, and the list isn’t long. There are the Agricultural Credit Bank and Farm Credit Banks, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation. And that’s it. No electric co-ops. No credit unions. The 2012 White House budget explains that Congress chartered Freddie Mac in 1970 to facilitate "the flow of investment dollars from the capital markets to mortgage lenders and ultimately, to homebuyers." A credit union or an electric co-op is created completely differently. They come into being when a group of local investors pool their money. The country’s very first credit union was started in 1908 by a priest in Manchester, N.H., to provide credit to factory workers in textile mills. Washington played no role at all. Later, the federal government offered both funding assistance and regulatory guidelines. Local co-ops and credit unions need to apply to a government agency for recognition as a nonprofit, member-owed entities. And that’s another difference. Freddie Mac is owned by stockholders. Co-ops are owned by members, the people who use them. Levine, with the NRECA, says electric co-ops started in the 1930s when "farmers would each throw $5 into the hat and then ask Washington for a loan for a transformer or some power lines." Back then, and today, those loans would come with a very low interest rate, but Freddie Mac was treated even more favorably. It was formed with a direct line of credit from the federal Treasury for more than $2 billion. "They could borrow money cheaper than anyone except Uncle Sam himself," said Kathleen Day, a former Washington Post reporter who covered GSE’s for over two decades. The deal for Freddie Mac got even better. Thanks to that intimate association with the federal government, Day says "the markets perceived them as something that was backed by Washington and invested at a very low cost ... That’s what allowed it to grow." Our ruling Gingrich spoke of credit unions and electric cooperatives as if they were the same sort of entities as Freddie Mac. We find no support for that and do find major differences in how they are created and operate compared with GSEs. Congress created Freddie Mac, as it does every GSE, by passing a specific law to bring it into being. Freddie Mac has stockholders and a direct line of credit with the U.S. Treasury. The term, Government Sponsored Enterprise, applies only to a handful of financial entities listed in the federal budget. None of those characteristics apply to credit unions and electric cooperatives. Once again, we rate Gingrich’s statement Pants On Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/97867b65-b96a-435e-9e0d-1f2ac55a5f4f	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2012-01-23T23:07:39	2012-01-23	['Freddie_Mac', 'Newt_Gingrich']
pomt-06123	"Fifty percent of Speaker Gingrich’s tax plan goes to the top 1 percent."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/28/barack-obama/obama-campaign-says-half-benefit-newt-gingrichs-ta/	President Barack Obama’s campaign managers spoke the language of the Occupy Wall Street movement last week when they took aim at the tax plan introduced by Republican candidate Newt Gingrich. "Speaker Gingrich supports the Republican budget plan that would … provide more tax breaks to millionaires, billionaires and large corporations and make the middle class foot the bill," Obama spokesman Ben LaBolt said Tuesday, Dec. 20, 2011, in a conference call with New Hampshire reporters. "Fifty percent of Speaker Gingrich’s tax plan goes to the top 1 percent," LaBolt said. (We're following our practice of attributing this claim to Obama because LaBolt was acting as a spokesman for the campaign, not speaking on his own.) Gingrich’s tax plan would cut the corporate income tax in half and would introduce a 15 percent flat tax option for all taxpayers. But would 50 percent of the benefits really go to the top 1 percent of income earners? To find the answer, the Obama campaign's press office pointed us to the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research group in Washington that recently issued a report analyzing the Gingrich tax plan. The Tax Policy Center, which has also evaluated proposals by Rick Perry and Herman Cain, among others, concluded that Gingrich’s plan would reduce total U.S. tax revenues by as much as 35 percent by 2015, the first full year the plan could be implemented. But analysts made a number of assumptions to reach these figures. First, the report assumed that those U.S. taxpayers who would see lower tax bills under Gingrich’s flat tax option, about 70 percent of taxpayers, would enroll in the plan. Also, the report assumes that tax policies currently in place, including the Bush-era tax cuts, will be extended at least through 2015. That's based on the predictions of most analysts, who expect Congress to continue extending them. (The center’s calculations do not, however, include the current payroll tax cut, which Gingrich has said he would phase out.) It’s this second assumption that is key to the Obama administration’s 50 percent figure. If the Bush cuts and other current tax policies are allowed to expire, then the Gingrich plan would cut tax revenues by about $1.3 trillion in 2015, and the top 1 percent of income earners would receive 41.6 percent of those savings, paying an average of $422,298 less in taxes. Under these parameters, the bottom 20 percent of income earners would take in 1 percent of the total savings, paying an average of $289 less, according to the center's calculations. Assuming, however, that the current tax policies continue, as most analysts suggest, the Gingrich plan would cut tax revenues by about $850 million by 2015, and about half of those savings would fall to the top 1 percent, the report concludes. Under the plan, the top earners would pay an average of $340,203 in tax under Gingrich’s plan, making up 50.1 percent of the total tax cuts. By contrast, the lowest 20 percent of income earners would pay an average of $63 less, comprising less than 1 percent of the total savings. "The wealthy get far and away the biggest benefits" of the Gingrich plan, said Roberton Williams, an analyst at the Tax Policy Center. To this point, Chris Edwards, tax policy director at the libertarian Cato Institute, notes that many such tax reform plans appear to benefit the wealthiest Americans because they are already paying taxes at a much higher rate. Currently, the top 1 percent of income earners are paying tax rates as high as 35 percent. The average federal rate for that group is 29.8 percent. Under Gingrich’s plan, it would fall to 12.8 percent, according to the Tax Policy Center report. The average federal tax rate for the lowest 20 percent of income earners would fall from 2 percent to 1.4 percent. Edwards said that would correct the current disparity that makes the wealthy shoulder too large a tax burden. "Even with the Gingrich cut, the people at the top end are still going to be paying substantially higher rates." The benefits to the country’s top earners don’t stop with the tax rate, however, Williams points out. Among other elements of the tax plan, Gingrich also proposes to eliminate taxes on capital gains, dividends and interest, among others. He says they are "the winners" of the Gingrich plan. Representatives from the Gingrich campaign didn’t return requests for comment this week. But, campaign staff told CNN Money that the Tax Policy Center analysis didn’t take into consideration the economic growth likely to result from the tax plan. They said the tax plan is part of a larger 10-year plan to balance the federal budget. Williams, of the Tax Policy Center, acknowledged that his analysis does not factor in economic growth, because that is difficult to calculate, he said. But, with the loss of $850 billion in tax revenue, the economy would have to grow at an extreme and unlikely rate to make up the losses, Williams said. "Economists generally agree that cutting taxes and making them flatter will improve economic growth. The question we disagree on is how much faster it will grow," he said. "It’s hard to see how the economy will grow fast enough to make up all the revenue losses." Our ruling The Obama campaign said "50 percent of Speaker Gingrich’s tax plan goes to the top 1 percent." The analysis of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center backs up that claim -- as long as current tax policies continue, which is what most analysts expect. As long as they are, the country’s wealthiest 1 percent would indeed receive about half of the savings under Gingrich’s plan. Still, the share would fall to 41.6 percent if the Bush cuts and other current tax policies are allowed to expire. That isn't likely to happen, but Congress will have to act to extend them. So we rate the Obama campaign's claim Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-12-28T13:09:49	2011-12-20	['None']
pomt-09765	"The richest 1 percent have more financial wealth than the bottom 95 percent combined."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/01/michael-moore/moore-says-top-1-percent-owns-more-financial-wealt/	In his new movie Capitalism: A Love Story , liberal provocateur Michael Moore tries to build a case that the rich keep getting richer while everyone else is left behind. One statistic he cites in the film, which he repeated at a Sept. 29, 2009, news conference in Washington, is that "the richest 1 percent have more financial wealth than the bottom 95 percent combined." On his Web site, Moore provides a list of sources to back up his claims. For this one, the filmmaker cites a memo written by Citigroup's research staff — a memo that plays a key role in the film as a symbol of Wall Street excess. The Citigroup document, which was provided to PolitiFact by Moore's staff, cites a table using statistics assembled by New York University and Bard College economist Edward N. Wolff. Wolff uses Federal Reserve Board findings on family wealth drawn from the Survey of Consumer Finances, a once-every-three-years study. The Citigroup document uses numbers from the 2001 survey. But before we look at the data, let's parse Moore's words closely. He didn't say the top 1 percent have "more wealth" than the bottom 95 percent. Nor did he say that they have more income than the bottom 95 percent. Rather, he specifically said they have more "financial wealth." So what is financial wealth? That's subject to debate. Wolff uses two key measurements of wealth. One is net worth, which means someone's total assets minus total liabilities. Net worth includes cash holdings, financial assets like stocks and bonds, real estate, the value of life insurance policies and retirement plans, equity from unincorporated businesses, and the value of trust funds. The amount owed from mortgages and consumer debt are subtracted from this amount, while household appliances and the future value of Social Security benefits and private pension plans are kept out of the calculations, because they cannot be easily converted into cash. Wolff's second measurement is called either "financial wealth" (as Citigroup's memo labeled it) or "non-home wealth" (as Wolff himself called it in a 2007 paper analyzing the Fed survey data). Put simply, it's net worth minus the net equity of one's home. Wolff justifies separating out house equity for two reasons. One is that it is not easy to convert a home to cash on short notice. The other is that primary homes serve a dual purpose — they provide shelter as well as storing wealth. In the news conference, Moore correctly reported what the Citigroup memo said about the second category, financial wealth. According to the document, which uses numbers from the 2001 Fed survey, the top 1 percent owned 39.7 percent of the financial wealth, while the bottom 95 percent owned 32.5 percent. Because the Fed has released two surveys since its 2001 study, we wanted to see whether the same pattern has held. In his 2007 paper, Wolff used 2004 survey data, which found that the top 1 percent owned 42.2 percent of the non-home wealth, compared to 31 percent for the bottom 95 percent. Once again, Moore's right. We crunched the raw numbers using the 2007 survey data, which had been published in early 2009. Moore is right again: the top 1 percent held 48.4 percent of non-home wealth, compared to 20 percent for the bottom 95 percent. For the second straight survey, in fact, the concentration of wealth increased. So Moore's right? Not so fast. Arthur B. Kennickell, a Fed economist, periodically publishes papers analyzing the survey statistics in great detail. In his most recent paper, published on Jan. 7, 2009, Kennickell provides a breakdown of dozens of key statistics based on income level. Deep inside his data-laden paper is a statistic called "financial wealth." That shares a name with the measurement Wolff used (and which was later cited by Citigroup and Moore) but Kennickell calculates it differently. "Financial wealth," as defined in Kennickell's paper, starts with Wolff's measurement but then subtracts several other categories, including vehicles (not just cars but also boats, airplanes and helicopters); other real estate held (including equity in second homes); the equity from closely held businesses; and the value of antiques, artwork and similar items. These mathematical differences are enough to switch Moore's assertion from correct to incorrect. By Kennickell's measurement of "financial wealth," the top 1 percent own 31.5 percent of the financial wealth — less than the 40.2 percent for the bottom 95 percent. That indicates a large chunk of the wealth for the top 1 percent comes from vehicles, second homes, businesses and hobbies. (We presume it's the top 1 percent that owns the Ferraris and summer homes in the Hamptons.) Moore deserves credit for correctly reporting the Citigroup statistic, and the data it's based on — both the Fed survey and Wolff's analysis — are respected. But this comparison shows that you can crunch numbers different ways and get different results. Indeed, Alan Reynolds, a scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, expresses skepticism of most narrower definitions of "wealth," suggesting that removing factors like home equity — a more widely held asset than stocks and bonds — biases these calculations. In fact, Moore would be wrong if he used the broader category of net worth to make his assertion. According to the 2004 Fed survey, the top 1 percent held 34.3 percent of the nation's net worth, compared to a collective 41 percent for the bottom 95 percent. (In fact, Moore or his staff was careful enough to actually correct a mistake that Citigroup had made on this point; the memo had said, incorrectly, that the top 1 percent possessed greater net worth than the bottom 95 percent.) Moore's camp emphasizes that however you slice the numbers, the richest Americans continue to hold a disproportionate share of the wealth — and on this point, other experts concur. "The important point is that there's an enormous disparity" in wealth in the United States, said Brookings Institution scholar Ron Haskins. The Fed survey may actually understate the true concentration of wealth. The survey specifically excludes members of the Forbes 400 richest families in America. Because "the closer you get to the top, the bigger the disparity" between rich and poor, a lot of concentrated wealth gets left out, Haskins said. (The new version of Forbes' list, released on Oct. 1, 2009, found that the collective worth of the 400 richest families fell $300 billion compared to the previous year; if the wealth of slightly less rich households also decreased, that could change the numbers.) So let's recap. Moore correctly cited the Citigroup memo's contents, and on the larger question, he's correct that the richest 1 percent of Americans own a vastly disproportionate share of the nation's wealth. But we'll take him down a notch because, using another methodology, his statement would not be correct. So we rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-04042	Says Oak Grove is "one of the largest cities in Oregon" and is "the biggest city in Clackamas County and it's not a city."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2013/jan/30/charlotte-lehan/oak-grove-one-largest-cities-oregon-clackamas-coun/	In an exit interview with The Oregonian, outgoing Clackamas County board chairwoman Charlotte Lehan was asked what she would have done differently while in office. "I've been asked that question before, so I've thought about it quite a bit. The only thing I can think of is the work we did on Oak Grove on the tree ordinance," she said. Some people from that part of unincorporated Clackamas County wanted a tree ordinance, but Lehan says the county should not have helped. Why? Because that’s work cities do, and if anything, the county should have helped launch "Oak Grove into its own city-hood" so it could pass its own tree ordinance. "They are way too big, they are one of the largest cities in Oregon. They should be a powerhouse in Oregon. They should have a faction at the county level, the state level and the city level," she said. Later, in the interview, she said, "It's the biggest city in Clackamas County and it's not a city." That we had a potential city this large in Clackamas County was news to us. We wanted to know: If incorporated, would Oak Grove be the largest city in Clackamas County? Would it be one of the largest cities in Oregon? Oak Grove has a cinema and a market center. Its population in 2010 was 16,629, according to the U.S. Census. That didn’t sound very large to us, so we consulted our colleagues who cover the county. And it turns out that county insiders all know that Oak Grove is more than just Oak Grove when talking about the controversial topic of incorporation. A group called Friends of Local Control has wanted to incorporate the areas of Oak Grove, Jennings Lodge and Oatfield, although they’ve never gotten so far as to draw boundaries. However, the area in question is roughly the area served by the Oak Lodge Water District and last we heard, residents surveyed wanted little to do with incorporation and any new city fees that would bring. Let’s flesh out the estimated population of this city-in-waiting. According to the Census, Jennings Lodge had a population of 7,315 in 2010 and Oatfield had a population of 13,415. Add them all up, and a proposed city would have 37,359 residents. (This is the most recent year available for unincorporated census areas.) The largest city in Clackamas County is Lake Oswego, with 36,619 people in 2010 and an estimated 37,046in 2011, according to the U.S. Census. Oregon City, the county seat, had an estimated 32,500 people in 2012, compared with 36,770 for Lake Oswego. (The 2012 estimates are by Portland State University.) So the bottom line is that a new city of Oak Grove, Jennings Lodge and Oatfield would rival Lake Oswego as the most populous city in Clackamas County. Lehan is on the right track with that claim, if you keep in mind that Oak Grove is a sort of shorthand for a larger area. Now, what about the claim that the area in question is "one of the largest cities in Oregon?" Let’s look at the large-ish cities we do have, according to Portland State’s 2012 calculations and 2011 Census estimates. July 2012 PSU July 2011 Census Portland 587,865 593,820 Eugene 158,335 156,929 Salem 156,455 156,244 Gresham 105,970 107,439 Hillsboro 92,550 93,455 Beaverton 91,205 91,625 Bend 77,455 77,905 Medford 75,545 75,501 Springfield 59,840 59,695 Corvallis 55,055 54,674 Lake Oswego ranks No. 13 in both columns. Lehan said in an email to PolitiFact Oregon that she was referring to the "unincorporated, generally contiguous area that includes Clackamas, Jennings Lodge, Oak Grove, Oak Lodge, Oatfield and other neighboring neighborhoods." She estimates the total population at "nearly 40,000, putting it slightly ahead of Lake Oswego." (Oak Lodge Water commissioner Jim Knapp, who disapproves of incorporation, does not contest her number.) She also said that there are 242 incorporated cities in Oregon. A mythical new city of Oak Grove would be 13th or 14th. "If it were anywhere in the top 15, or even the top 20, out of 242 cities I would not consider it to be inaccurate to say it is among Oregon's largest cities," she wrote. We can see her point of view. On the other hand, Oregon is a state of small towns and cities, so it’s not that hard to crack the top 20. According to Portland State, 214 of 242 cities are under 20,000 people. Lehan said in her exit interview that Oak Grove "should be up there with Gresham and Beaverton and Hillsboro and they aren't." Maybe Oak Grove should be a bigger power player in the tri-county region, but population-wise, it’s simply not on par with the Washington County cities of Hillsboro or Beaverton, or Gresham in east Multnomah County. And really, Oak Grove pales next to the 49,425 residents in the unincorporated "census designated place" of Aloha in Washington County. Where does that leave us ruling-wise? Well, we understand that Lehan was speaking with a county readership in mind, using geographic shorthand to describe an issue familiar to some people in Clackamas County. But it’s our job to rate statements for a general readership. First, estimates show that a new Oak Grove city would rival Lake Oswego for the honor of largest city in Clackamas County, but we don’t have an apples to apples count. The most recent numbers for the pretend city is from 2010, and a population count would depend on the precision of new boundaries. Second, if incorporated, the city would land in the top 15 most populous cities in Oregon -- but the statement is missing information on just how small it would be compared with other large cities. The cities she names -- Beaverton, Gresham and Hillsboro -- are twice the size. Third, Oak Grove itself has fewer than 20,000 people. Words matter to PolitiFact Oregon and here, she didn’t spell out the larger geographical area. We rate Lehan’s statement Half True. It is partially accurate but leaves out a cumulation of important details.	None	Charlotte Lehan	None	None	None	2013-01-30T03:00:00	2013-01-08	['Oregon']
pomt-12613	"Florida Sheriff: Blacks should learn to act like white people in order to stay alive."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2017/apr/02/blog-posting/did-florida-sheriff-say-blacks-should-learn-act-wh/	Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan has shared controversial thoughts on race, crime and African-American culture in a couple of videos. But he didn't go as far as some blogs would have you believe. The video clips have circulated across the Internet for years under this headline: "Florida Sheriff: Blacks should learn to act like white people in order to stay alive." We noticed the headline on Aazah, a news and entertainment website for LGBTQ persons of color. Facebook flagged a post with the misleading headline as part of its efforts to identify fake news. In this case the headline is misleading, but the contents of the story are not necessarily fake. The spliced video clips of Morgan first circulated about four years ago, said Amber Southard, a spokeswoman for Morgan, who was re-elected to a third term in November 2016. "Nowhere in the video does he say" what the headline says, she said. Morgan has been in the news for controversial statements or practices involving African-Americans, but the claim that he did made the statement in the headline is wrong. We didn’t hear that statement in the videos, and we searched for it in Nexis and found no evidence that Morgan said it. We attempted to reach someone at the website where we saw this headline and were unsuccessful. We can’t fully evaluate Morgan’s comments because they appear to stem from partial videos and not full speeches. However, here is a summary of what he did say in the clips with some added context from other news accounts. PolitiFact Florida examined the origins of this claim as part of the inaugural International Fact-Checking Day, April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.org describe the day as "not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts -- and fact-checking -- in politics, journalism, and everyday life." ‘Let me take issue with the title of African-American' In the first video clip, Morgan appears to be speaking in a sheriff’s office. "First off, let me take issue with the title of ‘African-American,’" Morgan begins. "We’re Americans." Morgan then explains that he is "fourth-generation Welsh" and doesn’t refer to himself as a "Welsh-American." "I was not born in Wales and the blacks that currently reside in the United States of America are not from Africa," he says. "Those sorts of terms that society has come to use are divisive in nature." Morgan then says many issues in the minority community in Escambia County are real while "most of them are perceived." Morgan then says that not that many years ago, the thought of an African-American president would have been unthinkable but Barack Obama won election twice by getting the votes of people of various races -- not just blacks. "If we’re such a racist nation, why do we currently have an African-American president?" he says. The video shows Morgan offering his critique of the black community: "We have unfortunately in the black community embraced a thug culture -- one that aggrandizes, again, foul language, shooting cops, abusing women and if you don’t think those things have an effect on our children, you need to get a grip." Cites black-on-white crime incidents One of the video clips appears to come from part of a speech that Morgan made at a Rotary Club meeting in August 2013. His speech followed an incident in which two white Escambia deputies shot an unarmed black man who was looking for cigarettes in his mother’s car parked in his driveway. The deputies fired multiple rounds and two bullets struck 60-year-old Roy Middleton, shattering his leg. The deputies were responding to a burglary call. (A grand jury later found insufficient evidence to prosecute the officers but called for more intensive training for deputies.) The video clip circulating on the Internet shows Morgan recounting three violent crime incidents that involved black perpetrators and white victims. "Last night we had four black male teenagers attack a 77-year-old white man," he said. "Where is the public outrage in that?" He also recounted a homicide in which he said three black people beat a white woman to death and a time a black man shot an unarmed white man "execution style." Morgan then calls for "equality across the board" and calls for working together with families, schools and churches to bring back "character and integrity to our communities." He says that criminologists have identified the "rise of the superpredators" -- people who are "not tethered to faith, family, religion or community." "It's about me, it's about my personal wants, needs and desires to the exclusion of anyone and everything and most assuredly institutions," he said. We read news articles about other portions of Morgan’s speech that were not included in the video clips. "I'll share with you a political axiom that I think is appropriate today for what the Escambia County Sheriff's Office is currently facing," he said, according to the Pensacola News Journal. "When forced to swallow (excrement) ... it is recommended to swallow it whole and for God's sake, don't chew it. We've been handed a couple of these here recently, and I'm doing my best to choke them down." (Slate wrote that the word Morgan used was "turds.") The audience laughed, and Morgan then discussed the apparent "lack of race relations" in the county. "I was of the opinion, until just recently, that we have built some bridges in the community, and obviously we have not," he said. "No one is more appalled by this than I ... I will also tell you that we intend to stay the course." Our ruling A headline that appeared on many websites quoted a Florida sheriff as saying "blacks should learn to act like white people in order to stay alive." The articles include video clips of Escambia Sheriff David Morgan giving a Rotary Club address about black-on-white crime and the local outrage over the shooting of a black man by two white police officers. The stories use real quotes from Morgan, but not the one given most prominence in the headline. We listened to the clips and did not hear Morgan make that particular statement. We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1d46c2ae-c833-4c94-a019-b178dee9924d	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2017-04-02T08:00:00	2015-04-26	['None']
pomt-06947	"Fracturing or horizontally fracturing the shale to open up larger pockets of natural gas ... has been used for over 60 years and, as of 2009, over 80,000 wells have been fracked in Ohio."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/jul/19/kris-jordan/state-sen-kris-jordan-says-fracking-has-been-used-/	During a recent debate in the Ohio Senate over a proposed law to allow drilling at state parks, some lawmakers focused on fracking, an increasingly controversial technique used to extract oil and gas from underground. Republican Sen. Kris Jordan was among those to defend process. He questioned why Democrats and others were so worried, considering fracking’s long history in Ohio. "The process of fracturing or horizontally fracking the shale to open up larger pockets of natural gas in order to make it financially feasible to drill the wells – this process has been used for over 60 years and, as of 2009, over 80,000 wells have been fracked in Ohio," Jordan said on the Senate floor on June 15. Considering that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is studying hydraulic fracturing’s effects on drinking water and since fracking will remain a topic of interest as more oil and gas companies are expected to tap Ohio’s natural gas deposits, PolitiFact Ohio decided to look at Jordan’s claim. So what is fracking? Fracking -- hydraulic fracturing -- is a technique that uses a combination of water, sand and chemicals to free up natural gas or oil beneath the surface. First, a well is drilled. Then, the fluid is shot down the well at high pressure, causing rock formations to crack and release natural gas or oil. The fracking fluid is then either recycled, stored in deep underground wells or treated. Concerns over fracking have grown lately for a variety of reasons. Chesapeake Energy temporarily halted fracking operations in Bradford County, Pa., after a well blew out in April, causing thousands of gallons of fracking fluid to spill into a nearby waterway. Such incidents have coincided with the increased popularity of the "Gasland," a documentary made in 2010, which attempts to show the environmental dangers of fracking, including a scene about flammable tap water. We called Jordan to find out more about fracking in Ohio. He said his information came from Thomas Stewart, the Ohio Oil and Gas Association’s executive vice president and lobbyist. "I’ll trust him as one of the experts," Jordan said. Indeed, we found an April interview in which Stewart said pretty much the same thing as Jordan: "We’ve been fracturing wells in the state of Ohio since the early 1950s. There’s been over 80,000 wells hydraulically fractured in the state of Ohio," Stewart said then. According to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, which regulates oil and gas drilling in Ohio, hydraulic fracturing in Ohio began 59 years ago in 1952. From that year to 2009, 80,306 wells were hydraulically fractured. So it appears Jordan is pretty much on the mark. He was a little off when he said fracking has occurred for more than 60 years, the fact remains the technique has been around for decades. But Jordan’s and Stewart’s statements are not exactly the same. The difference highlights environmentalists’ growing concerns. Jordan mentioned "horizontal" fracturing while Stewart made no such distinction. Stewart actually discussed the differences between vertical and horizontal fracturing in his April interview. Horizontal fracturing is related to horizontal drilling, a newer drilling method in which a well is first drilled vertically into the ground, then horizontally for thousands of feet. This allows drillers to access more underground resources through a single vertical well. Of the more than 80,000 Ohio wells that have been fracked, 39 have been horizontally fractured, according to ODNR. The overwhelming majority of fracturing jobs have been for vertical wells. An ODNR geologist and the Ohio Oil and Gas Association say both vertical and horizontal fracturing are equally safe when properly regulated. But to environmentalists, the difference is important. Ellen Mee, director of environmental health policy for the Ohio Environmental Council, said the more recent, horizontal fracturing method is more dangerous because it uses more water and more chemicals to extract the gas. And the fracking fluid is shot at a higher pressure. Mee also noted recent accidents at sites conducting horizontal fracking – a preferred method to extract natural gas from shale formations around Pennsylvania and New York. "The difference is really quite significant," Mee said. "We’re really talking about a significantly risky endeavor." Tom Tomastik, an ODNR geologist, disagreed. He said the potential for problems are the same. Tomastik said past problems with hydraulic fracturing in Ohio were due to faulty well construction rather than perceived flaws in the fracking process. Tomastik said the media has irresponsibly hyped the dangers of fracking. "It’s made it look like this technology is hazardous and causes all kinds of problems when we can demonstrate that it hasn’t," Tomastik said. In a fact sheet available online, ODNR stresses that none of its water well investigations since 1990 have uncovered problems caused by hydraulic fracturing. The fact sheet also addresses fears that fracking could contaminate drinking waters. It is "impossible for frack fluid to travel upward thousands of feet, or between rock formations and into freshwater aquifers," according to the ODNR. A recent study by Duke University researchers did show that houses near sites that used horizontal fracturing to extract natural gas in New York and Pennsylvania were more likely to have methane contamination in drinking water systems. But the study failed to directly connect the contamination to fracking activity. "More research is needed across this and other regions to determine the mechanism(s) controlling the higher methane concentrations we observed," the report said. Where does that leave Jordan’s claim? Jordan correctly cites the statistic for the number of times hydraulic fracturing has been used on wells in Ohio. And while he overstated the time frame slightly, he wasn’t off by much. His underlying point, though, was that hydraulic fracturing is not new to Ohio and, he argues, that the technique is relatively safe. But he specifically mentioned horizontal fracturing, which is a much newer technique. When we asked him about the discrepancy, Jordan said he assumed all the fracturing in Ohio was horizontal. "Maybe I didn’t ask if it was horizontal or vertical," Jordan said. That’s an important fact to know, especially since the state says horizontal fracturing has only been used 39 times in Ohio. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate the statement Half True. Comment on this item.	None	Kris Jordan	None	None	None	2011-07-19T06:00:00	2011-06-15	['Ohio']
pomt-13979	"30,000 Arizonans may have no choice" on Affordable Care Act coverage.	mostly true	/arizona/statements/2016/jun/10/john-mccain/mccain-ad-claims-arizonans-affordable-care-act/	Sen. John McCain has picked up his attacks on the Affordable Care Act recently, making the law synonymous with his Democratic rival, U.S. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick of Flagstaff. A May 17 attack ad from McCain against Kirkpatrick, who’s running for McCain’s Senate seat, is a case in point. In addition to the claim that the healthcare law is her "proudest" vote, the ad’s on-screen text states, "30,000 Arizonans may have no choice" for healthcare coverage, citing the departure of UnitedHealthCare, the nation’s largest insurer, from the state’s marketplace. "That’s devastating, especially to rural counties," the ad’s narrator points out. While folks who have United will be insured through Dec. 31, 2016, we wondered whether thousands of Arizonans really won’t have a health care coverage choice come 2017. (No coverage results in a penalty.) Background United announced in April that it would stop Affordable Care Act coverage in Arizona - and most of the 34 states it has plans in - by year’s end. May 11 was the deadline for health insurers to submit their 2017 Affordable Care Act state coverage plans to the federal government, which runs HealthCare.gov. In eight rural Arizona counties - Cochise, Graham, Greenlee, La Paz, Pinal, Santa Cruz, Yavapai and Yuma - only one health insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield, signed up to cover individuals. Right now, only United and Blue Cross offer health insurance plans across all eight counties. How many insured people in these counties stand to be affected in 2017? Those are the people who will only get to choose Blue Cross. People insured may vary McCain campaign spokeswoman Lorna Romero pointed us to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services data for insured people in those eight counties. According to the data, 30,761 people across all eight counties bought coverage through the exchange as of Feb. 1, 2016. However, Allen Gjersvig, director of Enrollment Services at Arizona Alliance for Community Health Centers, a umbrella group for healthcare organizations that help people sign up for coverage, said the numbers do not specifically note how many people have either United or Blue Cross. "It’s a snapshot, we don’t know what plan they chose," Gjersvig said. We asked Blue Cross Blue Shield specifically how many people currently have health insurance plans - and what plans they expect to offer in 2017 - in those eight counties, but they declined to provide those details, citing the "competitive landscape." "There are counties and consumers that will, as it stands right now, see only one insurance company," Gjersvig said. "Blue Cross has filed rates for all counties in Arizona." It’s worth pointing out that health insurance coverage options in rural areas are limited overall. Insurers note that people in rural areas tend to be sicker and rack up more health care costs. But rural areas also have fewer physicians than urban areas. Our ruling McCain’s campaign ad said, "30,000 Arizonans may have no choice" for Affordable Care Act coverage. The 30,000 number is just a snapshot of how many people have bought coverage through the exchange in those eight Arizona counties. That could change, plus it's based on months old data. But, the ad’s claim is largely correct. In 2017, Blue Cross Blue Shield stands to be the lone health insurer for Arizonans seeking health insurance in those counties. We rate the ad’s claim as Mostly True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2016-06-10T20:00:00	2016-05-17	['None']
pomt-04913	"The judicial system is the most underfunded in this state, able to only pay 52 percent of its obligations. Meanwhile, judges get some of the richest pensions of all public employees."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/aug/02/shirley-turner/new-jersey-judges-pension-system-most-underfunded-/	Take a severely underfunded pension system, combined with some of the richest benefits paid to public employees, and according to state Sen. Shirley Turner, you’ve got a "recipe for disaster." That’s how Turner characterized the retirement system for New Jersey judges when state legislators returned to Trenton this week to ensure jurists contribute more toward their pensions and health benefits. The state Supreme Court recently ruled those higher payments unconstitutional. To counter that ruling, the state Legislature on Monday approved legislation placing a question on the November ballot to amend the state constitution and allow the greater contributions. "The judicial system is the most underfunded in this state, able to only pay 52 percent of its obligations. Meanwhile, judges get some of the richest pensions of all public employees," Turner (D-Mercer), who sponsored the legislation, said during a speech on the Senate floor. "That mixture of underfunding and high benefit is a sure recipe for disaster, both for the jurists promised the pension and also our hard-working taxpayers who would be on the hook if this system fails." As PolitiFact New Jersey learned, Turner’s recipe isn’t missing any ingredients. Of the five major pension funds, the Judicial Retirement System has the lowest percentage of funds necessary to meet future pension obligations, according to the latest data from the state Department of the Treasury. At the same time, judges, on average, are receiving the largest annual pensions of all public employees in those systems, according to Treasury data. First, let’s address how the Judicial Retirement System is underfunded. As of July 1, 2011, the system had about $305 million in assets, but had accrued nearly $586 million in long-term liabilities. In other words, the state only had roughly 52 percent of the money needed to fulfill its obligations. That percentage represents the lowest amount of the five major pension funds. Now, we’ll talk about the pension amounts paid to judges. The average annual benefit among all retirees in the Judicial Retirement System was $90,837 as of July 1, 2011, and more than $100,000 for those who retired in the preceding year. Those pensions represent the highest benefits among public employees in the five major systems. By comparison, the Public Employees’ Retirement System, which includes both state and local government employees, provided an average annual benefit of $22,486 among all state retirees and $32,495 for new state retirees. Our ruling In a speech Monday on the Senate floor, Turner said: "The judicial system is the most underfunded in this state, able to only pay 52 percent of its obligations. Meanwhile, judges get some of the richest pensions of all public employees." The senator’s claim is on target. The Judicial Retirement System has about 52 percent of the funds needed to meet future pension obligations, marking the lowest amount of the five major pension funds. Retired judges also receive the largest annual pensions of the five funds with certain average benefits exceeding $100,000. We rate the statement True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-12155	Says his time away from Washington coincides with a "long planned renovation" for the White House.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/aug/08/donald-trump/renovations-Trump-out-White-House/	President Donald Trump partly blamed White House renovations for his Bedminster golf course retreat in a tweet on Aug. 7, 2017. "Working hard from New Jersey while White House goes through long planned renovation. Going to New York next week for more meetings." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We’ve already rated Trump’s promise to not take vacations as Stalled, but we wondered about the scope and timeline of the renovations keeping him away from the Oval Office. It turns out they were indeed long in the planning. The West Wing’s 27-year-old heating, ventilation and air conditioning system is being re-upped because thanks to constant use, deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters said, the system is well past its life cycle. "The West Wing will be without air conditioning for the next two weeks, which is why the staff and the president are moving out, because I don’t think any of you would like to be in the West Wing in an August D.C. summer day when it’s over 100 degrees with no air conditioning," Walters said. The General Service Administration assessed and priced at $1.97 million the installation of a new system in the West Wing in 2014, but only presented a plan to change it in the fall of 2016. The Obama administration approved the project but left its realization to the next president. The Trump administration will take advantage of the time for the air conditioning repair to also switch out the carpeting and paint the walls. Those cosmetic changes, Perry said, are commonplace for an incoming first family. These renovations typically occur closer to Inauguration Day, but the Trump administration deferred them until August. Carpet replacement will cost $1.17 million and a fresh coat of paint $275,000. Betty Monkman, who served as White House curator from 1967 to 2002, told us that August is a great time for refurbishments as the president and his family are away, staffers take vacation, and Congress isn’t in session. The staffers who are still working in the West Wing were relocated to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, an unusual move for annual refurbishments. "I don’t remember the staff being moved to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, but this affects the whole building," Monkman said. "The West Wing is small for all the staff that uses those spaces and it’s constantly being updated, so things change to accommodate that." The last time the HVAC unit was changed in the residence (which is separate from the West Wing) was in 1994, Monkman recalled. The renovation was still in the works when President Bill Clinton and his family returned from Martha’s Vineyard, so they stayed across the street at the Blair House, the president’s guest house. The Trumans also stayed at the Blair House when they gutted and rebuilt the White House. In addition to these changes, the White House is also renovating the Navy Mess kitchen, the West Wing lower lobby, the IT system and the South Portico steps. And following a week of flash floods in Washington (as well as frequent discussion of leaks to the press), they’re addressing ceiling leaks in the Lower Press area. Our rating Trump said the White House was going "through long planned renovation." The HVAC system upheaval keeping him and his staff out of the West Wing has been in the planning since 2014, while other typical White House refurbishments like carpet replacement and repainting have been put off since the inauguration. Presidents typically take an August recess and relocate to Blair House if more time is necessary, so we see nothing out of the ordinary in Trump’s tweet. We rate this statement True.

pomt-01456	Data on violent crime shows Wisconsin "has become less safe than it was when Scott Walker took office."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/02/wisconsin-professional-police-association/violent-crime-wisconsin-higher-under-scott-walker-/	The state’s largest police union explained its endorsement of Mary Burke for governor by saying Wisconsin has become more dangerous. "Under Scott Walker, not only has Wisconsin trailed its neighbors in creating jobs but in combating violent crime as well," Jim Palmer, the Wisconsin Professional Police Association's executive director, told reporters on Sept. 25, 2014. "The crime data shows that Wisconsin has become less safe than it was when Scott Walker took office." Unlike many statistics-driven claims we have seen, the union did not offer a specific number for a narrow period. Rather, it cited the more general "less safe" and pointed to the nearly four years since Walker took office. It also added an element of blame -- that any increase in violent crime is at least partly Walker’s fault. Many factors -- demographics, rates of incarceration, even police misreporting offenses -- can contribute to fluctuations in the incidence of crime, which is typically viewed more as a local issue than a statewide one. Still, the governor does have some say in how much money local governments have to spend. So let’s investigate. Violent crime data Palmer referred us to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports. Four offenses are counted as violent crimes: murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault. One problem: The most recent year available is 2012, so the numbers only cover about half of Walker's time as governor. We found that Wisconsin’s violent crime rate declined each year from 2007 through 2011, Walker’s first year in office, but increased in 2012. Year Wisconsin population Number of violent crimes Violent crimes/ 100,000 people One-year change in rate 2011 5,711,76 13,532 236.9 -4.7% 2012 5,726,398 16,064 280.5 +18.4% Nationally, violent crime also declined each year 2007 through 2011. But, in contrast to Wisconsin, the national rate declined again in 2012, to 386.9 violent crimes per 100,000 residents. In any case, it’s important to note that based on available statistics, the union's claim can't account for nearly the entire second half of Walker’s term. That is a significant unknown. Walker’s role As for pinning an increase in Wisconsin’s violent crime rate on Walker, local police and sheriff’s departments -- not the State Patrol or Capitol Police -- are most responsible for fighting crime. At the same time, cities, villages, towns and counties get a big chunk of their revenue from the state. And Walker also put strict limits on how much local governments could raise property taxes. Palmer pointed us to Walker’s first state budget, for 2011-’13 -- which reduced "shared revenue" to local governments. He also cited a related fact-check we did during the failed campaign to recall Walker in 2012. In that item, we found that Walker cut shared revenue by $76 million, or 9 percent -- the largest reduction in at least a decade. But two other points from that fact-check are also important: Shared revenue is general aid from the state that local governments use for various programs, not just police and fire. The state money is typically mixed with local money and isn’t tied to a specific local government function. Walker’s Act 10 collective bargaining reform law helped many local governments absorb at least some of the shared revenue cuts by forcing most public employees (though not police and firefighters) to pay more for their health and pension benefits. As for the size of law enforcement agencies, Palmer cited state Office of Justice Assistance statistics covering the more than 12,000 sworn officers in local police and sheriff’s departments, as well in the State Patrol, universities and the state Department of Natural Resources. The number of sworn officers per 1,000 residents declined by 2 percent in 2011 and 1.8 percent in 2012. But local governments, not the governor, ultimately make decisions that determine the lion’s share of front-line law enforcement officers around the state. Our rating The Wisconsin Professional Police Association union said: Data on violent crime shows Wisconsin "has become less safe than it was when Scott Walker took office." In 2012, Walker’s second year in office, violent crime increased and he reduced funding to local governments. But the available violent crime data cover only about half of Walker’s time in office, so the union’s statement is based at best on a partial picture. Beyond that, a number of factors other than the governor bear on the rate of violent crime. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-06920	"The only growth sector that we’ve had in the last two years in America is government growth."	false	/texas/statements/2011/jul/22/kay-bailey-hutchison/sen-hutchison-says-government-only-growth-sector-n/	Questioned about how the United States should bring down its national debt, U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas said government spending cuts, not tax increases, are the best tool. "We think the government is spending too much," the Republican said during a June 29 interview on CNBC. "The only growth sector that we've had in the last two years in America is government growth. That's not the way to come out of this massive $14 trillion debt burden that most surely is going to affect the middle class, and so I think the answer is not to tax anyone further, but to cut government spending." We wondered if Hutchison's government growth statement was on the money. During the interview, Hutchison didn't specify what kind of growth she was talking about. Her office told us later that she was referring to employment. To support Hutchison’s statement, her office sent us a graph originally posted in February in a blog on the website of the conservative Heritage Foundation, which attributed the figures to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The bureau, which is the government’s official source for job numbers, breaks down data on total (nonfarm) employment in several ways, including into the broad categories of "private" and "government" jobs but also into more detailed private industry sectors such as manufacturing and health care. The graph compares employment trends in two categories — the hefty private sector and the much smaller federal government — over a three-year period, from January 2008 (the month after the latest recession began) to January 2011. According to the graph, the federal workforce, excluding postal and temporary census workers, grew 11.7 percent in those years while private-sector employment fell 6.6 percent. That seems to support Hutchison's statement. However, the graph's time period doesn't align perfectly with the two-year period mentioned by Hutchison. Also, it solely tracks a subset of federal government workers, a qualification Hutchison did not make in her statement. In the CNBC interview, Hutchison specified a time period of "the last two years." Yet the graph covers a three-year span that ended five months before the interview. Significantly, when assessing employment trends, altering a time frame — even slightly — can change the picture. That's so in this case with private-sector employment. Hutchison’s office correctly pointed out that the number of private-sector jobs is far lower (about 6 percent) than it was before the start of the recession in December 2007. Yet, figures show, there has been private-sector growth more recently. At the time of the senator's interview, the most recent monthly employment data available from BLS was for May 2011. We found that between May 2009 and May 2011, private-sector jobs increased by about half a million (from 108.4 million to 108.9 million). There also was growth over the two-year period from April 2009 (108.7 million) to April 2011 (108.8 million). Then again, the result flip-flops — showing private-sector job losses — if you start the two-year comparison with March, February or January of this year. What gives? The answer has to do with the long-term trend. Starting in February 2008, the number of private-sector jobs in the United States fell for 25 months. In March 2010, that figure began to inch up again. It wasn't until April 2011 that the figure surpassed its two-year-previous level. Looking at the last two years of data on the number of federal employees who do not work for the Census Bureau or the post office, as the graph specifies, supports Hutchison's claim that there was growth. According to BLS information, that category of workers increased between May 2009 (2.1 million) and May 2011 (2.2 million). James Sherk, a Heritage Foundation policy analyst, explained that it made sense to use federal employment data that excluded postal and temporary census workers in the graph because it was created to highlight the part of the federal work force that is under President Barack Obama's control. The census workers were short-term employees whose hiring did not represent a long-term trend, Sherk said. And changes in the level of postal employees are determined by the demand for the agency's services, he said. But in her CNBC statement, Hutchison didn't say non-postal, non-census federal workers, or even simply federal workers. She said government. BLS reports information on overall government employment as a combination of federal, state and local workers. (The latter two categories make up the vast majority of the total.) From May 2009 to May 2011, total government employment dropped from 22.6 million to 22.1 million. In a July 12 item, PolitiFact National found that declines in state and local workforces have driven the overall drop in government workers. Among factors noted: the end of federal stimulus aid to states, continuing weakness in the economy and shrinking state and local revenue. Another recent PolitiFact National item noted that between the official end of the recession in June 2009 and June 2011, private payrolls have increased by about 1 million workers while government payrolls have declined by about 490,000. That’s the opposite of Hutchison's claim. Hutchison spokeswoman Lisette Mondello told us that even though the senator did not specify "federal" in her CNBC statement about government growth, the senator was obviously referring to federal government job growth since at the time she was discussing federal spending. Final thoughts: We ran Hutchison’s statement by a couple of experts before we received backup information from the senator. Noting Hutchison’s use of the word "sector" in her CNBC statement, Cheryl Abbot, a BLS economist in Dallas, suggested we compare the data on overall government employment with how other industry groups performed, rather than simply looking at the private sector as a whole. Of eight BLS sector categories, we found five whose payrolls grew over the last two years: mining and logging, professional and business services, education and health services, leisure and hospitality, and "other," which includes laundry services and membership associations, among others. Abbot and economist Lisa Mataloni of the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis, each noted that Hutchison didn’t use the word "jobs" in her remarks on CNBC and suggested that the senator's statement could be interpreted as about something else altogether. Mataloni pointed us to a data source — "real gross value added by sector" — that essentially measures, in dollars, how much an industry or a sector contributes to gross domestic product, itself a measure of the country's output of goods and services. The change in GDP from quarter to quarter is how the government quantifies the growth of the economy. The most recent two years' worth of data, from the last quarter of 2008 to the last quarter of 2010, show the contributions of both the business and government sectors as increasing between those quarters. All told, we see no reason to penalize Hutchison for failing to say that job gains (and losses) were the basis of her growth claim or failing to specify that by "government," she meant "federal." But she relied on an outdated report speaking to a three-year, not two-year, period. Over the two-year period that she noted, the federal government was not the only growth sector. Private-sector employment also increased. We rate her statement False.	None	Kay Bailey Hutchison	None	None	None	2011-07-22T06:00:00	2011-06-29	['United_States']
pomt-05137	"70 percent of the people who voted" on June 5, 2012, "just didn’t feel comfortable with the recall of the governor," weakening any idea that Wisconsin is "fully behind this Walker agenda."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jun/22/peter-barca/barca-says-voters-arent-fully-behind-walker-70-per/	In the wake of the failed effort to unseat Gov. Scott Walker at mid-term, top Wisconsin Democrats insisted the June 5, 2012, election results were not an endorsement of the Republican governor’s political agenda. At the party’s convention, Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca, D-Kenosha, put it this way: "The GOP is engaging in pure folly if they misread this election to think that the electorate of Wisconsin is fully behind this Walker agenda," Barca said. "Because 70 percent of the people who voted just didn’t feel comfortable with the recall of the governor." He added: "After all, Wisconsinites are sort of forgiving people and fair minded people. And I guess they felt when Gov. Walker said, if they gave him another chance he’d do things differently, that he’d build a consensus and work for bipartisanship." Before the recall rancor recedes into history, let’s look at how voters viewed the recall and what it says about support for Walker’s policies. To recall or not to recall Wisconsinites’ qualms about recalls were evident early on. In a January 2012 poll Marquette University Law School, more than 40 percent said recalls should only be allowed in cases of criminal wrongdoing by an officeholder. By June, after the recall, another MU poll found 50 percent support for that. On election day, widely cited exit poll results by Edison Research addressed head-on the question of the legitimacy of the recall. The firm asked 1,224 voters statewide when recalls are appropriate. --10 percent said recalls never should happen. --60 percent said recalls should only occur for official misconduct. --27 percent said they should happen "for any reason." Those results show a large majority who felt the recall was inappropriate to the circumstances, at least if you read "official misconduct" as some kind of civil or criminal charges by the person being recalled Barca added the first two results and got the 70 percent figure he cited in his remarks, Eric Greenfield, a Barca legislative office spokesman, told us. So, the numbers add up. But is it a fair reading of the exit polls that 70 percent "didn’t feel comfortable" with the recall? Charles Franklin, a political scientist who directs the Marquette poll, told us Barca’s comment stands up based on the exit polls. Since Walker has not been charged with official misconduct, it’s reasonable to lump the 60 percent in with the 10 percent "never" group as people who were not comfortable with the circumstances under which this recall was held, Franklin said. David Wegge, executive director of the Strategic Research Institute at St. Norbert College, agreed. "Not comfortable" may actually understate the intensity of the anti-recall feeling, Wegge said. The institute polls regularly on politics and other state issues. The Walker agenda But there’s another aspect to Barca’s remarks. He cited the 70 percent to bolster the notion that support for Walker’s agenda is softer than it may appear from the 53 percent majority Walker rang up compared to 46 percent for Barrett. Franklin and Wegge both said it’s really hard -- if not impossible -- to prove that from the available exit polling data. Indeed, it’s clear from the exit polls both Walker and Barrett got a large number of votes from people who seemed to think the recall was inappropriate. Nearly 95 percent of Walker supporters said recalls should never occur or only be for official misconduct. For Barrett, 42 percent of his backers felt that way. But that doesn’t tell us how many of the recall skeptics disagreed with Walker’s policies but voted for him anyway to somehow make a statement that the recall itself was inappropriate. There is one hint in the exits -- from a question on whether voters approved of Walker’s limits on collective bargaining by public employees. Ten percent of those who disagreed with Walker on that issue nevertheless voted for Walker. And there was an equal, opposite effect: 10 percent of those who approved of the union limits nonetheless voted for Barrett. (Overall on that question, the result closely mirrored the election: 52 percent approved and 47 percent disapproved.) Our rating Barca asserted that "70 percent of the people who voted just didn’t feel comfortable with the recall of the governor" weakening the notion Wisconsin is "fully behind" Walker’s policy agenda. Barca reasonable constructs the figure from a widely cited exit poll. Given the negative attitudes toward the recall election, he’s on safe ground. But there’s not enough information to judge the piece of Barca’s statement about the meaning of the anti-recall sentiments. And the exit poll question that comes closest provides murky results at best. We rate his claim Half True.	None	Peter Barca	None	None	None	2012-06-22T09:00:00	2012-06-08	['Wisconsin']
pomt-13455	"My opponent has no child care plan."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/14/donald-trump/trump-claim-Hillary-Clinton-has-no-child-ca/	In a Sept. 13 campaign event in Aston, Pa., Donald Trump unveiled a new, multi-pronged child care agenda. Trump’s plan would exclude child care costs up to age 13 from the federal income tax, including costs for both stay-at-home family members and paid caregivers. Those who don’t pay income taxes would be eligible to wipe out 50 percent of one parent’s payroll taxes through the earned income tax credit. Trump would also allow dependent-care savings accounts with a 50 percent government match on some contributions, as well as six weeks of paid leave for new mothers. But Trump didn’t stop with his policy offering. Trump accused Clinton -- who started her career at the Children’s Defense Fund and who’s considered child care a signature issue of her political career -- of not having any proposals for parents worried about their child care challenges. "While critical, meaningful policy work has been done in this area, my opponent has no child care plan," Trump said. "She never will. They'll never evolve into a plan. They'll never get done anyway." Trump wasn’t the only member of his campaign to make this point. His daughter Ivanka -- who became the first person involved in the campaign to publicly focus on child care policy when she gave an address at the Republican National Convention -- echoed that point in an interview with Fox News’ Megyn Kelly. "There’s no policy on Hillary Clinton’s website pertaining to any of these issues -- child care, elder care, or maternity leave or paternity leave, for that matter," Ivanka Trump said. Ivanka Trump was incorrect about elder care policy not being on Clinton’s website (it’s here) and also wrong about parental leave being absent (it’s here). But since the candidate himself specifically mentioned "child care," we’ll focus on that in this fact-check. Fairly quickly, we found two headings on the issues page of Clinton’s website that seemed to address the question -- one labeled paid family and medical leave and the other titled early childhood education. When we asked the Trump campaign to reconcile these headings with his comment, they responded that those two topics are separate and distinct from "child care." The campaign argued that "child care" refers to ages 0 to 4 -- before "early childhood education" begins at age 4 with preschool. The campaign also said that paid maternity leave is a policy area that’s separate from child care policy. Alan Viard, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who was cited favorably in Trump’s policy proposal, said he has "never before heard of ‘child care’ being defined as limited to ages 0 to 4." He added that the Trump campaign’s decision to include children up to age 13 suggests that "the campaign does not itself define child care in that odd manner." Still, let’s set aside whether the Trump campaign’s definitions are widely accepted. Instead, let’s use the campaign’s definition to see whether Clinton really has no policies relating to child care for those age 0 to 4. As long as you look deeper than the section headings on her website, Clinton does have policies addressing that age range. Specifically, she says: • "No family in America (should have to) pay more than 10 percent of its income to afford high-quality child care," a goal to be accomplished by "by significantly increasing the federal government’s investment in child care subsidies and providing tax relief for the cost of child care to working families." • "Double our investment in Early Head Start and the Early Head Start–Child Care Partnership program." (Early Head Start serves infants, toddlers, and pregnant women.) • "Award scholarships of up to $1,500 per year to help as many as 1 million student parents afford high-quality child care." • "Hillary will work to dramatically increase access to child care on campus by increasing funding for campus-based child care centers." So there are policies on Clinton’s website that address child care for ages 0 to 4. The Trump campaign didn’t respond after we forwarded them these examples. Viard agreed that the Clinton campaign "clearly has proposals for many aspects of child care, as commonly defined, and even under the odd 0 to 4 definition. Her 10 percent plan would apply to children in that age range, as well as to older children, and Early Head Start is targeted to children under the age of 3." Our ruling Trump said that "my opponent has no child care plan." Even under the campaign’s unusual, age-related definition of policies for children aged 0 to 4, Clinton has several policies to offer on her website. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-01089	Says Mitch McConnell credits Republicans "for recent economic improvements" even though they took control of the Senate only "days ago."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jan/14/gwen-moore/us-rep-gwen-moore-ridicules-mitch-mcconnell-credit/	On Jan. 9, 2015, two days after a new Congress was sworn in, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore tweaked new Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell with this tweet: "McConnell credits @GOP for recent econ improvements despite just gaining Senate control days ago. #RevisionistHistory" Sounds pretty silly. An economic recovery occurring just because Republicans took over the Senate days earlier? So, did the Kentucky Republican really say what the Milwaukee Democrat said he did? Just about. McConnell’s claim Moore reacted to comments McConnell made two days earlier on the Senate floor, after he took over as majority leader: "After so many years of sluggish growth, we’re finally starting to see some economic data that can provide a glimmer of hope. The uptick appears to coincide with the biggest political change of the Obama administration’s long tenure in Washington: the expectation of a new Republican Congress." So, McConnell was saying a recent economic uptick appears to "coincide" with "the expectation of a new Republican Congress." PolitiFact National rated that McConnell claim False, even leaving aside the question of whether McConnell was crediting the GOP for the uptick. Key statistics show the recovery was under way well before September 2014. That’s when a consensus emerged expecting that Republicans would win enough seats in the November 2014 elections to win a majority in the Senate. Moore’s claim Moore’s characterization of McConnell’s remark went a bit further. She said McConnell was crediting the GOP for a recovery because it had taken control of the Senate "days ago." But that expectation would have been in place a couple of months earlier, following the elections -- or perhaps a couple of months before that, as it became clear the GOP would win back the Senate. Our rating Moore said McConnell credits Republicans "for recent economic improvements" even though they took control of the Senate only "days ago." McConnell did say the recovery coincided with the expectation of the GOP taking over the Senate. But that expectation was months earlier, not days. We rate Moore’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-10069	On whether to seat Roland Burris as the new senator from Illinois.	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jan/18/harry-reid/democratic-shift-roland-burris/	"This is not about Mr. (Roland) Burris; it is about the integrity of a governor accused of attempting to sell this United States Senate seat. Under these circumstances, anyone appointed by Gov. (Rod) Blagojevich cannot be an effective representative of the people of Illinois and, as we have said, will not be seated." — Statement from U.S. Senate Democratic Caucus headed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Dec. 30, 2008 " We have spoken to Mr. Burris to let him know that he is now the senator-designate from Illinois and as such, will be accorded all the rights and privileges of a senator-elect. “We congratulate Senator-designee Burris on his appointment, and we look forward to working with him in the 111th Congress.” — Statement from Reid and Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, Jan. 13, 2009 So how did embattled Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich’s pick to fill Barack Obama’s vacated Senate seat go from — in Reid’s words — a “tainted appointment” to one welcomed to the Senate as a “colleague and a friend"? Suffice to say some things changed in the two weeks between these statements. The first statement came as Blagojevich defiantly appointed Burris, despite charges that the governor had attempted to trade the appointment for personal gain. Although there was no suggestion that Burris was ever involved in Blagojevich’s scheme, Senate Democratic leaders headed by Reid considered any appointment from Blagojevich “tainted” and vowed to block it. Reid explained the Senate Democrats’ initial hard line in a news conference on Jan. 7. “The reason Barack Obama joined with us in the first letter and certainly the statements made subsequent to that, that this nomination is tainted, because if you know anything about this, it doesn’t look very good. “Blagojevich, who was arrested at his home, going to work one morning, for trying to sell the office. We’ve seen, time and time again, in print and before the electronic media, the crude language of Blagojevich, saying this is an ‘effin gold mine, I’ve got to get anything I can out of it.’ “How are we supposed to react? We reacted in a very reasonable way.” But cracks in Reid’s seemingly entrenched stance began to appear just days after the first statement. In a Meet the Press interview on Jan. 4, host David Gregory asked if there weren’t “room here to negotiate and actually seat Burris.” Reid responded, “I’m an old trial lawyer. There’s always room to negotiate.” Legally, a few things fell Burris’ way. For one, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that the appointment was valid. Another hurdle was cleared when Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White wrote a letter validating the appointment. Senate Democratic leaders had initially pinned some of their legal opposition to the Burris appointment on the fact that White had not signed off on the appointment. In addition, Burris appeared before the Illinois House Committee on Impeachment and testified that he had never offered Blogojevich anything in return for his appointment. Senate Democratic leaders also found themselves facing mounting pressure from other Democrats, particularly the Congressional Black Caucus, to seat Burris. Senate Democratic leadership relented and eventually backed Burris. He was sworn in on Jan. 15, and, like Obama was, will be the only African-American serving in the U.S. Senate. “There are many paths to the United States Senate,” Reid said from the floor on Jan. 15. “It is fair to say that the path that brought our new colleague from Illinois to us was unique. "Senator Burris, on behalf of all senators, we welcome you as a colleague and a friend." Whether political pressure, a realization of legal inevitability or the change in Burris' credentials was the tipping point, the fact is that Reid and other Senate Democratic leaders drew a line in the sand and then, two weeks later, did an about-face. Think of it this way: Who wants to bet Republicans won’t use video clips of Reid’s earlier statements when the Burris seat comes up for election in 2010? We call Reid’s position a Full Flop.

pomt-11992	North Korea is "the fifth or fourth most sanctioned nation."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/27/cory-gardner/north-korea-4th-most-sanctioned-nation/	Amid a war of words between the United States and North Korea, Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., took to the Sunday shows to argue Washington should apply more pressure to Pyongyang. While the United States has recently dialed up sanctions against Kim Jong Un’s regime, Gardner argued they could go further. "(North Korea) is now the fifth or fourth most sanctioned nation," Gardner said, "meaning that we have a long ways to go to continue to ratchet up the economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea and the enablers of North Korea." We decided to investigate how sanctions against North Korea compare with those targeting other countries. Rankings based on Office of Foreign Assets Control list An aide to Gardner pointed us to a chart from a recent paper by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. That paper, which was presented before Congress, ranks North Korea as the fourth most sanctioned country, behind Ukraine/Russia, Syria and Iran, respectively. Rankings were derived by comparing countries according to the number of sanctioned people and entities tracked by the Treasury Department. That sanctions list is officially known as the Office of Foreign Assets Control Specially Designated Nationals list, or OFAC list. It’s important to note that the data in the chart below was current as of Aug. 29, 2017, so it doesn’t include more recent sanctions. Gardner cited the above data not only to drive home his point that North Korea could be more heavily sanctioned, but also to show the impact of legislation he backed, the North Korea Policy Sanctions Enhancement Act, which took effect Feb. 18, 2016. "Last year, when Congress passed my legislation, North Korea was the eighth most sanctioned nation on Earth," Gardner said. "As a result of that legislation, it's now the fifth or fourth most sanctioned nation, meaning that we have a long ways to go to continue to ratchet up the economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea and the enablers of North Korea." (Note: We’re interested here in U.S. sanctions, not sanctions imposed by other countries.) We asked the Treasury Department whether the rankings were accurate but did not receive a reply by publication time. The limits of the OFAC list-as-ranking Even if you assume the raw numbers are correct, several experts we spoke to thought this approach to country rankings was problematic—though some allowed that a more far-reaching measurement would be tough to calculate. Experts’ main objection was that ranking countries based solely on the quantity of sanctions wouldn’t necessarily capture the quality, or impact, of sanctions. "Gauging how tough sanctions are is not simply a count of measures taken, but what share of economic activity they are covering, how willing other states are to implement them, and the related ability of the country to circumvent them through evasion," said Stephan Haggard, a professor of Korea-Pacific Studies at the University of California-San Diego. Joseph deThomas, professor of international affairs at Penn State University, said that while there is "no perfect method" for setting up a ranking system of this kind, basing it on the quantity of sanctions alone misses the mark. He suggested taking into account "the amount of financial, economic or national security pain inflicted on the sanctioned country." "Is a country with a lot of people banned from getting visas more sanctioned than one that has one sanction on its Central Bank that denies it access to the dollar?" DeThomas said. "Not likely." We reached out to Anthony Ruggiero, who authored the Foundation for Defense of Democracies paper, who argued the quantitative approach illuminates several key points about North Korea, relative to other sanctioned countries. He also emphasized the importance of reading the qualitative discussion of North Korean sanctions elsewhere in the paper. "This approach verifies North Korea is not the most sanctioned county in the world, and provides a pathway toward further invest of additional sanctions against North Korea and its facilitators," he said. Some experts acknowledged the difficulty of carrying out a more holistic approach. "As you can imagine, such a modeling exercise is really, really hard, and a count of measures is not going to do the work," Haggard said. Marcus Noland of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said there are better ways of assessing sanctions impact, "but they require actual time, effort, and modeling, and honestly there isn’t much of a market for comparative sanctions analysis." Our ruling Gardner said, "(North Korea) is now the fifth or fourth most sanctioned nation." A paper by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies ranks North Korea as the fourth most sanctioned country, behind Ukraine/Russia, Syria and Iran, respectively. According to the paper’s author, rankings were based on the Treasury Department’s list of sanctioned people and entities. The Treasury Department did not confirm the rankings. However, experts we spoke to said ranking countries based solely on its number of sanctions was problematic because numbers alone wouldn’t necessarily capture the total impact of sanctions.

pomt-08401	"Rick Perry has become a millionaire on the public payroll."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/oct/22/bill-white/bill-white-says-gov-rick-perry-became-millionaire-/	This year's Democratic gubernatorial nominee, whose campaign is called "Bill White for Texas," has latched onto the idea that GOP Gov. Rick Perry is for ... Rick Perry. "Rick Perry has become a millionaire on the public payroll," the narrator says in a TV ad that was posted on YouTube Oct. 4. "He's a career politician who's taken a government check for 25 years, and today, he's a millionaire." The words "Murky land deal mark Gov. Rick Perry's past" and "Gov. Perry wealth fueled by land deals" appear on the screen. It's not novel for White to niggle Perry about his wealth; he earlier zeroed in on the governor living in a posh rental home while the Governor's Mansion is repaired. But we haven't yet explored White's claim that Perry's gotten rich while a state official. Some background: White is correct that Perry has been in elected office 25 years. He was elected as a Democrat to the Texas House in 1984 and after switching parties was elected state agriculture commissioner in 1990 and then lieutenant governor in 1998. He succeeded Gov. George W. Bush, who was elected president, in late 2000 and was elected twice to that office in his own right. As of January 2010, Perry had been in one state office or another for more than 25 years. He's seeking his third full term as governor. While working for the state, Perry's pay has increased from $7,200 a year while serving as a legislator to $150,000 annually, according to a September 2009 story in the Associated Press. According to Perry's 2009 income tax return, he and Anita reported an adjusted gross income of $200,370. But income doesn't factor into this millionaire equation. White's campaign told us it gauges Perry's 'millionaire' status based on his net worth — his assets minus his liabilities. Not that there's anything wrong with personal wealth, White would likely say. As of April 30, the market value of White's liquid net worth — cash, publicly-traded stocks and mutual funds — was approximately $2.7 million, according to a comparison by the White campaign of White's and Perry's publicly disclosed financial information. Additional assets include IRA accounts with about $2 million invested in common stocks and mutual funds. In 2009, White, and his wife Andrea, reported $659,762 in adjusted gross income, according to their income tax return for that year. To back up White's claim about Perry becoming a millionaire while working for taxpayers, White spokeswoman Katy Bacon pointed us to a Sept. 26, 2009 AP news story cited in the ad. "Gov. Rick Perry never had much money growing up," the story says, "and he has spent most of his adult life in public office, drawing a part-time salary as a legislator and relatively modest earnings in statewide office for the last quarter century. But thanks to his investments and a series of private land deals, some that took advantage of his political connections, Perry has squeaked over the millionaire line." According to Perry's 1984 financial statement, he had at least $28,000 in assets and at least $15,000 in liabilities — a net worth of $13,000. According to the AP, which analyzed 18 years worth of Perry's public financial records with the help of Houston accountant Bob Martin, some real estate investments were extremely rewarding for Perry. Most recently, in 2007, Perry sold lakefront Horseshoe Bay property he'd acquired in 2001 for $1.4 million, making a profit of $823,766. In their federal tax filing covering 2007, Perry and his wife, Anita, reported $1.09 million in adjusted gross income. The year before, they reported $204,065 in adjusted gross income. Martin told us that the money Perry has made on real estate transactions alone most likely propelled his net worth past $1 million. According to the AP, the blind trust has produced at least $600,000 in income since 1997. Perry's income tax returns also show that the trust posted a loss of about $567,000 in 2008, according to a Sept. 2 story in the Austin American-Statesman. Martin told us that loss probably resulted from Perry bailing out of the stock market when the economy soured. But it's difficult to know precisely how much Perry is worth because he, like some other elected officials, keeps his financial holdings in a blind trust he established in 1996. Under a 2003 state law, officeholders are not supposed to know what the trust holds or what assets are acquired or disposed of — those decisions are left to a trustee, whom the elected official selects. His 2009 financial statement only reveals that the blind trust is worth $25,000 or more — the highest value bracket on the form. Allison Castle, a spokeswoman in the governor's office, said that as of August 2009, Perry's blind trust was worth $896,000, according to several news stories. We sought up-to-date information from the governor on his assets and liabilities but didn't hear back. In analyzing Perry's income tax returns and financial statements, which list Perry's assets and liabilities that aren't in the blind trust in a value bracket, Martin told us that he used the lowest possible value of each asset, minus the lowest possible value of each liability. The net worth: about $1 million, including the value of the blind trust. According to Perry's 2009 financial statement, he earned at least $10,000 from an investment partnership he owns with his father, and the house the Perrys owned in College Station was appraised at $243,900 last year, according to the Brazos County Appraisal District. According to the county website, the house deed passed to new owners on Feb. 5, 2010. He earned at least $2,000 in rent from tenants living in his College Station house, and had at least $70,000 in liabilities, including a car loan for a Mercedes-Benz. Not disclosed: the value of his retirement fund, often a big component of one's asset mix. Perry hasn't released that figure but if he were to retire at the end of this term, he could receive as much as $86,250 per year in state retirement. Or, he could choose to receive a check for up to 36 months of his standard pension as a lump sum worth $258,750 before taxes. (His future pension payments would be permanently reduced after that.) Our calculation: In 2009, Perry's net worth was at least $1,081,900. Perry's assets totalled $1,151,900 (at least $10,000 from investments, $243,900 from his house, at least $2,000 in rent from tenants living in his College Station house and $896,000 from his blind trust, as of August 2009). His liabilities amounted to at least $70,000 in personal notes. Martin said that nothing in the Perrys' 2009 tax return suggests that his net worth dropped below $1 milllion, but the lack of public information about his blind trust makes it impossible to tell for sure. And that's the hitch in White's claim. Since Perry's financial holdings are not public, much is unknown. Still, available records lead us to conclude the governor was worth about $1 million in 2009. He was worth far less before he entered state office. We rate White's statement Mostly True.	None	Bill White	None	None	None	2010-10-22T06:00:00	2010-10-04	['None']
pomt-03587	Says Kelly Ayotte voted to "fix background checks."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/15/reclaim-america-pac/pac-ad-says-kelly-ayotte-voted-fix-background-chec/	New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte saw her poll numbers drop after she voted against a proposal to expand background checks on gun sales. Now coming to her rescue is Marco Rubio’s Reclaim America PAC. The Florida senator’s group is out with an ad that says Ayotte "voted to fix background checks." What gives? Did she vote against them or vote to fix them? The answer depends on how you define the fix. Gun control groups say background checks won’t be fixed unless they are expanded to cover more types of gun sales. The bill Ayotte voted for did not do that, but it would have added more records to the database used to run background checks in hopes of keeping guns from criminals and the mentally ill. Let's explore. Manchin-Toomey amendment The background check amendment, sponsored by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., was a compromise intended to replace stricter language in Majority Leader Harry Reid’s Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013. Current law requires checks on purchases only from federally licensed gun dealers. Reid’s bill would have expanded them to all transfers, even private ones among family members, with few exceptions. The Manchin-Toomey amendment attempted to find middle ground -- expanding the checks to gun shows and Internet sales, but not requiring them of family members and friends giving or selling guns to each other. Ayotte joined Republican colleagues in a mostly partisan vote, defeating the measure 54-46. (Procedurally, the amendment needed 60 votes to pass). Ayotte, in declaring opposition to the measure, said: "I believe that restricting the rights of law-abiding gun owners will not prevent a deranged individual or criminal from obtaining and misusing firearms to commit violence. While steps must be taken to improve the existing background check system, I will not support the Manchin-Toomey legislation, which I believe would place unnecessary burdens on law-abiding gun owners and allow for potential overreach by the federal government into private gun sales." The Republican alternative The same day as the vote on Manchin-Toomey, Republican Sens. Charles Grassley of Iowa and Ted Cruz of Texas introduced a substitute amendment. Like Manchin-Toomey, that amendment won a majority of votes (52-48), but not the needed 60. The Grassley amendment would have provided incentives for states to submit relevant mental health records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and required federal courts to do so. It also would have allocated money for prosecuting violations of the background check requirement. But it did not expand the requirement to cover any new firearms sales, such as at gun shows or over the Internet. (Editor's note: We looked more into the details of the Grassley amendment after we published this report. See our story for a more detailed discussion on the how the amendment would have worked.) Eight senators ended up voting in favor of both background check measures. In an op-ed several weeks after the votes, Ayotte said Manchin-Toomey would have expanded "the broken background check system we have now." "In my view, we shouldn’t be expanding a flawed system. The focus should be on fixing the existing system, which criminals are flouting. We need to make sure we are enforcing current law and prosecuting those who attempt to illegally obtain firearms," she wrote. "And we must ensure that NICS includes records currently not being entered in the system, including mental health adjudications where an individual is found to be a danger to themselves and others." Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a pro gun-control organization founded by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, said the amendment Ayotte supported did "nothing to close the gaping loophole that allows criminals to buy guns without background checks." Our ruling The PAC ad said Ayotte voted to "fix background checks." But we found differing opinions on what would actually fix the system. Reclaim America’s evidence is her support for a measure that would have put more records into the instant criminal check system, with the aim of capturing more people whose gun applications should be rejected. But to many in the gun-control debate, fixing background checks means requiring them on firearms bought at gun shows and over the Internet. The ad, as you might expect, only portrays one side of the background check debate. The other side could reasonably argue that Ayotte stood in the way of fixing the loopholes in background checks. On balance, we rate the statement Half True. Update: After this story was published, we looked into more details about the Grassley amendment and how it would have worked, specifically the incentives to states to send mental health records to the federal background check database. We published our additional findings in this story. The ruling on this fact-check remains the same.	None	Reclaim America PAC	None	None	None	2013-05-15T17:01:43	2013-05-14	['None']
pomt-11857	"With this plan, the typical family of four will save $1,182 a year on their taxes."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/03/paul-ryan/would-house-gop-tax-plan-save-typical-family-1182/	In unveiling the House Republicans’ tax bill, Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., touted its positive impact for a typical American family. "With this plan, the typical family of four will save $1,182 a year on their taxes," Ryan said Nov. 2. This amount is more than two-thirds lower than what the White House earlier said before the details of the House proposal were hammered out -- that "the average American family would get a $4,000 raise under the President’s tax cut plan." We have urged skepticism about the $4,000 figure. But what about the $1,182 figure? When we took a closer look at the math, we found that it leaves out some important qualifiers. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com How the House math figure works The House Ways and Means Committee calculated several scenarios for how the proposal’s changes could affect different types of taxpayers. The key elements in this calculation involve tax brackets, the standard deduction and the child tax credit. Currently, there are seven brackets; these would be consolidated into four -- 12 percent (up from 10 percent today), 25 percent, 35 percent, and 39.6 percent. In the meantime, the standard deduction will be raised from $12,000 to $24,000. And the child tax credit will be increased from $1,000 to $1,600, bolstered by a new $300 credit for parents and other dependents. The example Ryan highlighted refers to a "family of four making $59,000 per year." Here’s the scenario outlined in the House’s fact sheet, using the fictional example of "Steve and Melinda" with two middle school-aged children: "As a result of lower tax rates, a significantly larger standard deduction, and an enhanced Child Tax Credit and Family Flexibility Credit, Steve and Melinda will pay over $1,182 less in taxes than last year, reducing their total tax bill from $1,582 to only $400. "That’s more money they can use for whatever is important to them, whether it’s paying bills, purchasing a new refrigerator, or putting away savings for the future." The Ways and Means Committee, answering questions for Ryan’s office, said they chose a household income of $59,000 because it’s the median household income nationally. For that amount of income, a family today would get $12,700 from the standard deduction, $16,200 in personal exemptions, leaving $30,100 in taxable income. Of that, $18,650 would be taxed at 10 percent and $11,450 would be taxed at 15 percent, meaning the preliminary tax liability would be $3,582.50. That would be adjusted with $2,000 in child tax credits, producing a final tax liability of $1,582.50. Under the new tax bill, the family would take a larger $24,000 standard deduction (the proposal eliminates personal exemptions), leaving $35,000 in taxable income. At the 12 percent rate, that would mean $4,200 in preliminary liability. This would be offset by $3,200 in child tax credits and $600 in family credits, leaving a final tax liability of $400. That’s a $1,182.50 tax cut. So Ryan has some mathematical detail to back up the figure. But it leaves out at least three caveats. The median household income is $59,000, but the median family income is almost $73,000: The Ways and Means Committee used the figure for median household income, but Ryan referred to the "typical family of four." The major difference is that households can include one person living alone, whereas a family is a group of two or more people related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together. So among families, a $59,000 income is not necessarily "typical" -- it’s actually in the bottom half of the income spectrum. The last time the median family income was as low as $59,000 was in 1985. On the other hand, Ryan's office notes that if you calculate the impact the same way for a family that earns $73,000, the savings are actually higher, at $1,602. Your mileage may vary: The GOP bill eliminates or shrinks a number of widely used itemized deductions, and those factors aren’t taken into account in the figure Ryan cited. The deductions eliminated or pared back in the bill include the mortgage interest deduction (for future mortgages, it would be capped at half its previous maximum); the state and local tax deduction (only $10,000 in property tax deductions would be allowed); the medical expense deduction; the casualty loss deduction; and the student loan interest deduction. Exchanging these changes for a higher standard deduction may benefit many taxpayers, particularly those who choose not to itemize today. But some taxpayers who depend on these itemized deductions today may end up worse off if the bill is passed as is, even with the higher standard deduction. For this type of taxpayer, the loss of even one of those deductions could conceivably wipe out that $1,182 gain for certain types of families. This specific amount of tax savings is good for just the first year: The benefits for this family shrink, slowly but surely, over the next decade. "The tax cut definitely dissipates over time," David Kamin, a tax and budget specialist at the New York University law school, told PolitiFact. Kamin cited a combination of factors, including the sunsetting of the $300 per parent tax credit; the lack of inflation adjustments for the child tax credit, which effectively replace personal exemptions that were indexed to inflation; and the new use of an inflation adjustment measure known as chained CPI, which grows more slowly than the yardstick in current use. According to Kamin’s calculations, the initial tax cut for the family making $59,000 becomes a $500 tax increase by 2024 compared to the status quo. Here’s the graph he put together: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Ryan said, "With this plan, the typical family of four will save $1,182 a year on their taxes." This is based on a plausible and transparent calculation, but Ryan glosses over some context. The calculation doesn’t factor in several itemized deductions that would disappear under the proposal and that could have a significant impact on at least some "typical" families around that income level. And Ryan’s statement is misleading when he says the family will save "$1,182 a year," since that’s the case in the first year only; after that, the benefit starts to shrink and eventually turns into a tax hike. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-15256	Planned Parenthood is "the only health care that a significant number of women get. About 30 percent of women, that's their health care."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/31/harry-reid/harry-reid-says-30-women-rely-only-planned-parenth/	An anti-abortion group recently released several secretly recorded videos of Planned Parenthood employees discussing fetal tissue, and that has given opponents of the abortion-providing health organization new momentum to shut off federal funding. During Senate floor debate on July 29, 2015, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., urged lawmakers to focus on consequences for women who rely on Planned Parenthood for health care beyond abortions if the federal funding is cut off. Planned Parenthood "is the health care backbone for American women during their lives," Reid said. "In fact, it's the only health care that a significant number of women get. About 30 percent of women, that's their health care." A reader thought that number sounded high and asked us to check it out. We started by doing some basic math. According to the 2013 Census Bureau population estimate, there were about 161 million women in the United States, of whom 131 million were age 15 or over -- the primary constituency for Planned Parenthood. Thirty percent of that number is about 39 million women. Did Planned Parenthood serve 39 million women who had no other health care options? Not even close. According to the most recent Planned Parenthood annual report, the organization saw 2.7 million patients in 2013, completing 10.6 million separate procedures. The biggest categories of procedures were sexually transmitted infection tests (3.7 million), reversible contraception (2.1 million), emergency contraception kits (1.4 million), pregnancy tests (1.1 million), and HIV tests (704,000). (For the record, the group disclosed that it performed 327,653 abortions during that period, or about 3 percent of all procedures.) Equally problematic, there's no indication in Planned Parenthood’s data that each of the 2.7 million patients had no other health care resources to rely on, as Reid said was the case. When we checked with Reid’s office, a spokesman said that the senator was speaking off the cuff and had meant to refer to a different statistic. That is a statistic -- often cited by Planned Parenthood itself -- is that "one in five American women has chosen Planned Parenthood for health care at least once in her life." But that’s not what Reid said. Our ruling Reid said Planned Parenthood is "the only health care that a significant number of women get. About 30 percent of women, that's their health care." That’s not the case -- Planned Parenthood saw 2.7 million patients in 2013, not the 39 million it would have needed to see for Reid’s claim to be accurate. Even if every Planned Parenthood patient had no other health care options, the group would have seen about 2 percent of women, not 30 percent. His office acknowledged that Reid, making off-the-cuff remarks, got the talking point wrong. In this case, he really got it wrong. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-00957	The Department of Homeland Security is "the only federal department not funded for this entire fiscal year" by Congress.	true	/texas/statements/2015/feb/18/lloyd-doggett/lloyd-doggett-says-homeland-security-only-us-agenc/	In a commentary, U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Austin criticized border-security legislation advanced by a fellow U.S. House member at a time that funding for the Department of Homeland Security seems stand-alone shaky. Doggett, a Democrat, said the Border Security Results Act offered by Austin’s Michael McCaul, the Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, was premised on the unattainable goal of no unauthorized border crossers, making for a border tighter than that of North Korea. Moreover, Doggett wrote in his article posted online Jan. 26, 2015, by the Austin American-Statesman: "Our border security is being further undermined by Republican limitations on DHS law enforcement funding. This is the only federal department not funded for this entire fiscal year. Uncertain stop-and-start, short-term appropriations weaken the ability to plan at a time of heightened international security concerns." We think of Uncle Sam as gigantic, sprawling, multi-digited. Is Homeland Security all alone in going unfunded through the fiscal year running through September 2015? Doggett’s factual backup By email, Doggett spokeswoman Leslie Tisdale cited a Dec. 10, 2014, Congressional Quarterly news story referring to 11 spending measures that had made it through Congress with only a "continuing resolution" approved to maintain Homeland Security funding for a few months. And on Dec. 16, 2014, she noted, the White House announced President Barack Obama had signed into law the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2015, "which provides fiscal year 2015 full-year appropriations through September 30, 2015, for all agencies except the Department of Homeland Security, for which appropriations are provided instead through February 27, 2015." Congressional actions Then again, news accounts suggest there’s room for Homeland Security funding to be worked out. In early 2015, the Republican-majority House advanced a measure funding Homeland Security through the fiscal year. A Jan. 9, 2015, press release from the House Appropriations Committee said the fiscal 2015 Homeland Security funding measure, described as the "last of the 12 annual funding bills to be considered," included $39.7 billion in discretionary funding, an increase of $400 million compared with what lawmakers ponied up the previous year. Under the proposal, funding would flow to Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Transportation Security Administration, cybersecurity, the Coast Guard, the Secret Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the release said. But the appropriation had a catch. Five days later, the House voted mostly along party lines to tie the funding to reversing Obama’s immigration actions, though news accounts said it was unlikely sufficient senators would agree to the linkage and even if that improbably happened, Obama would veto the measure. "House approval of the spending bill was just the opening act in a debate expected to stretch into late February, when funding for the Department of Homeland Security is set to expire," the Washington Post reported. A Jan. 15, 2015, New York Times news story hinted the issue would be worked out. "Because Republicans have said that they will use the $40 billion funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security as their vehicle for dismantling" Obama’s immigration actions, the story said, "Congress faces another deadline that seems likely to force an accommodation before the department's money is due to run out at the end of February." "One disagreement Republicans will have to work out is how far they are willing to go to push legislation that has no chance of becoming law--because it dies either in the Senate or in a presidential veto," the Times story said. "It is clear that some House Republicans want--and expect--the Senate to be as unyielding as they have been, though that is not likely. Asked how far he was willing to go, Rep. Trent Franks of Arizona said, '’All the way to where we fail to override.’" "If the feud lingers beyond Feb. 27 with no compromise and Homeland Security funding runs out," the Times’ story said, "millions of federal employees within the department's vast bureaucracy will have to work without pay. Around 85 percent of the department is classified as ‘essential’ and must report to work regardless of whether their agency is effectively shut down. This includes Border Patrol agents and Transportation Security Administration screeners," the story said. We asked Homeland Security if more details had been revealed about what happens after Feb. 27 and didn’t draw any. Independent confirmation Separately, a budget expert told us Doggett got it right. By email to our inquiry, Jack Deutsch of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonprofit committed to educating the public about issues with significant fiscal policy impact, said that one of its policy advisers, Ed Lorenzen, noted that at the end of 2014, Congress passed legislation, referred to as the CRomnibus, providing funding for all federal agencies except Homeland Security for all of fiscal 2015 "but only continuing funding for the Homeland Security appropriations through Feb. 27." Our ruling Doggett said Homeland Security is "the only federal department not funded for the entire year" by Congress. That was so as of when Doggett spoke in January 2015. Congressional Republicans were attempting to tie funding through the fiscal year to a repeal of Obama’s 2014 announcement the administration intended to shield some unauthorized immigrants from deportation.

pomt-01320	"$2.4 million of the NIH dollars was spent on ‘origami’ condoms."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2014/oct/27/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-nih-spent-24-million-origami-condom/	During a recent visit to Virginia, U.S. Sen. Rand Paul took exception to claims that budget cuts have hurt the National Institute of Health’s efforts to find a cure for Ebola. The Kentucky Republican was the headliner at an Oct. 15 rally in Ashland for Dave Brat, the GOP nominee for the 7th District congressional seat. Paul, a Tea Party favorite, said NIH has money to waste. "Do you know what the NIH spends money on?" he asked the crowd. Paul listed a series of NIH projects he viewed as profligate. "$2.4 million of the NIH dollars was spent on ‘origami’ condoms," he said. "This is a family crowd, so I’m not getting into what that means." But we will. We wondered if his claim is correct. Origami is the Japanese art of folding paper to form animals, flowers and other designs, according to Webster’s New World College Dictionary. We struggled to imagine how this centuries-old craft might improve the condom. Paul’s office backed the senator’s statement by sending us several articles about NIH’s funding of condom research, the earliest one published by the Washington Free Beacon this March. Turns out, there’s a California company, named ORIGAMI, that’s vowing to reinvent the condom, a contraceptive that many men don’t like. The company believes the popularity of condoms -- which must be unrolled and are typically made of latex -- would greatly improve if they were more pleasing, less cumbersome and safer to use. ORIGAMI is developing condom with accordion-like pleats. They’re made of silicone and, because they’re loose-fitting and don’t have to be unrolled, can be put on faster than traditional condoms. The company is seeking FDA approval and hopes sell its product next year. A number of global health organizations are encouraging condom research and development, convinced that greater use of devices will lead to fewer unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases such as AIDs. Since 2006, NIH has awarded seven grants totaling almost $2.5 million to help develop male and female ORIGAMI condoms. The money was provided to Strata Various, a product design firm headed by Danny Resnic, ORIGAMI’s founder. Resnic is listed on the grant documents as the project leader of the research. ORIGAMI’s work has been praised by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which last year handed out $1.1 million in grants other entrepreneurs seeking to improve condoms. The Foundation said ORIGAMI "provides an excellent example of a private enterprise focused on new condom design to promote consistent use by emphasizing the sexual experience." Now, let’s return to Paul’s speech. The senator, in lamenting the use of public funds to develop "origami’ condoms," never defined the difference between the folded paper art and the name of a company. We asked Brian Darling, a spokesman for Paul, whether his boss was referring to Origami with a capital "O," meaning the company, or a small "o," meaning the art form. "The senator’s words speak for themselves," Darling replied in an email. "I don’t understand the confusion." The day before he appeared in Ashland, Paul spelled origami with a small "o" in Facebook post and a tweet assailing NIH’s spending. "NIH blames tightening federal budget for its inability to produce #Ebolavaccine, but somehow found $2.4 million to develop 'origami' condoms designed with Japanese folding paper in mind," Paul wrote on his Facebook page. He tweeted, "@NIH cant afford #Ebola vaccine bc of 'budget cuts' but can spend $2.4 mill to develop 'origami' condoms #Priorities http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-" So what does the company have to say about all this? Mark Bardwell, an ORIGAMI spokesman, defended the grants, saying they are given out "based on scientific merit." "Condoms are considered a medical device. As such, it must pass FDA safety testing standards through clinical trials that are very expensive," Bardwell said. "An innovation condom could take 3-4 years and several million dollars for R&D and human testing." Our ruling In trying to document waste at NIH, Paul said the health agency spent $2.4 million on "origami" condoms. Paul didn’t provide any more information in his speech, leaving the crowd to wonder whether tax dollars are going to the development of paper condoms folded into fancy shapes. What he didn’t say is that ORIGAMI is the name of a company that has received the NIH grants to develop an improved condom that is made of silicone and has fold-out pleats. NIH has long encouraged condom use to reduce unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. We don’t find much fault with Paul, however. The company, by its very name, suggests the principles of origami drive its design. So we rate Paul’s claim Mostly True.	None	Rand Paul	None	None	None	2014-10-27T06:00:00	2014-10-15	['None']
pomt-07973	"Ben Franklin once quipped that only two things in life were certain: death and taxes. I think even he didn't envision that the tax man would visit on the day of your death."	false	/ohio/statements/2011/jan/21/jay-hottinger/rep-jay-hottingers-assessment-founding-father-unfo/	None of the Founding Fathers is more quotable than Benjamin Franklin. Arguably the greatest mind of the founding generation, he was a printer, journalist, scientist, inventor, financial thinker, statesman, diplomat and musician -- among other things. His range of interests and prolific writing over his 84 years produced a shelf of memorable maxims, thoughts and observations. One of the most famous was quoted in the Ohio House of Representatives when Republicans introduced a plan to repeal the state's estate tax. "Ben Franklin once quipped that only two things in life were certain: death and taxes," said Rep. Jay Hottinger, a Republican from Newark. "I think even he didn't envision that the tax man would visit on the day of your death -- and that's something that needs to end here in the state of Ohio." PolitiFact Ohio was intrigued, mostly because we wondered if there really was anything that Franklin could not envision. So in a week where we marked the 305th anniversary of Franklin’s birth (Jan. 17, 1706), we looked to see what history might reveal. Ohio wasn’t yet a state during Franklin’s lifetime. The federal estate tax wasn’t enacted until 1916, during the Progressive Era, partly as a way to break up large accumulations of wealth. Inheritance taxes, levied on those who receive property from an estate, were imposed as an emergency revenue measure three times before that. The first was in 1797, the same year that Thomas Paine’s essay "Agrarian Justice" was published. In the essay, Franklin's friend and protege proposed creating a sort of national social security fund, financed by a 10 percent tax on inherited property. Franklin died in 1790, but "Agrarian Justice" does contain echoes of his writing. In a letter to Robert Morris in 1783, Franklin wrote about the right of the public to regulate property passing to heirs: "All Property, indeed, except the Savage's temporary Cabin, his Bow, his Matchcoat, and other little Acquisitions, absolutely necessary for his Subsistence, seems to me to be the Creature of public Convention. Hence the Public has the Right of Regulating Descents, and all other Conveyances of Property, and even of limiting the Quantity and the Uses of it." Basic property necessary for man to live should be left alone, Franklin wrote. But he continued that "all Property superfluous to such purposes is the Property of the Publick, who, by their Laws, have created it, and who may therefore by other Laws dispose of it, whenever the Welfare of the Publick shall demand such Disposition." We thought one sentence has particular relevant here: "Hence the Public has the Right of Regulating Descents, and all other Conveyances of Property, and even of limiting the Quantity and the Uses of it." In the book "Wealth and Our Commonwealth," William H. Gates Sr. and Chuck Collins write: "The nation’s founders and populace viewed excessive concentrations of wealth as incompatible with the ideals of the new nation. Revolutionary era visitors to Europe, including Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine, John Adams, and Ben Franklin, were aghast at the wide disparities of wealth and poverty they observed. They surmised that these great European inequalities were the result of an aristocratic system of land transfers, hereditary political power, and monopoly." If you Google "death and taxes," you'll find Franklin's quote cited frequently in arguments against the estate tax, often called the "death tax" by opponents. Franklin, 83 and ailing, made the quip to friend Jean Baptiste Le Roy, a French physicist, in one of the letters whose tone Isaacson calls "inappropriately lighthearted." Franklin wrote: "Our new Constitution is now established, and has an appearance that promises permanency; but in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes." We sought further guidance from Franklin authority Dr. Michael Zuckerman, professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania, which Franklin founded. There is "nothing whatever in that quote pertinent to estate taxes," he responded. But Franklin, he told us, did not view taxes negatively. Rather, Zuckerman said, he was "mistrustful of great wealth, and quite supportive of inheritance taxes." Even today, the "tax man" does not literally "visit on the day of your death," and we take Rep. Hottinger's quip as a figurative expression for the reality of a tax being imposed on the deceased person's estate. And that, he said, was something Franklin likely couldn’t envision. But to the contrary, biographers, historians and even Franklin’s own writings suggest pretty clearly that it was a concept he would have supported. For that reason, we rate the statement as False.

pomt-14541	Says Jeb Bush "said he would take his pants off and moon everybody ... Nobody reports that."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/feb/14/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-jeb-bush-said-he-would-moon-ever/	Jeb Bush took Donald Trump to task over the language he has used on the campaign trail in a Republican debate in South Carolina. That included Trump’s comments about women and Sen. John McCain, as well as an accusation that he mocked a disabled reporter who has a physical impairment, which Trump denied. Trump fired back that Bush has been a potty mouth but has gotten away with it. "Two days ago, he said he would take his pants off and moon everybody," Trump said Feb. 13. "And that's fine -- nobody reports that. He gets up and says that. And then he tells me that, oh, my language was a little bit rough." Did Bush really say such a thing, and did the press ignore it? Trump’s recounting of the facts is pretty selective. Bush’s comment about mooning Trump’s spokeswoman referred us to a a Feb. 6 article by Matt Viser in the Boston Globe a few days before the New Hampshire primary. The main point of the article was that Bush had to do well in New Hampshire -- or later this month in South Carolina -- or he would face pressure to end his campaign. "Sitting on his campaign bus — laptop, turkey jerky, and coffee all nearby — Jeb Bush was befuddled over his campaign’s failure to capture more attention from the news media. "I could drop my pants," he said in an interview. "Moon the whole crowd. Everybody would be aghast, except the press guys would never notice." So it was actually Bush who suggested -- in jest here -- to the Boston Globe reporter that he could even pull down his pants and moon people and he still would get no media attention. It’s fair to say that Bush was exaggerating here to make a point about the lack of media coverage he was getting. And Bush made that point to a reporter from a major publication. And that reporter led with it in an article three days before the primary. Trump’s comments made it sound like Bush was threatening to moon people, and that’s not the case. Bush’s quote at the time was repeated on various blogs on the Internet, and The Drudge Report posted it on Facebook. Our ruling Trump said that Bush "said he would take his pants off and moon everybody ... Nobody reports that." Bush did talk about mooning people. The Boston Globe reported on Feb. 6 that Bush said, "I could drop my pants. Moon the whole crowd. Everybody would be aghast, except the press guys would never notice." Bush’s comment to the reporter was intended to show how he felt he was getting no campaign coverage. But Trump’s statement is misleading, because Bush wasn’t threatening to moon people, and his comment was indeed reported. The statement has an element of truth but ignores critical context.

"I was trying to stay away from that," Flemming said. But concerns about HB 87 -- Georgia’s immigration law -- were too hot a topic not to mention, he said. A Morris News Service article about the rally attributed to him a claim that the legislation cost farmers $400 million last year. "I said, ‘close to $400 million,’ " said Flemming, president of the Georgia AFL-CIO. Flemming said he got the number from an Oct. 4 article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which itself was based on a University of Georgia study commissioned by the Georgia Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association. It’s a pretty big number and raises a couple of questions: Is the number right and are the losses attributable to the new immigration bill? We tracked down report co-author John McKissick, a UGA distinguished professor of agriculture marketing emeritus, to explain the report. McKissick said he and co-author Sharon Kane surveyed 189 farmers representing nearly half the state’s acreage for seven fruit and vegetable crops about their labor troubles during last spring’s harvest. The crops -- including blueberries, onions and watermelons -- were chosen because they are "most dependent on timely seasonal harvest." The results showed an acute labor shortage cost those farmers just under $75 million. Since the sample size was so large -- 46.4 percent of the state’s total acreage in those crops -- McKissick said it is fair to project the direct cost to farmers was about $140 million. The report couches that conclusion because responses to the survey were voluntary, but McKissick feels confident the projection is valid. "It wasn’t a random survey," he said. "But you rarely ever get a survey that covers that amount of acreage." So, if the impact to farmers was $140 million, where did Flemming get his figure? Along with the direct impact on farmers, the UGA report projected an indirect impact of the lost harvest on the rest of the state’s economy. Truck drivers, grocery store workers, even accountants get hurt indirectly when crops don’t get to market, McKissick said. The report calculated both the direct (to the farmers) and indirect (to the rest of us) impacts of the labor shortage to be $391 million. That’s the "close to $400 million" that Flemming got from the AJC article he scanned on his way to the rally. For the record, the AJC article reported the projected loss was for the entire state economy, not just farmers. Flemming said he may have misread the story before speaking, but he said the larger point remains. "It was a significant hit for our state," he said. "This law has cost the state a lot of money. It’s hurt and is continuing to hurt." That’s the second question: Is HB 87 the culprit? The UGA report is based on losses from the spring harvest -- which is the largest and most significant harvest in the state for fruits and veggies. But HB 87 did not take effect until July 1, so how could it have caused the shortage? That’s conjecture, McKissick said, but it is not that hard to make the connection. "The bill had been passed, but even though it had not gone into effect, it created an atmosphere where people had a lot of questions," he said. The report itself does not draw that conclusion, but McKissick said both the labor shortage and legislative promises to crack down on illegal immigrants occurred simultaneously. A follow-up study has not been done, but McKissick said he expects the economic ripples will continue as farmers cut back on their spring crop acreage. "We did ask in the survey whether or not the results of the labor shortage would impact their production decisions for the fall and the following year’s crop," he said. "There was a good number that said it would affect their decisions, so there probably is a multiyear impact." So Flemming was wrong in attributing the entire loss to farmers, but he was in the neighborhood when he said agricultural losses were about $400 million if you count indirect losses. It is impossible to say with absolute certainty that HB 87 caused the labor problem, although McKissick and others believe the two are linked. There are a couple of problems with Flemming’s statement. It’s not completely clear that HB 87 is responsible for all of the farm losses. But even if it is, the amount of those losses if far less than he stated. There’s a kernel of truth to what he said. But just a kernel. That’s fits our definition of Mostly False.

pomt-11563	"There was no requirement to put in affordable housing."	true	/illinois/statements/2018/feb/06/chris-kennedy/did-chris-kennedy-need-add-affordable-housing-his-/	Democratic governor candidate Chris Kennedy stoked controversy recently by accusing Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel of pushing policies that priced low-income minority residents out of the city. But Kennedy then found himself attacked for hypocrisy by one of his rivals in the governor’s race. State Sen. Daniel Biss of Evanston claimed Kennedy, a developer, had skirted city affordable housing requirements at Wolf Point West, a downtown luxury high-rise in which Kennedy controls a key stake. In response, Kennedy told Chicago Sun-Times columnist Mary Mitchell, "there was no requirement to put in affordable housing," saying the Wolf Point property was zoned in 1973, decades before the city implemented its affordable housing ordinance. "It is nearly impossible when a building is 70 stories tall to create affordable housing because the construction cost itself is probably three times more expensive," Kennedy also said. "We created a river walk. We created a public park. We did all the things that would make us good neighbors and good corporate citizens." Chicago’s affordable housing ordinance wasn’t enacted until 2003, 30 years after the land was initially zoned, so Kennedy’s claim he was under no legal mandate makes sense on its face. But the property remained largely undeveloped for those 30 years and its zoning was amended by the city in 2013 before construction began on the tower. That made us wonder, could the zoning amendment have triggered requirements to set aside some units for affordable housing? And even if not, is creating affordable housing really as cost-prohibitive as Kennedy says? We decided to take a deeper look. Checking boxes The land on which the Wolf Point tower stands, purchased by Kennedy’s wealthy investor grandfather in the 1940s, was originally zoned in 1973 as Kennedy said. In the intervening years, the property at the intersection of the Chicago River’s three branches near the Merchandise Mart long was used as a parking facility before plans for the tower got off the ground in 2013. If Wolf Point was beholden to affordable housing requirements, it would have fallen under the city’s 2007 Affordable Requirements Ordinance, which expanded the original 2003 plan. Under the 2007 guidelines, new developments with ten or more residential units were required to designate 10 percent of those units as affordable housing or else cough up $100,000 per required unit for the city’s affordable housing fund. An existing development could have also triggered those requirements by requesting a zoning change that would have increased its density or permitted residential units on a property where such units were not previously allowed. In 2013, the Chicago City Council amended the zoning plan for the Wolf Point development. Even so, Kennedy’s campaign said the affordable housing rules didn’t apply to Wolf Point because the zoning update did not alter the floor area ratio or character of the development laid out for the property in 1973. "Since none of those types of changes were being requested, the 2007 ordinance was not required to be adhered to," Kennedy spokeswoman Rebecca Evans said in an email. She referred us to public zoning records, which show the use of the land today falls in line with the 1973 zoning. We ran Evans’ assessment by the city’s Department of Planning and Development, which confirmed that the Wolf Point property, by not deviating from its 1973 zoning outline, was grandfathered out of current affordable housing mandates. Being neighborly Even though Kennedy and his Wolf Point partners faced no legal obligation to add affordable housing, it’s also worth noting in light of his complaints about Emanuel that nothing stopped them from doing it voluntarily. Developers of similar upscale projects that are subject to the affordable housing mandate have found ways to make compliance economically feasible. For example, officials at the city Department of Planning and Development pointed to recently approved plans for a 1,011-foot high-rise called One Square Chicago across the street from Holy Name Cathedral. It must adhere to an expanded set of city affordable housing requirements approved in 2015. Under that mandate, One Square Chicago’s developers plan to rehab 22 units at a cost of $277,000 apiece inside the nearby Lawson House YMCA, a longtime single-room-occupancy residence in a historic art deco building. They’ll also be required to pay an additional $11.37 million into the city affordable housing fund. The glaring difference between One Square Chicago and Wolf Point, of course, is that developers of the new building had no choice but to comply with the affordable housing requirement, unlike Kennedy and his partners. Still, Kennedy has cast himself as an affordability advocate, ringing in the new year by alleging, without proof, that the mayor was behind a "strategic gentrification plan" to push out of the city African-Americans and other minorities. Later, speaking at a debate in Carbondale on Jan. 30, Kennedy evoked the notion that candidates for office should be held accountable to more than just the letter of the law. "The truth is, just because you don’t break a law doesn’t mean you’re innocent, and we need to hold our elected officials to a higher standard," Kennedy told the audience after lashing out at one of his Democratic rivals. Our ruling Kennedy said, "there was no requirement to put in affordable housing" at his Wolf Point development because the property was grandfathered in under rules that applied before adoption of the city’s affordable housing ordinance. Public records show zoning changes made in 2013, before construction began, did not alter the development in ways that would have triggered the ordinance. And the city department charged with reviewing new projects confirmed that, because of its original zoning date, the development escapes requirements that apply to projects zoned more recently. Kennedy has made both Chicago affordability and holding candidates to higher standards cornerstones of his campaign. So his own actions are relevant to any exploration of the affordability question. Nevertheless, Kennedy is correct in stating no legal mandate required him to include affordable housing at his Wolf Point development. We rate his claim True.

pomt-04004	Tide gauges measuring sea level in Rhode Island since 1930 have risen "maybe about 10 inches since that time."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/feb/08/janet-freedman/rhode-island-coastal-resources-geologist-says-sea-/	Sandy, the so-called "superstorm" that struck the East Coast in October 2012, did more than produce massive damage. It also got a lot of people talking about climate change. Climate scientists say Earth is warming, and most say it’s due to polluting gases that trap heat in the atmosphere. Stronger storms are one predicted result. And scientists say the storms are going to be even more damaging because the excess heat will cause sea level to rise, both by a melting of the polar ice caps and because water expands as it warms. When Janet Freedman, a coastal geologist with Rhode Island's Coastal Resources Management Council, talked about the risk of coastal flooding during an appearance on WJAR-TV’s "10 News Conference," she said the local rise in sea level is pretty clear. The levels "have been rising," she said. "In Rhode Island we have two long-term tide gauges that have been measuring the sea level since 1930 and we've seen that they've risen maybe about 10 inches since that time. "But we anticipate that with global warming, that's going to be faster, it's going to accelerate. Most models show we'll see a foot of sea-level rise as early as 2030 but definitely 2050 we expect to see sea levels that are higher than they are now." PolitiFact doesn't rate predictions, so we focused on whether sea level has really risen about 10 inches over the past eight decades -- an average of 1.25 inches every 10 years. We contacted Freedman, who sent us to several sources. The Sea Levels Online website, part of the Tides & Currents portion of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration website, has data from tide gauges around the world. Selecting "Rhode Island" sends you to data from gauges in Newport and Providence. The Newport data show that from 1930 to 2006, the mean water level has risen by 2.58 millimeters -- about a tenth of an inch -- per year. Data that take the readings through 2011 show that the overall rate over that 81-year-period has actually increased to 2.70 mm/year. We calculate the rise from 1930 to 2012 to be 211.6 mm or 8.7 inches. That's not 10 inches, but Freedman said "maybe about." (It's also important to note that there is a margin of error in these numbers because they are averages based on readings that fluctuate due to waves, tides, winds and other factors. The average may be 8.7 inches but the real number could be as high as 9.3 inches or as low as 8.1 inches. The odds of it being outside this "confidence interval" during that period are 1 in 20.) The Providence tide gauge hasn't produced as much data. Records begin around 1940 and there is a large gap in the 1950s. But the overall rate as of 2011 is also lower: 2.19 mm per year. If we extrapolate that back to 1930 and forward to 2012, that's 179.6 mm or 7.1 inches since 1930. Although the margin of error could take it as high as 8.0 inches, somewhat further from 10 inches than the Newport data. We also contacted Jon Boothroyd of the University of Rhode Island, who is designated by the U.S. Geological Survey as the state geologist. He crunches the tide gauge numbers a bit differently, taking the monthly data and averaging it for a year. He has also included more recent data. His estimate: 269 mm per 100 years. Over 82 years, that would be 220.6 mm, which is 8.7 inches as well. (The range here is 9.4 inches to 7.9 inches.) However, Boothroyd said that if you look at the actual year-to-year annual readings from Newport between 1930 and 2011, the increase has been about 270 mm, or 10.6 inches. Boothroyd said he doesn't use the Providence tide gauge data because he had doubts about it -- the readings are too far off from the Newport readings. Sea level can fluctuate if land rises or falls, for example. But between Providence and Newport, "the bedrock and the conditions are so close to one another, it doesn't make sense why that rate of sea level rise is lower than it is in Newport," he said. The gauge in Providence "is on a pier, and I don't think the pilings on that pier are sunk to bedrock. So the pier could be slowly subsiding, but the gauge shows exactly the opposite. So I don't use that number because I can't understand it. It's a really sticky wicket." These days, satellites offer the best measurement of sea levels, and they do it every 10 days across most of the world, said Steven Nerem a climate researcher at the University of Colorado at Boulder. "The satellites are all referenced to Earth's geocenter, so our data are not affected by the land motion," he said. In addition, coastal temperatures, winds, the saltiness of the water, atmospheric pressure and ocean currents all have an effect on the height of the water at individual locations, which is why researchers have to use a global average and look at long-term trends. For example, when the Pacific warms during an El Nino, "you have more precipitation over the oceans than in the continents, and you get a short-term increase in sea level," said Nerem "When you have La Nina (Pacific cooling), you get more precipitation over the continents and the water gets stored there for some period of time, so you have a temporary lowering of sea level." According to the satellite data, available at the website sealevel.colorado.edu, the global sea level has risen by 3.2 mm per year since 1993. If you assume that the rise has been steady since 1930, that would translate to an average worldwide increase of 10.3 inches. (Range: 9.0 inches up to 11.6 inches.) Is the pace of sea level rise increasing? "That's the $10 million question," said Nerem. "Over the last 100 years there is a suggestion that there is a small acceleration. If you just look at the satellite data, we don't see an acceleration. So over the last 20 years, it may just be too small, given all this variability, to detect." Boothroyd, however, said, "There is some indication that worldwide sea level has risen at a faster rate since 1990. Our graph suggests that is true for Newport" citing the uptick in 2010 and 2011. Freedman said Boothroyd's numbers, which show a slightly higher annual increase, may be pointing to sea levels rising faster today. "This trend seems to suggest that we are seeing acceleration in sea level rise over the last 20 years, but because there is so much variability in sea levels we really need forty years of sea levels to say that with scientific certainty." Our ruling Janet Freedman, a geologist with Rhode Island's Coastal Resources Management Council, said, "In Rhode Island we have two long-term tide gauges that have been measuring the sea level since 1930 and we've seen that they've risen maybe about 10 inches since that time." Her "maybe about" phrase gives her some wiggle room. The long-term trend in Newport doesn't quite measure up to 10 inches. It's 8.7 inches. But the actual annual measurements at the beginning and end of that time period meet the truth test, mostly because of a steep -- and not explained -- increase over the last few years. The Providence tide gauge data, on the other hand, show a much smaller trend over that time period -- it would be just over 7 inches. Freedman's overarching point that sea levels have been rising is certainly true, and that's borne out by satellite data. Pinning down the actual size of the rise is as difficult as measuring the precise height of a wave. Because her statement is essentially on-target but needs clarification or additional perspective, we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-08538	Says "the headlines … tell the story" of how Walker has "mismanaged" Milwaukee County	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/03/tom-barrett/democratic-governor-candidate-tom-barrett-says-hea/	It may be a politician’s dream to determine the headlines that go on the front page of the morning newspaper. In a new attack ad, Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Tom Barrett makes it a reality, using purported replicas of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel to slam rival Republican Scott Walker for "mismanagement" of Milwaukee County. The 30-second TV spot offers a trifecta of complaints: wasted money, exploding debt and shoddy oversight of county operations. The ad aims to undercut a main Walker selling point -- his fiscal management as Milwaukee County executive. In the ad, the narrator declares "the headlines ... tell the story." But do they? Instead of using shots of actual newspapers, Barrett’s ad creates a computer-generated version of the Journal Sentinel’s front page and places various headlines at the top of the page -- regardless of where the stories actually appeared. There are a host of other tricks involved: Headlines and allegations are mismatched for effect and photos of Walker are added to amplify his role and responsibility in each item. In response, Walker has issued a statement saying he is "exploring legal action" based on the ad. The Journal Sentinel has complained to the Barrett campaign about the false and misleading headlines associated with its trademark, said Editor Martin Kaiser. In some cases, the Barrett claim made through the narrator may be correct, or partly so. But in this item we are evaluating the manner in which they are presented and whether the overall message -- that the headlines support the claims -- is accurate. The ad opens with a cut from a Walker TV ad. In it, Walker says: "It seems like every time I pick up a newspaper there’s another headline about our tax dollars being wasted." The first claim comes when the narrator steps in, saying: "No kidding, Scott Walker. You mismanaged Milwaukee County so badly, spending went up $400 million." As this is spoken, an image of a newspaper with the headline "Millions down the drain" appears on the screen. The headline is from a story that appeared on JSOnline.com on Feb. 14, 2009, and in the Journal Sentinel the next day, concerning fraud in the $340 million Wisconsin Shares program, the state’s child-care subsidy program. But Walker was not mentioned or pictured in the story. At the time, the county did run some aspects of the state program. But the story was about overpayments to child-care providers. Those payments are made by the state from federal funds, not from the county budget, according to County Auditor Jerome Heer and Lisa Jo Marks, former interim head of the county’s Health and Human Services Department. Under Walker, county spending has gone up more than $390 million, which approaches the $400 million cited in the ad. But as we noted when we reviewed a claim in an earlier Barrett ad about rising county spending, the bulk of the increase was due to the county taking in more state and federal dollars -- not due to budget increases by Walker. In fact, Democrats have complained for years that Walker has cut the budget too much. In any case, the presentation leaves the viewer with the impression the $400 million is what has "gone down the drain." The story did not say that. And the ad does not support that. In the second claim, the narrator declares: "County debt has skyrocketed 85 percent." As the allegation is made, viewers see a headline that reads: "Milwaukee County deficit projected at $6 million this year." The headline appeared on a story posted on JSOnline on May 20, 2010, but the date shown in the Barrett ad on the mock Journal Sentinel is June 22, 2010. The story appeared on page 3B, not the front page. Again, Walker’s picture is added, when it did not appear in print or online. In this case, Walker was part of the story, which looked at the projection at the time of how much of a deficit the county was facing in the 2010 budget. Walker and county supervisors are aiming to address that one-time deficit by making cuts to assure the budget finishes in the black. In any case, the annual deficit is much different than the debt, a measure of long-term obligations of the county. On this point, county debt has risen 85 percent under Walker, according to Cynthia Archer, the county’s director of administrative services. The major reason for the increase is that, in March 2009, the county issued $400 million in pension obligation bonds that are to be repaid over 25 years. While the bonds are a new debt, the obligation isn’t new -- the county already was on the hook to pay the future benefits. What’s more, the county didn’t simply borrow the money. The county took the $400 million and invested it as part of an effort to shore up the pension fund. The county ultimately could end up paying more, but in the first year the return on the investment was high enough that the county paid $8.5 million less in pension benefits than it would have without the approach. (We also covered pension-related claims in a review of another Barrett ad). Like the first claim, the headline does not support -- or even relate to -- the spoken claim. In the third claim, the narrator says: "And the state had to take over your welfare program thanks to all the money you wasted." The headline shown: "State takes over county’s public assistance program." Although Walker’s picture was not included with the story, the ad shows a jubilant Walker in front of an American flag. The headline is taken from an online version of a Journal Sentinel story that was posted Feb. 3, 2009. The story told about the state stripping Milwaukee County of its role in administering food aid, child care and medical assistance programs. The state said the move was prompted by years of county mismanagement. Walker contended that state underfunding over the years was a big contributor to the problems. Of the three claims, the link between the headline and the narration is closest to being on the mark -- though it presents a distorted view of how it appeared in print. "Walker’s right," the narrator concludes, "the headlines do tell the story. Scott Walker ... Can’t trust him with our money, can’t trust him to tell the truth." Phil Walzak, Barrett campaign spokesman, defended the ad's assertions of mismanagement and the specific claims. For instance, he said the "millions down the drain" story was relevant to Walker's record because the county was responsible for preventing fraud in the child-care program. Walzak said he couldn’t comment on the use of Journal Sentinel headlines because of legal issues. The ad, he said, is airing in "multiple markets," but not in the Milwaukee area at this time. The fact that the ad has not been posted with other ads on Barrett’s campaign website "is not by design," but because other material is being uploaded to the site, Walzak said. The ad will be posted soon, he said. Where does this leave us? In taking his swing at Walker, Barrett creates phony versions of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and trades on the newspaper’s credibility when he declares "the headlines … tell the story" of Walker’s mismanagement of the county. But the ad uses digital trickery to mix-and-match headlines, give stories greater emphasis than they originally received and to amplify Walker’s role in each by adding photos to the layout. In the art world, that would be considered forgery. There may be elements of truth to some of the claims in isolation, but the way they are presented give viewers a false impression of what happened, how it was covered and the role Walker played. We’ll make our ruling clear: Pants on Fire. (Note: As of Oct. 7, 2010, the Barrett campaign removed the video from YouTube.)	None	Tom Barrett	None	None	None	2010-10-03T09:00:00	2010-09-30	['None']
pomt-09329	"(Pete) Sessions has held at least two fundraisers at adult-themed clubs and made no apologies."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/apr/13/lone-star-project/lone-star-project-says-us-rep-pete-sessions-held-t/	Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, has been getting flak after the RNC reimbursed a staffer some $2,000 spent at a risque club in Los Angeles. So why, asks the Democrat-backing Lone Star Project, is U.S. Rep. Pete Sessions of Dallas, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, off the hook for "his fundraising at Las Vegas strip clubs?" The Lone Star Project is steered by Matt Angle, director of the Texas Democratic Trust and former aide to then-U.S. Rep. Martin Frost, D-Dallas, whom Sessions beat in 2004. On its Web site, the group says it's an arm of the Lone Star Fund political action committee, offering "political and legislative analysis to help individuals, organizations and the press see beyond the rhetoric and misinformation typically provided by the current Republican state leadership in Texas and Texas Republicans in Washington." "Sessions has held at least two fundraisers at adult-themed clubs and made no apologies," according to an April 8 press release from the group. In the wake of the RNC's recent brouhaha, we wondered if Angle & Company bared the truth about Sessions' events. As back-up to his claim, Angle pointed us to a video attached to the press release. The video, made and uploaded to YouTube this month by the Lone Star Project, shows scenes from Forty Deuce, a Las Vegas club where Sessions has previously confirmed he held an event in 2007 to raise money for his political committee, Pete PAC, which gives money to Republican political candidates. The PAC spent more than $5,000 to rent the club for the occasion, according to federal finance disclosures. Included with the video: A sound clip from the American Public Media radio show Marketplace. On the clip, Sessions says: "We do a Las Vegas fundraiser every year, and uh, not only raise money, but see Las Vegas. It's a beautiful town." Marketplace reporter Steve Henn replies: "Forty Deuce is a strip club." According to the clip, Sessions says: "You know, I've never seen that. It is what I would call a burlesque show, where there's a woman who comes out and has a dress on... uh, she never gets naked. There's no nudity, there's no nudity in there." According to an undated promotional advertisement for Forty Deuce, the club calls itself a "World-Famous Burlesque," with "striptease that is very empowering to women" and "appeals to both sexes." The original Forty Deuce opened in Los Angeles in 2002 and closed in 2008. The Las Vegas Forty Deuce venue in the Mandalay Bay casino was open from 2004 to 2007. Since 2008, the Forty Deuce show has played Friday nights at its new Hollywood venue. Lana Gates, events director for Forty Deuce and other Kane ventures, told us "there is no nudity in the show — it's a mix of sexiness and whimsy, pleasing to both genders." In the Marketplace segment, Kane offered this distinction about his burlesque shows: "The key component would be to have girls who were dancers taking their clothes off, not just girls taking their clothes off." Promotional video of Forty Deuce's scantily-clad dancers crawling across the floor and grinding on musicians indicated the show is adult-oriented, as the Lone Star Project says. Published reports reinforce that conclusion. In 2002, The New York Times wrote of the Forty Deuce in Los Angeles: "The dancer, Carolina Cerisola, gyrated and fox-trotted while peeling off her gown, a pair of long violet gloves and a pink bra. When she kicked off a pair of spangled black panties, they grazed the back of the bartender's head." And writing in The New York Times' travel section, Frommer's Travel Guides describes the Las Vegas joint as "the first establishment to cash in on the return of the high-class hoochie girl." Zagat, on its Web site, calls it "good for a bachelor party." Unnoted by the Lone Star Project: Sessions raised money for his leadership PAC, People for Enterprise, Trade and Economic Growth (PETE), at the Forty Deuce club before he was elected by House Republicans in November 2008 to lead the NRCC. So, unlike GOP chairman Steele, he did not yet hold a national party post. The second fundraiser cited by the Lone Star Project, also for Sessions' PAC, took place at Tao Las Vegas in February 2009. The Tao complex includes an Asian-cuisine restaurant, topless pool and nightclub (the club promises "a happy ending" on its Vegas billboards). The Washington Post reported that unnamed Republicans had said the 2009 fundraiser was held at Tao's restaurant, which, according to Restaurants & Institutions magazine, ranked as the highest-grossing independent restaurant in the United States — a title it still claims today. According to federal financial disclosures, Sessions' PAC spent about $4,390 on food and beverages at the restaurant. What we found: The restaurant is two floors down from Tao's nightclub, which has nearly nude dancers that restaurant patrons 21 and older can go upstairs to see. Pennapa Chutima, a hostess at the restaurant, said it's not adult-themed. She said: "It's a peaceful calm environment. Families are more than welcome. We are stroller-friendly." The city of Las Vegas classifies local clubs as topless clubs with liquor, adult night club establishments or as nightclubs. Tao's club — which doesn't have burlesque or striptease — is listed among nightclubs. Finally, we didn't find record of Sessions airing fundraising regrets. Neither Sessions nor his aides agreed to our requests for on-the-record interviews. The naked truth?

pomt-07716	DeKalb County has cut more money from its general fund budget "than any local government in the Atlanta metro region."	true	/georgia/statements/2011/mar/04/burrell-ellis/dekalb-ceo-says-he-wields-big-budget-ax/	DeKalb County Chief Executive Officer Burrell Ellis lost a recent battle with county commissioners on his proposal to raise property taxes to help balance the budget. The seven-member board chose instead to order an additional $33.6 million in cuts, insisting there’s more fat to be trimmed. Ellis and some DeKalb officials worry the additional cuts might take a toll on public safety in the county. Ellis vented. "We’ve cut $109 million. I think we’ve done more than any local government in the metro Atlanta region," he told reporters after the board’s vote on Feb. 22. The second part of that quote piqued our curiosity. Has DeKalb cut more than anyone else? DeKalb’s communications director, Burke Brennan, explained and offered a slight correction. Ellis was discussing how much money he and the commissioners have cut from DeKalb’s general fund budget -- which pays for police, fire rescue and most county services -- since he became CEO in January 2009. DeKalb’s budget was $636 million in 2008. With the additional cuts adopted by commissioners last month, the general fund budget is about $529 million, county officials say. That’s actually a $107 million decrease, Brennan said, not $109 million. There are 73 cities, counties and towns in the 10 counties that are part of the Atlanta Regional Commission. It didn’t seem fair to compare the budgets of, say, Clayton County’s Lake City (population 2,886) to DeKalb, which had a population of 747,274, according to the most recent U.S. census data. We decided, instead, to compare DeKalb to the similarly sized governments of Cobb, Fulton and Gwinnett counties and the city of Atlanta, which all have populations in excess of 500,000. DeKalb, Fulton and Gwinnett base their budgets on a calendar-year basis. Atlanta’s budget year begins each July 1 and ends June 30. Cobb’s budget year begins Oct. 1 and ends Sept. 30. We compared the last four budgets adopted by each government. In 2008, Fulton County’s general fund budget was nearly $671.5 million. The county’s budget has declined in each year to its 2011 budget of nearly $595 million. That’s an 11 percent decline of $76.5 million. Fulton officials told us they actually spent $35 million to $60 million less in 2008, 2009 and 2010. Gwinnett County’s general fund budget has gone up and down since 2008. In 2008, it was nearly $456 million. It rose to nearly $510 million in 2010. This year’s budget is $448.6 million, $7 million -- or 2 percent -- less than it was in 2008. Atlanta, like DeKalb, has cut its general fund budget significantly since 2008. The city budget was about $645 million in fiscal year 2008, which began July 1, 2007, and ended June 30, 2008. The city cut hundreds of jobs from the payroll in fiscal year 2009, resulting in a general fund budget of nearly $571 million. The current fiscal year budget, which ends June 30, is approximately $559 million. That’s an $86 million difference that is 13 percent lower than fiscal year 2008. Cobb County’s general fund budget for 2008 was nearly $338 million. The county’s general fund budget includes most of the same services as the others, but there are some differences. For example, a portion of the property taxes goes specifically to the fire department budget, which is about $65 million for the current fiscal year. The fiscal year budget for 2011 is $328 million, a 3 percent drop from FY 2008. Since 2008, the numbers show DeKalb has cut more money from its general budget than any of the governments its size. The $107 million DeKalb has cut amounts to a 17 percent decrease over that time span. That is a larger percentage than the other governments. It appears CEO Ellis is on the money with this claim. We rate his statement as True.	None	Burrell Ellis	None	None	None	2011-03-04T06:00:00	2011-02-22	['Atlanta', 'DeKalb_County,_Georgia']
pomt-12410	"If Donald Trump would stay home from Mar-a-Lago one weekend, it would pay the entire meals on wheels budget for the state of Missouri for almost two years."	false	/missouri/statements/2017/may/23/claire-mccaskill/false-mccaskill-says-1-mar-lago-trip-could-fund-mi/	Democrats are criticizing President Donald Trump for proposed budget cuts to social programs. They also aren’t happy how Trump often spends his weekends away from the White House visiting one of his properties. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., put the two criticisms together recently. "The thing that I'm most disappointed about so far, and this is a little thing, but Trump's budget cut the meals on wheels program. Completely, gone," McCaskill said at an April 14, 2017, town hall. "If we are not doing meals on wheels, it is cutting off our nose to spite our face, because the people who can't get nutrition at home and don’t stay well end up in a nursing home, and you end up paying the bill, so meals and wheels is a small investment," McCaskill said. "If Donald Trump would stay home from Mar-a-Lago one weekend, if he would stay home from Mar-a-Lago for one weekend, it would pay the entire meals and wheels budget for the state of Missouri for almost two years. One weekend." McCaskill continued. "So, if he -- he has not called me ever -- and there hasn't been a particular reach out to me ... but if he did, I would say you know what I would do if I were you, it'd be a really smart idea. I would announce on a Friday I'm not going to Mar-a-Lago, and this week I’m going to make sure that the money that we would've spent, the $3 million that we would've spent goes to the meals on wheels program in Tennessee or in Kansas, or in how about Missouri." Trump's budget proposal would cut $192 billion from federal nutritional assistance programs, the New York Times has reported. The question of this fact-check is: Would one fewer trip to Mar-a-Lago save Missouri's meals on wheels programs for two years? Trump’s Mar-a-Lago trips Pinning down the cost of a trip to Mar-a-Lago is difficult. As PolitiFact has previously reported, the closest thing we have is a 2016 Government Accountability Office report detailing the costs of a 2013 trip taken by President Barack Obama. The trip was four days from Chicago to Palm Beach, Fla., and cost $3.6 million. But the author of that report has said it should not be used to estimate the cost of Trump’s travel to Florida. "We wouldn’t recommend substituting the numbers from President Obama’s trip to any other trip," Brian Lepore, director of defense capabilities and management at GAO, told PolitiFact in April. (We rated a fact-check saying Trump's trips cost $3.6 million Half True.) When the president travels, generally several military aircraft are involved. These include Air Force One, carrying the president, his entourage and guests, cargo planes packing motorcade limousines and other equipment, and aircraft to transport personnel who conduct security sweeps before the president arrives. This is the main driver of presidential travel costs. Air Force One alone costs nearly $180,000 per hour of flight as of 2012, according to the Congressional Research Service. The GAO report found that total air and boat support accounted for more than 85 percent of the $3.6 million spent on Obama’s 2013 trip. But these costs change significantly from trip to trip, so it’s hard to nail down the average cost. For example, a president could take two identical weekend trips to Palm Beach, both trips requiring a C-130 Hercules transport aircraft. But one trip could cost a good deal more than the other depending on where the C-130 has to fly in from. Military logistics could mean that one week it comes from Delaware, the next from Texas. Or, if the president’s event schedule for one of the Palm Beach weekends requires a helicopter, an additional or bigger plane might be necessary to transport the helicopter. Another group has estimated Trump's trips to Florida have cost much less. Judicial Watch, a conservative group, said public records show that two Trump weekend Mar-a-Lago trips cost $1.28 million. The authority on the matter, the GAO, has accepted a request to examine the costs of Trump’s Mar-A-Lago trips. Unfortunately that report isn’t available yet. Missouri’s meals on wheels costs While there are difficulties estimating the cost of a trip to Mar-A-Lago, McCaskill’s bigger issue is with how she discussed Missouri's meals on wheels budget. Meals on wheels is a catch-all term for companies or organizations that provide nutrion assistance to low-income people, primarily seniors. Meals on Wheels is one specific organization that provides delivered meals, but it's only one. McCaskill spokeswoman Sarah Feldman said McCaskill was speaking specifically about one federal funding source, Community Development Block Grants. The block grants help fund nutrition assistance programs in five Missouri cities: St. Louis, St. Charles, St. Peters, St. Joseph and Independence. In fiscal year 2016, grants for home-delivered meals totaled $356,900. Spread over two years, that's a total of $713,800. What's not clear from McCaskill's comments, however, is that meals on wheels programs in Missouri include much larger funding streams. Jenny Bertolette, spokeswoman for Meals on Wheels America, said the main source of funding for meals on wheels is the Older Americans Act. That program provided about $10.5 million in federal funding for meal assistance in Missouri, according to a 2017 fact sheet (the figures are from 2014). That's way more -- in one year -- than any estimate for a Mar-a-Lago trip. And the Older Americans Act isn't the only source of funding. For instance, Meals on Wheels of Greater St. Louis, says it does not receive any government funding. Yet it spent nearly $340,000 in 2013 on program expenses, according to required government filings. Our ruling McCaskill said that if Trump stayed home from Mar-a-Lago for one weekend, then it would pay for the cost of meals on wheels in Missouri for two years. We don't know how much it costs for Trump to visit Mar-a-Lago for the weekend. A GAO report said it cost $3.6 million for Obama to take a four-day, two-city trip in 2013, but the author of that report said that figure should not be used to make other estimates. Another group pegged the cost much lower. More problematic, McCaskill only looked at Community Development Block Grants when considering the cost of home-delivered meal programs in Missouri. The comparison falls apart entirely when you look at a fuller set of funding streams. We rate this claim False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Update (5 p.m. May 23): This post was updated to include additional comments from McCaskill. The rating remains unchanged.

pomt-06535	"Today, you have six financial institutions, the largest six, that have assets that are the equivalent of 60 percent of the GDP of the United States of America."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/06/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-six-bank-companies-have-assets/	During an Oct. 4, 2011, interview on MSNBC, host Ed Schultz and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., discussed the "Occupy Wall Street" protests, which are targeting the financial services sector. Sanders offered a statistic designed to demonstrate the power of American banks. Sanders suggested that many of the protesters "have not seen the president be as strong as he should be on Wall Street," saying they want the federal government to take tougher measures against financial-services companies. "Ed, today, you have six financial institutions, the largest six, that have assets that are the equivalent of 60 percent of the GDP of the United States of America," Sanders said. (GDP stands for gross domestic product.) We wondered whether Sanders’ math was correct. When we contacted Sanders’ office, a spokesman provided testimony to a congressional oversight panel by Simon Johnson, a professor of entrepreneurship at the MIT Sloan School of Management. "Our six largest bank holding companies currently have assets valued at just over 63 percent of GDP," Johnson testified, citing figures for the fourth quarter of 2010. "This is up from around 55 percent of GDP before the crisis (e.g., 2006) and no more than 17 percent of GDP in 1995." We wanted to find the original statistics, and we located them in a chart posted by the National Information Center, the federal repository of data about banks and other institutions for which the Federal Reserve has a supervisory, regulatory or research interest. The chart lists the 50 biggest bank holding companies as of June 30, 2011. Here are the top six and their total assets: 1. Bank of America Corp., $2.264 trillion 2. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., $2.246 trillion 3. Citigroup Inc., $1.957 trillion 4. Wells Fargo & Co., $1.260 trillion 5. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., $937 billion 6. Morgan Stanley, $831 billion Together, the top six companies’ assets were $9.495 trillion. For the second part of the equation -- gross domestic product -- we turned to the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis. Though the time spans don’t line up perfectly, we decided to use the GDP figure for 2010, the most recent full year. That figure is $14.527 trillion. Dividing these top banks’ assets by the national GDP produces a result of 65 percent -- which is actually a slightly larger percentage than Sanders had indicated, but certainly in the ballpark. To make sure we weren’t missing something, we contacted a few experts on financial services issues. They offered a few caveats: • The comparison is a bit of apples vs. oranges. The banks’ asset figures are an aggregation measured at a single point in time, whereas the GDP figure is an aggregation of goods and services measured over time. "This distinction is the equivalent to a comparison of your net worth with your personal income," said Lawrence White, an economist at New York University’s Stern School of Business. "Economists generally don't find these sorts of comparisons very useful or interesting. So the best that can be said is that these comparisons provide a rough sense of comparative magnitudes." • The data are constantly moving. "Several of these banks, especially Bank of America, have lost significant" value since the figures were published in June 2011, said Satya Thallam, director of the Financial Markets Working Group at George Mason University's Mercatus Center. The denominator, GDP, is always changing, as well. So, any estimate is true for a specific point in time, but possibly out of date not long after it’s made. • Banks’ overseas holdings significantly complicate the comparison. For starters, the comparison Sanders is making doesn’t mean that these banks own 60 percent of the U.S. wealth, because some of these banks’ assets are in overseas holdings. However, Sanders appears to be on safe ground with his phrasing, since all he said was that the two dollar figures were "equivalent." Potentially more problematic for Sanders is that the assets-to-GDP ratio for the top six bank companies in the U.S. are actually quite modest when compared to the biggest banks in other nations. A 2010 study by J.P. Morgan listed the 25 biggest banks internationally in 2008, along with the percentages of their home country’s GDP. The highest was UBS, with 376 percent of Switzerland’s GDP. And six other banks all had assets as large as their home country’s GDP -- Credit Suisse Group of Switzerland (218 percent), Dexia of Belgium (180 percent), Fortis of the Netherlands (155 percent), Royal Bank of Scotland of the United Kingdom (131 percent), Barclays of the United Kingdom (112 percent) and BNP Paribas of France (101 percent). All of these dwarf the combined holdings of the top six banks in the U.S., in part because America’s GDP is so much larger than the GDP of these other nations. The significance of this fact for Sanders’ assertion, however, is less clear. "This doesn't tell us what is a ‘proper’ or ‘appropriate’ number," Thallam said. "One might reply that other countries are much more concentrated, but that only means they're worse -- not that we're in a good position." Some scholars, he added, have said that even at current concentration levels, U.S. banks should be broken up because they create a "too big to fail" problem. "On the other hand, people for years said that banking exhibited economies of scale, so consolidation was natural," Thallam said. Our ruling Sanders’ math is correct -- in fact, the percentage he offers is actually a little low. And he’s careful to say only that the banks’ assets are only "equivalent" to 60 percent of the United States’ GDP, not that the banks own 60 percent of the United States. Sanders doesn’t note that big banks in other countries are far bigger, compared to their nations’ GDP, than the U.S. banks are. Still, on balance, we rate his statement True.

pomt-04537	"The Doherty Campaign, unlike the Cicilline Campaign, is funded mostly by individual donors -- not the big PACs that Cicilline relies on."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/sep/30/brendan-doherty/brendan-doherty-says-most-david-cicilline-campaign/	Because candidates need money to pay staff and buy the advertisements designed to sway voters, it's not surprising that the source of those funds can be a matter of contention. Brendan Doherty, the Republican seeking to unseat Democratic U.S. Rep. David Cicilline, issued a news release Sept. 26 claiming that Cicilline is getting most of his money from large political action committees, not the individual donors that mark a grass-roots campaign. Here's the statement: "The Doherty Campaign, unlike the Cicilline Campaign, is funded mostly by individual donors -- not the big PACs that Cicilline relies on." To us, "mostly" means Cicilline is getting the majority -- more than half -- of his campaign funds from PACs. Because incumbents wield a lot of influence, especially members of Congress, it wouldn't be surprising if Cicilline was getting a lot of money from PACs, many of which are created by groups with specific agendas, such as businesses and labor unions. But we decided to check. Our quick go-to source for campaign finance information is OpenSecrets.org, the nonpartisan nonprofit website of the Center for Responsive Politics. Its latest tally for the Cicilline-Doherty race shows that as of Aug. 22, 2012, Cicilline had received $413,806 in PAC contributions versus $109,250 in PAC money raised by Doherty. That represents 24 percent of the money raised by Cicilline and 10 percent raised by Doherty. That's not a majority for either campaign. In fact, most of Cicilline's money -- 68 percent -- has come from large contributions (classified as donations of more than $200) from individual donors. An identical percentage -- 68 percent -- of Doherty's campaign funds also comes from large individual donations. If you add in the smaller contributions from individuals, Cicilline got 75 percent of his money from individuals compared to 86 percent for Doherty. We e-mailed the Doherty campaign Sept. 27 asking if they were using a different source for its claim. Spokesman Dave Layman focused on the OpenSecrets data we were looking at. "The point we were trying to make is that Mr. Doherty has a larger percentage of individual contributions and relies far less on PAC money," he said in an e-mail. "Perhaps, we should have said: 'Both campaigns rely mostly on individual contributions, but about a quarter of Mr. Cicilline’s campaign contributions ($413,806) come from PACs, whereas just 10% of Mr. Doherty’s campaign contributions ($109,250) come from PACs.' We should have made that clearer," Layman wrote. Our ruling Brendan Doherty said his campaign, "unlike the Cicilline Campaign, is funded mostly by individual donors -- not the big PACs that Cicilline relies on." Campaign finance data show that both campaigns are funded mostly by individual donors. Cicilline may have gotten more money from political action committees than Doherty has, but the scope -- 24 percent of $1.7 million raised -- doesn't even come close to supporting a statement suggesting that Cicilline is getting most of his funds from PACs. We rate Doherty's claim False. (Get updates from PolitiFact Rhode Island on Twitter: @politifactri. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)

pomt-00247	"Since passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Walmart 'increased their starting wage to $11/hr & has given about $400 million in bonuses.'"	true	/missouri/statements/2018/oct/05/ann-wagner/walmart-raised-wages-gave-bonuses-ann-wagner-claim/	With the 2018 midterms on the way, many Republicans are turning to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to bolster their campaigns. You can count Rep. Ann Wagner of Missouri’s 2nd Congressional District among them. On Aug. 27, Wagner tweeted, "The #TaxCutsandJobsAct is delivering real results. Since passage, @Walmart increased their starting wage to $11/hr & has given about $400 million in bonuses." We thought Wagner’s claim might be too large, so we decided to see if she was right. Good news from the boss In December 2017, President Donald Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law, restructuring tax laws for both private individuals and major corporations. The bill cuts corporate tax rates to 21 percent from the previous 35 percent. Republicans at the time said the move would almost double the standard deduction for citizens, would encourage investments and lead to overall economic growth. In January, Walmart President and CEO Doug McMillon announced in a blog post to employees the company’s plans due to the president’s tax overhaul. He said workers’ starting wages would be increased to $11. He also previewed bonuses to workers ineligible for the hourly wage increase that ranged from $200 to $1,000 depending on time spent within the company. "As you know, the president and Congress have approved a lower business tax rate," McMillon wrote. "Given these changes, we have an opportunity to accelerate a few pieces of our investment plan." Walmart was already planning these payments and could afford them before the tax reform, but the law fast-tracked the process. Wagner’s office linked us to a January CNBC article announcing Walmart planned to distribute these raises and bonuses and that the payments were projected to start the following month. The office also sent another article from the St. Louis Business Journal about a St. Louis Walmart receiving regular bonuses because of "their store’s performance the previous quarter." In its original announcement, Walmart said it planned to spend $400 million on one time bonuses. The company would not confirm the exact amount but said the number was close to its original projection. Justin Rushing, the director of corporate communications for Walmart, said "the raises went into effect on Feb. 17, and showed up on the paycheck our associates received on March 8. This is the same paycheck they all received their one-time bonus." Our ruling Wagner said that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was creating real results. "Since passage, @Walmart increased their starting wage to $11/hr & has given about $400 million in bonuses." Wagner is correct that Walmart made the payments and that it credited the legislation for the company’s actions. For this we rate Wagner’s claim True.

pomt-05062	"In the last 10 years, only one piece of legislation has been cosponsored and passed by" John Duncan Jr.	pants on fire!	/tennessee/statements/2012/jul/07/nick-ciparro/opponent-says-duncan-has-sponsored-piece-legislati/	U.S. Rep. John J. Duncan Jr., R-Knoxville, has been in Congress for nearly 2½ decades, so his voting record should be chock full of fodder for his political opponents to exploit. But one of his opponents in the 2012 primary, Republican Nick Ciparro of Knoxville, sees Duncan’s record as sorely lacking substance. "In the last 10 years, only one piece of legislation has been cosponsored and passed by Mr. Duncan Jr.," Ciparro wrote on his campaign website. Lawmakers routinely sign on as cosponsors of scores of bills, so it seemed doubtful to us that just one of the bills that Duncan has cosponsored in the past 10 years has become law. Ciparro backed off a bit when we asked him to back up that claim. What he meant, Ciparro said, was that Duncan has written just one bill over the past decade that has been signed into law. He has since changed his website to say that only one piece of legislation "has been written and passed" by Duncan. While recognizing that Ciparro adjusted the wording on his website, at PolitiFact we fact-check the original claim, not revisions made after a fact-based claim is questioned. Ciparro makes other claims about Duncan’s productivity on his website, but we wondered if he did overreach with the original claim about how much legislation had been "cosponsored and passed" by Duncan. Duncan’s spokesman, Patrick Newton, called Ciparro’s claim ridiculous and provided us with a list of bills that the congressman has authored and cosponsored over the past decade. Based upon that count, Duncan has cosponsored 334 bills since 2001. Seventy-three of those bills have become law. We did our own research using the Library of Congress’ Thomas online bill-tracking system. Our numbers were a little higher than those provided by the congressman’s office. According to our search, Duncan has sponsored or cosponsored 102 bills that have become law since 2001. Duncan’s office also points out, rightly so, that it can be misleading to judge a lawmaker’s productivity by the number of bills he has sponsored or cosponsored that have been signed into law. Both the House and the Senate often combine several pieces of legislation into one larger bill and then push the larger bill through the legislative process. So a measure that a congressman has championed could be attached to a larger bill and become law without the lawmaker’s name ever appearing anywhere on that legislation. In fact, one measure that took that route was a resolution that Duncan sponsored to name a veterans outpatient clinic in Knoxville after William C. Tallent, a World War II hero who also served as Knox County’s finance commissioner for 28 years. The resolution was enacted and eventually became law after it was included in a broader veterans appropriations bill. Duncan’s name does not appear on the final legislation, even though he introduced the original measure. It’s also worth noting that few bills ever become law. In the 111th Congress, which spanned the 2009 and 2010 calendar years, 13,683 measures were introduced in the House and Senate, yet only 385 of them became law, according to the Congressional Record. Our ruling The public record shows Rep. Duncan has sponsored or cosponsored at least six dozen bills that have been enacted into law over the past decade. At its best, Ciparro’s claim showed a basic lack of understanding of how Congress works. At its worst, it is a ridiculous distortion of the truth. We rate it Pants on Fire.

pomt-14576	In Virginia, "people are going and getting marriage licenses who are 12 and 13, and 14 and 15 years old."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2016/feb/08/jill-vogel/vogel-says-virginia-children-young-12-are-getting-/	State Sen. Jill Holtzman Vogel recently surprised her colleagues while pushing for a bill to prevent underage marriages. "People are going and getting marriage licenses who are 12 and 13, and 14 and 15 years old," Vogel, R-Fauquier, said during a Jan. 27 appearance before the Senate Courts of Justice Committee. We wondered if she was right. Virginia law now sets 16 as the minimum age for marriage, although exceptions are allowed in cases when a child is pregnant. Minors are required to get the consent of a parent or legal guardian before getting married. If they’re under 16, a marriage license is issued by a local circuit court clerk. Vogel co-sponsored a bill that would set the minimum marriage age at 18, unless a court has granted the minor the rights of an adult. Anyone seeking to go around the new age restriction by getting married out of state would face up to a $500 fine and up to six months in jail. She later amended the measure that lowered the allowed marriage age to 16 with no exceptions, even for pregnancy. Vogel said she was introducing the measure to stop situations in which young children are being coerced into marriage. "We are failing children miserably in Virginia," she told the committee. We asked Vogel’s office for the senator’s evidence that Virginians as young as 12 are getting married. Tricia Stiles, Vogel’s legislative assistant, directed us to the Tahirih Justice Center, a nonprofit focusing on violence against immigrant women and girls that researches underage marriage. The group, based in Falls Church, supports Vogel’s bill. Jeanne Smoot, senior counsel for the center, said the information came from a chart the group received last year from Virginia Department of Health showing the age of the youngest person married in Virginia each year from 2004 to 2013. The chart shows: • In 2004, 2006 and 2007, the youngest bride was 12. • In 2007 and 2010, the youngest groom was 12. • Throughout the 2004-13 span, there were Virginia brides and grooms ages 13, 14 and 15. We contacted the Department of Health to see if it could quantify the number of brides and grooms younger than 16. Maribeth Brewster, spokeswoman for the department, sent us some updated data on the number of marriages of children ages 12 to 14 from 2004 to 2014. We also pulled additional data on marriages of 15-year-olds from the Department of Health website. Those figures show that, during the span, there were: • four 13-year-old brides; • twenty-four 14-year-old brides; • at least 170 brides who were 15 years olds; and • grooms who ranged in aged from 14 to 16. In a follow-up email, Brewster said that preliminary figures for 2015 show the youngest bride was 14 and the youngest groom was 15. You may have noticed that the latest figures don’t show any 12-year-olds getting married during that span. Brewster told us that the earlier information the department sent to the Tahirih Justice Center about 12-year-olds was wrong. The department’s registrar, Janet Rainey, wrote to us that some incorrect birthdays for brides and grooms had been entered into a database. That said, it’s still troubling that 13-, 14- and 15-year-olds are marrying in Virginia. Smoot said, "I think that we can’t know what all the stories are behind those statistics, but I can tell you that when you have someone, an adolescent that young, there is a greater likelihood that the parents are coercing them to get married and it is not of their own free will." She said Virginia is not unique in this regard; her group released a report in October citing instances of children younger than 15 being married in Texas, New Jersey and Maryland. A Department of Health chart shows than since 2010, most marriages of Virginia children younger than 16 have occurred in rural counties in the Southwest and Southside regions of the state. Vogel amended setting the the age limit at 16 with no exceptions has been passed by the Courts of Justice Committee and now is pending before the full Senate. Our ruling Vogel said that in Virginia, "people are going and getting marriage licenses who are 12 and 13, and 14 and 15 years old." There’s no dispute that there are children 13 to 15 who have gotten married. But the 12-year-olds are another story. Vogel relied on Department of Health information to say that 12-year-olds are getting married. That data, the department now says, is incorrect due to a database flaw. Bottom line: There are no records of 12-year-olds getting married from 2004 to 2014. We don’t fault Vogel for that glitch. Still, her statement requires a clarification. So we rate Vogel’s claim Mostly True. Editor's Note: This post has been updated to make clear that circuit court clerks are the ones that issue marriage licenses for minors under 16.

pomt-03727	"In Rhode Island, 28 percent of adults released from state prisons are re-incarcerated within a year."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/apr/15/ban-the-box-ri/video-says-28-percent-adults-released-rhode-island/	Rhode Island lawmakers recently heard testimony on a bill that would prohibit employers from asking job applicants if they have ever been convicted of a crime. The so-called "ban-the-box" legislation would bar employers from asking about a conviction history until "after making a conditional offer of employment" or "determining that an applicant is a finalist." Advocates for the bill, calling themselves Ban the Box RI, posted a six-minute film on YouTube supporting the legislation. It includes people who are identified only by their first names talking about how they had difficulty finding jobs after serving time in prison. State legislators and other officials who sponsored or support the proposal also make appearances. And A.T. Wall, the director of the Rhode Island Department of Corrections, appears and speaks in the film, although he told The Providence Journal after the film was released that he has taken no position on the bill. In the film, Wall describes what prisoners need to succeed when they re-enter society, noting the most important is employment. As he is speaking, a written statement appears on screen: "In Rhode Island, 28 percent of adults released from state prisons are re-incarcerated within a year." We wanted to see if that figure is accurate. Emmett FitzGerald, who helped make the movie, referred us to a Department of Corrections annual report. The department’s 2012 annual population report states that 3,387 offenders were released in calendar year 2009, a release group whose post-release statistics are being compiled over three years. "Within 1 year of release 28% of offenders returned to RIDOC with a new sentence," the report says. PolitiFact Rhode Island also checked directly with the Department of Corrections to verify the number. Susan Lamkins, programming services officer, responded with a January 2013 document that said 31 percent of offenders released in 2009 returned to the state prisons under a new sentence within one year of release. Lamkins explained the difference in an e-mail: "Due to a slight change in methodology these numbers were updated in January to reflect the correct return rate percentage." Whichever percentage one uses, both include parole and probation violators. The figures do not account for offenders who were released and later arrested on a new charge but were still awaiting trial. The Department of Corrections also provided in its report some comparison rates from four other New England states, but they were for different, and longer, periods after initial release from prison. Connecticut, for instance, had a 47-percent rate of offenders returning to prison within two years of release. (In Rhode Island, 42 percent returned to prison within 24 months of initially being released.) Other figures the Department of Corrections report cited were 43 percent for Massachusetts, 44.2 percent for New Hampshire and 52 percent for Vermont, but those were return-to-prison rates within three years of release. Rhode Island did not publish a three-year statistic. Year-three rates for the 2009 release group are slated to be published in the early summer, according to Lamkins. Our ruling The group Ban the Box RI, in its video says that "in Rhode Island, 28 percent of adults released from state prisons are re-incarcerated within a year." That was an accurate citation of a Department of Corrections figure at the time. The figure was revised to 31 percent -- close enough for us to rule True.

pomt-11106	"Ohio's (payday lending) laws are now the worst in the nation. Things have gotten so bad that it is legal to charge 594 percent interest on loans."	true	/ohio/statements/2018/jun/08/richard-cordray/richard-cordray-says-ohio-payday-lending-law-worst/	Though consumer advocates have long called for changing the payday lending law in Ohio, a criminal investigation has resulted in the resignation of the state House speaker. Republican Cliff Rosenberger resigned in April as the FBI was investigating his foreign travel sponsored by payday-lending lobbyists. He denied wrongdoing. Rosenberger’s resignation brought votes on legislation screeching to a halt, including a proposed bill to strengthen consumer protections for payday loans. Consumer advocates are collecting signatures to put similar language before voters on the ballot, likely in 2019. The Ohio Consumer Lenders Association, which represents the industry, opposes the measures. Richard Cordray, the Democrat running for governor against Republican Mike DeWine, has criticized the state law. "The current shutdown of the State House has delayed legislation addressing payday lending, where Ohio's laws are now the worst in the nation," Cordray tweeted May 17. "Things have gotten so bad that it is legal to charge 594 percent interest on loans that end up ruining people’s lives. Unconscionable." Cordray’s statement comparing Ohio’s payday industry to the nation comes from a 2014 report by Pew Charitable Trusts. Cordray worked on changing rules on payday lending on a national level when he was the first director of the federal Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. The bureau finalized rules on payday lending in October 2017, several weeks before he resigned to run for governor. Cordray has attacked his successor, Mick Mulvaney, for attempting to roll back the rules. Ohio’s payday lending law Payday loans are small, short-term loans that borrowers promise to repay out of their next paycheck at a high rate of interest. About three dozen states have their own payday laws, including Ohio. Proponents argue that the working poor need payday loans to cover their bills, while opponents argue that they trap borrowers in a cycle of debt. About one in 10 adults in Ohio have taken out a payday loan. In 2008, Ohio lawmakers approved the Short Term Loan Act. The law, opposed by the industry, included protections for borrowers, such as capping the loan at $500 and the annual interest rates for payday loans at 28 percent. However, payday lenders found a loophole: They registered as mortgage lenders instead. The Ohio Supreme Court upheld the law in 2014, prompting one concurring judge to ask, "Were the lobbyists smarter than the legislators? Did the legislators realize that the bill was smoke and mirrors and would accomplish nothing?" Ohio is the only state where lenders operate under such a statute that was not intended for payday loans, said Alex Horowitz, senior research officer for Pew Charitable Trust's consumer finance project, which has researched payday laws in the states for many years. In a 2014 analysis of states’ payday lending laws, Pew didn’t flat-out label Ohio as the worst in the nation for payday lending. But it did find that borrowers were charged much more than their peers in many other states. By examining payday loan prices in each state from the four largest lenders, Pew found that over five months a $300 payday loan would cost an Ohio borrower $680 in interest and fees, which equals an average annual percentage rate of 591 percent (which is close to the 594 percent figure cited by Cordray.) No other state had a higher rate, according to the Pew analysis. The interest and fees amount in Ohio was slightly exceeded by Texas, but Texas has more protections for consumers, including a 180-day loan limit that Ohio doesn’t have. While the typical loan is technically two weeks, in the majority of cases the borrower ends up in a cycle of loans for several months. While most states that allow payday lending cap loans at $500, Ohio lenders don’t operate under the Short Term Loan Act, so they can make loans that are double or even triple the amount of conventional payday loans. The Center for Responsible Lending, an organization that calls for more safeguards for consumers, found in 2015 that payday loan storefronts in Ohio advertised rates of more than 600 percent annual percentage rate. Diane Standaert, director of state policy, said that since that time some storefronts now reflect rates between 300 and 400 percent for some loans. "But this is basically comparing the differences between (1) a very bad loan, and (2) another very bad loan," she said. The effort to change Ohio’s payday lending law gained steam in March 2017 when House Bill 123 was introduced by State Reps. Kyle Koehler, a Republican of Springfield, and Michael Ashford, a Toledo Democrat. The bill is similar to Colorado’s payday lending law which consumer advocates have upheld as a model example. After languishing for a year, it passed a House committee in April 2018 about a week after Rosenberger resigned, but a full vote was placed on hold while lawmakers deadlocked over picking a new speaker. On June 7, the House passed the bill and it now heads to the Senate. The bill would cap the interest rate at 28 percent and a fee of up to $20 a month, which would mean that a borrower of $300 would pay $96 in interest and fees. Our ruling Cordray said, "Ohio's (payday lending) laws are now the worst in the nation. Things have gotten so bad that it is legal to charge 594 percent interest on loans." Pew Charitable Trusts found in 2014 that over five months a $300 payday loan would cost an Ohio borrower $680 in interest and fees, which equals an average annual percentage rate of 591 percent. While the report didn’t call out Ohio as the "worst in the nation," no other state had a rate that was higher, according to the report. The difference between the 591 percent cited in the report and the 594 percent tweeted by Cordray is negligible. We rate this statement True.

pomt-04378	Says Mitt Romney and George Allen "would overturn Roe v. Wade and allow states to end safe, legal abortion even in cases of rape, incest or when a woman's life is at risk."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/19/planned-parenthood/planned-parenthood-says-mitt-romney-and-george-all/	Abortion rights are at risk state by state with Republicans in charge, according to a new mailing from a super PAC affiliated with Planned Parenthood. The mailer, which targets female voters in Richmond and Northern Virginia, says presidential candidate Mitt Romney and U.S. Senate candidate George Allen would "overturn Roe v. Wade." That would "allow states to end safe, legal abortion even in cases of rape, incest or when a woman's life is at risk," the ad says. Romney and Allen have both gone on record as opposed to abortion except in cases of rape, incest and when necessary to save the mother’s life. But this mailer didn’t claim they opposed abortion in all cases. Instead, it said the end of Roe vs. Wade would allow states to pass such blanket bans. Justices ruled in the 1973 case that a woman has a qualified constitutional right to terminate her pregnancy. Nearly 40 years later, that means states can’t enforce laws that represent an "undue burden" on women seeking an abortion. We wondered, would Romney and Allen overturn Roe vs. Wade? And would that allow states to end abortion? Romney and Allen on ‘Roe’ First we’ve got to state the obvious: neither a president nor a senator can overturn a Supreme Court decision. But a president could appoint a justice interested in revisiting the issues raised in Roe, and a senator could vote to confirm such an nominee. (The New York Times and Atlantic, among others, have written about the 2012 election’s possible effect on the makeup of the court.) If a spot opened on the aging court, does that reflect what Romney and Allen have said they would do? Essentially, yes. Romney’s ever-shifting stances on abortion can be tough to pin down — the same week this mailer emerged, he said there wasn’t any antiabortion legislation on his agenda, then his spokeswoman said that of course he would support such legislation. (And when he ran for office in liberal Massachusetts, he said he supported a "woman's right to choose.") But on the question of Roe vs. Wade, his campaign website is clear. He wants it overturned: "Mitt believes that life begins at conception and wishes that the laws of our nation reflected that view. But while the nation remains so divided, he believes that the right next step is for the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade – a case of blatant judicial activism that took a decision that should be left to the people and placed it in the hands of unelected judges. With Roe overturned, states will be empowered through the democratic process to determine their own abortion laws and not have them dictated by judicial mandate." He also said on Meet the Press on Sept. 9, 2012, that he would "appoint justices for the Supreme Court that will follow the law and the constitution. And it would be my preference that they reverse Roe v. Wade and therefore they return to the people and their elected representatives the decisions with regards to this important issue." Now, Allen. His website says his "commitment to protecting innocent human life is firm" and that he opposes abortion "except in the rare cases where the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest, and when necessary to save the life of the mother." It doesn’t mention Roe vs. Wade. Planned Parenthood pointed us to his 2003 vote against the Harkin Amendment, which asked U.S. senators to affirm that the decision "should not be overturned." Meanwhile, his website argues that "his record on life issues is strong," noting that it earned him a 100 percent rating from the National Right to Life Committee when he was in the Senate, among other accomplishments. Allen’s campaign didn’t respond to our request to confirm whether he’s interested in an overturn of Roe, but the evidence is strong he would vote to confirm an anti-Roe nominee for the court if given the opportunity. A new Supreme Court justice Still, there’s no guarantee Romney would have a chance to replace a justice who supports Roe. Justices Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg are in their 70s, but wouldn’t voluntarily step aside under a Republican president, say court-watchers such as ScotusBlog publisher Tom Goldstein and CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. There’s no guarantee that Allen would be part of a Senate majority that would vote to confirm an anti-Roe justice. The chamber is up for grabs in the election, with more than 50 seats needed for a majority. We can say a win for Allen would put Republicans closer to overtaking the Senate: Virginia, a tossup state, is voting to replace retiring Democrat Jim Webb. There’s also no guarantee a newly reshuffled court would push to fully overturn Roe, returning the issue to states — though there’s no shortage of predictions it would, including from Toobin. But even the current court’s take on Roe vs. Wade hasn’t been well tested. "We don't know enough, because we haven't had much in the way of abortion cases since (Chief Justice John) Roberts and (Samuel) Alito joined the court," said Goldstein, who has argued 25 cases before the court. "... We don't know if the court is currently ready or would be ready with one more vote to overturn it." More likely, perhaps, would be a reinterpretation of "undue burden" that was far more narrow, allowing a wider range of state restrictions on abortion. States after ‘Roe’ But let’s assume, for the sake of argument, Romney gets to nominate an anti-Roe justice, Allen votes along with a majority of fellow senators to confirm that nomination, and a more conservative court picks a case that allows it to completely overturn Roe vs. Wade. Would that "allow states to end safe, legal abortion even in cases of rape, incest or when a woman's life is at risk"? Well, yes, but that’s unlikely to be the most common result. New limits on abortion, however, would be likely. The Center for Reproductive Rights found in 2004 that 30 states "were poised to criminalize abortion soon after a Roe reversal." The Guttmacher Institute, which works to "advance sexual and reproductive health and rights," keeps an updated fact-sheet called, "Abortion Policy in the Absence of Roe." This month, it showed that 20 states already have laws that could be used to restrict the legal status of abortion, from those that automatically ban abortion if Roe were overturned to laws that express intent to restrict the right to legal abortion "to the maximum extent permitted" by the court. But seven states have laws that protect the right to choose abortion "prior to viability or when necessary to protect the life or health of the woman." "A categorical ban, I think, would be quite rare," Goldstein said. Still, an overturned Roe would theoretically "allow" states to ban abortion without exceptions for rape, incest or the life of the mother, as the Planned Parenthood ad claims — whether they actually implemented such laws or not. So, let’s reprise the "ifs": • If Romney and Allen win and • If Romney gets the chance to replace a liberal justice and • If Allen and other senators confirm a justice who supports overturning Roe and • If that new justice creates a majority on the court willing to revisit Roe and • If there’s an appropriate case for the Supreme Court to review and • If the court decides to fully overturn Roe, returning abortion regulations to the states Then a state legislature could vote to "end safe, legal abortion even in cases of rape, incest or when a woman's life is at risk." Our ruling A Planned Parenthood mailer in Virginia claims that "(Mitt) Romney and (George) Allen would overturn Roe v. Wade and allow states to end safe, legal abortion even in cases of rape, incest or when a woman's life is at risk." A president and a senator don’t have the power to directly overturn a Supreme Court decision, but they could nominate and vote for an anti-Roe justice if a spot opened. Meanwhile, there’s no guarantee that a reshuffled court would fully overturn the decision, as opposed to further limiting a woman’s right to choose, but preserving protection in cases of rape, incest or risk to a woman's life. The ad says Romney and Allen "would." We suppose they would if they could — but whether they could is substantially more speculative than the ad suggests. We rate the ad’s claim Half True.

pomt-02009	"Right now, America has $1.1 trillion of student debt. That’s more than credit card debt."	true	/virginia/statements/2014/jun/10/mark-warner/warner-says-us-student-debt-has-surpassed-credit-c/	Sen. Mark Warner’s re-election stump speech dwells on giving everyone an equal opportunity and high on that list is an affordable college education. Warner and many of his fellow Democrats have called for legislation that would ease student debt by allowing students to refinance their federal college loans at substantially lower interest rates and limit their loan repayments to 10 percent of their annual income. President Barack Obama endorsed those measures during a speech Monday.. Warner, during a recent speech of his own, said, "Right now, America has $1.1 trillion of student debt. That’s more than credit card debt." This statistic caught our attention, so we put it to the Truth-O-Meter. David Turner, spokesman for Warner’s campaign, backed up the statement by sending us a speech by an official at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and data from the Federal Reserve System. Both of those sources say that student debt has topped $1 trillion and the speech noted that it had surpassed credit cards. But the best data comes from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which publishes debt statistics every quarter. In the most recent report, covering first three months of 2014, student loan debt totaled $1.1 trillion, while credit card debt hit $659 billion. The largest type of debt for Americans is mortgages, which came in at $8.2 trillion in the first quarter. Student loan debt is No. 2, followed by automobile loans at $875 billion and credit card debt in making up $11.7 trillion in all debt. Student debt began to outpace credit card debt in the second quarter of 2010, when college loans hit $762 billion. Student debt topped the $1 trillion mark in the third quarter of last year. Average tuition across the nation increased 79.5 percent from 2003-2013, according to data from the U.S. Labor Department. For comparison, the Consumer Price Index grew by 26.7 percent during the same span and average wages grew by 30.1 percent. Credit card debt, by contrast, has gradually fallen from $843 billion in early 2009 to its $659 billion level this year. Much of the decrease occurred during the recession when people cut back on spending. But the recession exacerbated college debts, according to Caroline Ratcliffe, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. She cited two reasons: Tuition was rising far faster the income; Demand for college education increased. "You have to remember that during the time of the Great Recession, more people were going back to school because of the job situation, so they were taking on more debt," she said. A study she co-wrote tackled the demographics of people with student loan debt. It found that student loan debt, for those ages 29 to 37, had increased by $10,381 on average from 1989 to 2010, while car loans had increased $302, credit card debt had increased $1,215 and other debt had decreased $2,078. In 2012, 40 percent of Americans in their 20s had student debt, 30 percent in their 30s owed on student loans, 19 percent of Americans in their 40s, 12 percent in their 50s and 4 percent in their 60s. This included students and parents who borrowed to send their children to college. Our ruling Warner said, "Right now, America has $1.1 trillion of student debt. That’s more than credit card debt." His figure on student debt is accurate and total U.S. credit card debt in the first quarter of this year was $659 billion. We rate Warner’s statement True.

pomt-06200	Suzanne Bonamici votes with her party a partisan 98 percent of the time.	half-true	/oregon/statements/2011/dec/09/rob-cornilles/does-suzanne-bonamici-vote-partisan-98-percent-tim/	Both major party candidates in the Jan. 31 election for the 1st Congressional District want voters to think they are independent, bipartisan, above party-line bickering. So it’s no surprise that Republican Rob Cornilles and his supporters like to say that former Democratic state Sen. Suzanne Bonamici "votes 98 percent of the time" with her caucus. He said that the day after winning the special primary election. And he said it again at a recent debate. "She has talked about separating herself from her party but the reality is she votes 98 percent of the time with the Democrats in Salem. I don’t know how that represents bipartisanship; that represents to me more of the same," he said. (And in a follow-up press release.) Allen Alley, chairman of the Oregon Republican Party, repeated the sentiment in a Nov. 15 press release: "Bonamici's narrow world and economic view explains why she's voted in the Oregon legislature with her party 98 percent of the time," he said. Bonamici’s campaign pleaded with PolitiFact Oregon to provide context for the claim. After all, legislators take many votes that are routine, so Democrats and Republicans end up voting the same way more often than you’d think. Game on, we said. Mary Anne Ostrom, Cornilles’ campaign manager, said the 98 percent figure comes from The Oregonian’s "Your Government" website. The O’s web designer and developer Mark Friesen set up the site so readers can see how legislators voted on a bill, and how often they voted with their party. The 2011 Oregon Senate was split 16-14, with Democrats in the majority. The Senate took about 950 floor votes. It’s true that, according to our website, Bonamici voted with her party 98 percent of the time -- but voting with your party 98 percent of the time doesn’t mean you necessarily voted against the other party. We asked Friesen to check Bonamici’s votes against three Republicans in the Senate: Minority Leader Ted Ferrioli of John Day; Jackie Winters of Salem; and Bruce Starr of Hillsboro. Winters is a fierce advocate of social services and Starr is a leader on transportation issues. All three are considered solid Republicans. Bonamici voted the same way as Winters 89.6 percent of the time; with Ferrioli, 76 percent; and with Starr, 73 percent. In other words, she and a Republican voted the same way anywhere from 73 percent to nearly 90 percent of the time. (During the 2010 special session, she voted with Winters 87 percent of the time and in 2009, 77 percent of the the time, for an overall average of 83 percent from 2009-11.) In our view, that makes Bonamici more than a "button-pushing" partisan. We went a step further, just to see how she sides with Democrats on narrower votes. We took a database of 2011 session votes provided by Bonamici’s campaign and winnowed the list down to 106 votes that were lopsided -- 20 votes out of 30 -- or where Bonamici voted no. Here’s what we found: She voted with her party in roughly 91 instances where the issue fell along party lines. For example, she approved a bill to increase driver fees, and she joined other Democrats in voting against legislation favoring online charter schools. Bonamici also voted to change the kicker "refund check" into a kicker "credit" and she voted in favor of expanding Oregon’s Bottle Bill. Those are all positions taken by the majority of her party. In some 15 instances, she was among the no votes, sometimes joining with other Democrats or with Democrats and Republicans. For example, she voted against compromise legislation creating a health exchange. But we don’t see her siding with Republicans against her party. We need to add a crucial bit of information, since Cornilles brings up bipartisanship. Bonamici was chairwoman of the Senate Redistricting Committee and successfully helped negotiate a redistricting agreement with a split House. Lawmakers failed to do that in 2001 or in 1991; redistricting occurs every 10 years. Where does that leave us? Well, we know that the methodology relied on by the Cornilles campaign is incomplete because it ignores votes that are unanimous or near unanimous. Also, Bonamici was one of the legislators charged with creating a bipartisan redistricting map, and by most accounts she did splendidly. So it’s not accurate to say she lacks bipartisanship skills. On the other hand, we find that she usually votes with her party on significant issues. Based on the evidence, we rate the statement Half True because he ignores her bipartisan work and because he fails to acknowledge how often she votes with Republicans. The statement is partially accurate, but missing important details. Go back to OregonLive to comment.	None	Rob Cornilles	None	None	None	2011-12-09T21:00:00	2011-11-27	['None']
pomt-12606	"Apprehension rates at the southern border have plummeted since the 1980s, and apprehensions of Mexicans specifically have reached their lowest point in nearly half a century."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/03/john-conyers/apprehensions/	Democratic congressman John Conyers Jr. urged his colleagues during a recent hearing on immigration to examine measures rooted in fact. One of those facts, he said, is that the southern border is more secure than ever. "Apprehension rates at the southern border have plummeted since the 1980s, and apprehensions of Mexicans specifically have reached their lowest point in nearly half a century," Conyers, a Michigan representative, said March 28. We know that apprehension rates have been down in recent months. President Donald Trump has taken credit for recent declines in southwest border apprehensions. But is Conyers right that rates have plummeted since the 1980s, and that the number of Mexicans apprehended is at the lowest in nearly 50 years? Border patrol data and research from an independent think tank back up Conyers’ claim. Overall apprehension numbers since the 1980s Apprehension data is commonly regarded as a measure of illegal immigration. When apprehensions are up, it’s often thought that more people have been trying to cross the border. However, apprehensions represent events, not individuals. For example, one immigrant may have been apprehended multiple times and all those instances are added to the totals. Border patrol made 408,870 apprehensions at the southwest border in fiscal year 2016, and while that was an increase from 2015, it’s still a fraction of the number of apprehensions routinely observed from the 1980s through 2008, said a December 2016 statement from the Department of Homeland Security. The recession of 2008 is likely to blame for the drop-off that started that year. Conyers' team pointed to that statement and to historical data on apprehensions at the southwest border, specifically years 1986 and 2016. In 1986 there were 1.6 million apprehensions – about 1.2 million more than in 2016. But it’s worth noting that there hasn’t been a steady decline since the 1980s. There have been increases and decreases over the years. During the 1980s, there was an average of 1 million border patrol apprehensions at the southwest border a year. During the Obama administration, the average was below 500,000. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Apprehensions of Mexicans at the southwest border The second part of Conyers’ claim was specifically about Mexican immigrants. He said their apprehension levels have reached their lowest point in nearly half a century, basing his statement on an April 2016 analysis by Pew Research Center. Pew found that in 2015, border patrol conducted 188,122 apprehensions of Mexican nationals, the lowest since 1969, when 159,376 Mexicans were apprehended. "The decline suggests unauthorized immigration flows from Mexico could be falling," Pew research reported. Some reasons for declines in Mexican immigrants during and since the Great Recession according to Pew are: fewer jobs available, particularly in construction; stricter enforcement of immigration laws; and demographic changes in Mexico with decreases in the age of immigrants more likely to migrate. (In 2014, about 25 percent of the population was between 15 and 29 years old. In 1990, that segment was above 29 percent.) DHS also has noted shifts in the demographics of people attempting to cross the border illegally. Over the past 15 years, far fewer Mexicans and single adults are trying to cross illegally, the DHS noted in its December 2016 statement. But more families and children are being stopped at the border as they flee poverty and violence in Central America. In 2014 and 2016, the number of Central Americans apprehended at the southern border outnumbered the number of Mexicans, DHS said.

pomt-07223	"We have seized more currency, more drugs, more outbound arms in the past year than any year in our country’s history."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/jun/03/janet-napolitano/homeland-security-chief-says-more-contraband-being/	As members of the Obama administration push for immigration reform, they’re casting themselves as border security hawks. President Barack Obama said he has "gone above and beyond" what Republicans requested for border patrol. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, a former governor of Arizona, was even more emphatic during a May talk at the Atlanta Press Club. She said "there has never been a larger, more sustained and better effort" on the border than today. "We have seized more currency, more drugs, more outbound arms in the past year than any year in our country’s history," Napolitano said. Has the country’s haul of contraband really reached such historic highs? We asked the Department of Homeland Security for proof. It gave us statistics for seizures by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Immigration Customs Enforcement that compared two-and-a-half years under Obama and the last two-and-a-half years under President George W. Bush. According to the data for the U.S.-Mexico border: * Illegal currency seizures grew by about 75 percent from $124.5 million to $218.7 million. * Illegal drug seizures grew 31 percent, from 3.2 million kilos to 4.2 million kilos. * Illegal weapons seizures grew 64 percent from about 3,100 to 5,200. We asked for more data, but despite more than two weeks of requests, DHS did not give us additional information. So we turned to other sources. In October 2010, the Government Accountability Office, the nonpartisan investigative arm of the U.S. Congress, issued a report on the federal government’s effort to stop cross-border currency smuggling. Data show that cash seizures jumped after the March 2009 start of a program to boost seizures of outbound money and drugs. During the first year of that program, Customs and Border Protection seized about $34 million heading out of the country on land, overwhelmingly from the southwest border. The agency seized $16.8 million in the year leading up to it. The cash seizures, however, varied widely from about $1 million to $8 million per month and likely account for only a fraction of the money that crosses the borders. An estimated $18 billion to $39 billion is smuggled out of the southwest border each year, according to the GAO report. Marijuana drug seizures increased almost 50 percent from 1.6 million pounds in fiscal year 2008 to 2.4 million pounds in fiscal year 2010, according to a separate March 2011 GAO report. We were unable to find similar firearms figures. Further complicating the issue is that as of fiscal year 2011, Customs and Border Protection no longer reports data on its success detecting contraband, according to the March 2011 report. Experts on counternarcotics told us they have no reason to doubt Napolitano’s claim. In recent years, the DHS has doubled the number of border patrol agents, installed technology that makes it easier to detect contraband and paid more attention to coordinating their efforts with Mexico. Improving the border effort, however, did not require an exceptional effort, experts told us. Previously, there was little emphasis on seizing illegal guns, noted Vanda Felbab-Brown, a fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. "Yes, we are capturing more arms than ever because we now try for the first time; the baselines are extremely low," Felbab-Brown wrote PolitiFact Georgia in an email. It’s also important to note that these increases in seizures are not proof DHS’ efforts are successful, said Eric L. Olson, a counternarcotics expert at the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. He said we need to know what percentage of contraband is being captured. If DHS drug seizures climbed 10 percent, but 100 percent more drugs are being smuggled across the border, that’s hardly a success. "They’re doing more things," Olson said of the DHS, "but whether it is accomplishing anything is another question." That’s a question we may be unable to answer, he added. It’s extremely difficult to calculate the total amount of drugs entering the country. To sum up: The data DHS gave us is not enough to prove definitively that Napolitano’s claim that the agency has "seized more currency, more drugs, more outbound arms in the past year than any year in our country’s history." We can say that seizures increased recently under the Obama administration, but they were so low in the past that the bump is not a major accomplishment. Also, the seized contraband is likely such a small percentage of what crosses the border that the increase’s impact on the illegal drug trade is slight. By PolitiFact’s rules, the burden of proof is on the person who makes the claim. Since the Department of Homeland Security did not provide us with enough data to support her talking point, and the increase in seizures is not a clear-cut sign of border security success, we rate her claim Half True.

pomt-03947	Says Austin is the largest city in the U.S. without nonstop flights to Europe.	false	/texas/statements/2013/feb/19/pete-winstead/pete-winstead-says-austin-largest-us-city-without-/	Austin lawyer Pete Winstead is negotiating with European airlines to start nonstop service from Austin, according to a Feb. 6, 2013, news story by KUT News in Austin. The story reported that Winstead said Austin is the largest city in the U.S. without "direct flights" to Europe. Stopping along the way increases chances for delays that could cause a business executive to miss a meeting, Winstead said. "Nonstop air service, even if it leaves Austin 30 minutes late, is not a big problem," he told KUT. Not that PolitiFact Texas is planning any European vacations, but we decided to check the departure boards. Do the United States’ biggest cities all have a nonstop option Austinites don’t? Austin passed San Francisco last year to become the 13th largest U.S. city, according to the most recent Census Bureau news. The Top 12: New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Diego, Dallas, San Jose, Jacksonville and Indianapolis. Austin-Bergstrom International Airport spokesman Jim Halbrook told us by phone that no carriers have a nonstop passenger flight from Austin to Europe. Eight of the nine largest cities have nonstop flights to Europe. Sample itinerary: If you depart Dallas/Fort Worth International on American Airlines at 5 p.m, you can be in Paris nine hours and 40 minutes later. Hop a British Airways plane in San Diego at 10:10 p.m. and you’ll be at London’s Heathrow Airport in 10 hours and 25 minutes. San Antonio ranks seventh by size, and although San Antonio International Airport has nonstop flights to Mexico, spokeswoman Nora Castro told us by phone that it has no nonstops to Europe. Spokespeople for the San Jose, Jacksonville and Indianapolis airports told us by phone that they do not have nonstop flights to Europe. All but Jacksonville have international nonstops -- San Jose to Tokyo, Austin to Cancún, etc. -- but none go to Europe. For a table showing all 13 cities and giving specific destinations, click here. We also checked to see how the claim holds up if we go beyond the city limits and compare the greater Austin area to other metro areas. According to the Census Bureau, in 2011 the Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos area ranked 34th among the country's biggest metropolitan statistical areas, with nearly 1.8 million residents. Both the San Antonio and San Jose regions were larger, so Austin’s not the biggest metro area with no Europe nonstop flight, either. Our ruling Winstead said Austin was the largest U.S. city without a nonstop flight to Europe. But four larger cities lack such flights, making this statement False.

pomt-08531	On protecting Social Security benefits and changing the retirement age.	full flop	/ohio/statements/2010/oct/04/bob-gibbs/gibbs-website-public-statements-vary-social-securi/	On his campaign website, GOP Congressional candidate Bob Gibbs says he’s committed to retaining Social Security benefits for seniors and future retirees. "We need to ensure that benefits are protected and that taxes and the retirement age are not increased," the website says. "We have a responsibility and a commitment to seniors to fund our obligation to them and not place the system in jeopardy by moving away from the current program to privatization of the system." But Gibbs expressed a different view on the Social Security retirement age at a July 12 forum for congressional candidates sponsored by the Eastern Ohio Development Alliance that was videotaped by backers of the congressman he wants to replace, Dover Democrat Zack Space. An audience member asked whether Gibbs agreed with House GOP Leader John Boehner’s stance that the Social Security retirement age should be raised to 70. Instead of citing his website’s position, Gibbs applauded Boehner’s leadership and said the nation needs to seriously discuss how to make entitlement programs actuarially sound. "Our younger folks in their 20s and 30s, they think their retirement age is going to move up, I think they expect that," said Gibbs. "We’re living longer, our life expectancies are going up, and you just can’t have an actuarially sound system if you don’t make these changes or you’re not going to have a system at all." That struck us as a complete reversal of his previous position -- a Full Flop. Then at a Sept. 18 debate in Mount Vernon between Gibbs and Constitution Party candidate Lindsay Sutton, Gibbs suggested forming a bipartisan task force to ensure Social Security’s viability, and went on to say: "I doubt I would have supported it back in the 1930’s when they did it, but we have it now and we’ve got to fulfill our obligations." The remark that he might have opposed creation of Social Security prompted the Space campaign to denounce Gibbs. "Bob Gibbs’ complete hostility toward this crucial program is just plain shameless," Space spokesman Andrew Ricci said in a news release. We asked for Gibbs’ true stance on Social Security in light of his public comments. His spokeswoman, Emily Pettigrew, replied with this email: "You can pull a clip here and a clip there and make it sound like anything, the fact is that Bob Gibbs stands firm that we should not raise the retirement age, we should not cut benefits, and we should not privatize Social Security." Pettigrew said efforts to highlight Gibbs’ remarks were just a "distraction tactic" "straight from Nancy Pelosi’s playbook of desperation." She accused Space of "trying to take the focus off of the double-digit unemployment in the district" under his watch. But Gibbs’ own words provide ample fodder for distraction. His remarks to the Eastern Ohio Developement Alliance clearly contradict his official campaign position that the Social Security retirement age should not be raised. His statement in the Mount Vernon debate suggests he would have opposed creation of Social Security in the first place. Then there’s the statement from his campaign to clarify his position, which clearly contradicts his remarks to the Eastern Ohio Development Alliance. That statement represents a Full Flop on the Full Flop. Ultimately, we end up back where we started. But given the gyrations taken with Gibbs’ public statements on Social Security, followed up by his campaign comment, he has earned high marks as a Flip-O-Meter gymnast. We award him a Full Flop.

pomt-13040	"In 2015 roughly 10,000 political arrests occurred in Cuba. That is five times as many as occurred in 2010, when there were only about 2,000."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/nov/29/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-political-arrests-cuba-have-increase/	The son of a Cuban immigrant, Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said that he hoped President-elect Donald Trump could press for change for Cubans following Fidel Castro’s death. But in a Nov. 27 interview on ABC’s This Week, Cruz expressed some skepticism that anything will be better under Castro’s brother Raúl Castro, who began taking over in 2006. "What the Obama administration has done is strengthen Raúl Castro. Raúl is the dictator now," Cruz said. "You know, I asked my dad at dinner last night, what do you think happens now that Fidel is dead? And he shrugged and said Raúl has been in power for years. The system has gotten stronger. ... You know, in 2015 roughly 10,000 political arrests occurred in Cuba. That is five times as many as occurred in 2010, when there were only about 2,000." We were interested in his statistic, so we contacted Cruz’s office. Spokesman Phil Novack told us the senator slightly misspoke, but his point is still basically accurate. Political arrests in Cuba Novack told PolitiFact Florida that Cruz meant to compare the number of political arrests in Cuba in 2010 to 2016 rather than 2015. Cruz’s primary source was the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation. Based in Havana, the commission is the island’s oldest and most respected non-government, human-rights monitoring group, according to the Miami Herald, a PolitiFact Florida partner. The commission reported 2,074 politically motivated detentions in 2010. That escalated to 8,600 in 2015 and then to 9,125 through October 2016. The commission predicts the number of political arrests "will exceed the level of 10,000 detentions" through the end of 2016. Experts on Cuba say the commission founded by Elizardo Sánchez has the most reliable source of data and sometimes use it in combination with other sources. That said, the data comes with caveats. "It's very hard to work with exact numbers in Cuba," said Pedro Alcántara, spokesman for the Foundation for Human Rights in Cuba, based in Miami. "Not only are we fighting very strong repression, but sometimes the data changes every day." The Cuban regime uses a revolving door for arresting political prisoners — most being held for hours or sometimes a couple of days and often facing violence while detained. In some cases, the prisoners are released without being charged. The commission has been able to report on short arrests, said Florida International University political science professor Eduardo Gamarra. "However, the accuracy of his data is also arguable since there is no 'official' acknowledgment that political prisoners exist in Cuba," he said. "Having said that, it is quite possible that the number of short-term arrests is higher or that it is quite lower." Some pro-regime groups criticize the list of the commission, alleging it contains multiple arrests of the same individuals within the same year. Carlos Ponce, director of Latin America programs at the watchdog group Freedom Press, said he doesn’t know if that is true or not since it is impossible to audit the list. The commission was founded by Elizardo Sánchez, a Cuban human rights campaigner. "But at the same time, the list only covers the cases reported to Elizardo's group, so you can say that there are many cases unreported," he said. There is some dispute about how to define political prisoners, raising questions of overcounting. In 2010, for example, the Associated Press vetted a list of 167 political prisoners by the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation. About 50 people on the list "were convicted of terrorism, hijacking or other violent crimes, and four are former military or intelligence agents convicted of espionage or revealing state secrets," according to the AP. Why arrests have increased While settling on a precise figure of political arrests each year is a daunting task, experts agreed that in general the numbers have risen since 2010. Obama’s announcement in 2014 that the United States would reopen ties with Cuba did not lead to less political repression on the island. Sánchez, the creator of the commission’s list, told Miami Herald columnist Andrés Oppenheimer in July that that the civil and political rights situation had worsened over the past year. "In terms of (Cuba’s) domestic politics, the reestablishment of ties hasn’t had any positive impact," he said. More Cubans feel emboldened to express their discontent with the regime, even as the government sends more dissenters behind bars, said Marselha Gonçalves Margerin, advocacy director for the Americas at Amnesty International, a group that was last allowed into Cuba in 1989. Unless the criminal code is changed, which is unlikely to happen any time soon, the strengthened crackdown will continue, she said. "We are seeing people going out on the streets that didn’t go before," she told PolitiFact Florida. Sebastian A. Arcos, associate director of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University, said there was a shift in the Castro regime from targeted, long-term, politically motivated imprisonment to more frequent and often violent short-term detentions lasting from hours to days. "The obvious goal is to avoid the international condemnation that follows long-term political prisoners, and to prevent dissident public activities to escalate into larger demonstration," Arcos said. "As they say, the revolution cannot afford to lose the streets." Our ruling Cruz said, "In 2015 roughly 10,000 political arrests occurred in Cuba. That is five times as many as occurred in 2010, when there were only about 2,000." Cruz’s point about the rise of political arrests happening amid improved diplomacy with the United States is basically right. He would have been on more precise ground had he referred to 2016 and not 2015, as a spokesman said he intended to do. And while the source of his figures is widely considered to be reliable, experts said it is hard to track and label every arrest for political reasons. Because his point requires additional explanation but is largely accurate, we rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/94293748-11b2-474a-82f0-7754db784836	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2016-11-29T11:53:40	2016-11-27	['Cuba']
pomt-01744	The United States is at "historic record highs" of individuals being apprehended on the border from countries with terrorist ties such as "Pakistan or Afghanistan or Syria."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/03/rick-perry/rick-perry-historic-record-highs-people-terrorists/	Texas Gov. Rick Perry says the border needs more protection against a record-high number of illegal immigrants coming from terrorist havens, but the figures don’t match Perry’s rhetoric. With Congress scrambling to address illegal immigration before the start of their summer recess this past Friday, it’s no surprise that the issue was a main topic on the Aug. 3, 2014, talk shows. Perry, who is considering a 2016 presidential run, appeared on CNN’s State of the Union to talk about President Barack Obama’s response to the crisis in Israel and the situation along the U.S.-Mexico border. Perry defended his recent decision to ramp up state spending on border operations following a massive influx of children from Central American countries. "I'm the governor of the state of Texas. My citizens' safety is what is foremost here. And it hasn't got anything to do with anything other than those numbers of individuals who are coming across the border. And when you think about the idea that some of them are from countries that have substantial terrorist ties, whether it's Pakistan or Afghanistan or Syria, we are at historic record highs with individuals being apprehended from those countries," Perry said. The claim about illegal immigrants coming from countries with terrorist ties caught our attention. PolitiFact Texas checked two similar Perry claims in June. Perry said there was a record number of border apprehensions of people from countries other than Mexico, which PolitiFact Texas found to be True. But Perry also said of the surge in apprehensions, "These are people that are coming from states like Syria that have substantial connections back to terrorist regimes and terrorist operations." PolitiFact Texas found that less than 5 percent of the "other than Mexico" apprehensions in 2012 (the most recent available data) involved people from countries that the United States designates as terrorist states or safe havens. For that, PolitiFact Texas rated Perry’s claim Pants on Fire. Is it possible, though, that the small number of apprehensions of individuals from those countries in 2012 could be a record? By the numbers We asked Perry’s office for evidence, but they did not get back to us. We found the most recent and comprehensive breakdown of apprehensions by country and year in the Department of Homeland Security’s 2012 Yearbook of Immigration Statistics (table 34), released July 2013. The document has data from the past 10 years. Here are the number of apprehensions for Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria: Year Afghanistan Pakistan Syria 2003 61 4,083 369 2004 57 641 106 2005 55 792 113 2006 53 721 151 2007 28 654 101 2008* 74 654 101 2009 74 575 87 2010 88 592 95 2011 106 525 108 2012 95 458 56 *Note: Data from 2008 and on includes Immigration and Customs Enforcement enforcement and removal operations. Based on the DHS data, there were not record apprehensions in 2012 for individuals from the three countries Perry mentioned, nor are apprehensions trending up. In fact, 2012 was the lowest year out of these 10 for Pakistan and Syria. To cover our bases, we also looked the DHS yearbook’s data for about a dozen other countries designated by the State Department to be terrorist safe havens or state sponsors of terrorism. The list includes Afghanistan, Colombia, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen. We found that none of these countries had record highs in 2012. Afghanistan, Libya and Somalia hit their record in 2011, though there is no discernible upward trend. The numbers of apprehensions of individuals from these countries is also incredibly low compared to the primary sources of illegal immigrants. In 2012, DHS apprehended nearly 450,000 Mexicans, 55,000 Guatemalans and 50,000 Hondurans. In contrast, officials apprehended 95 Afghanis, 458 Pakistanis and 56 Syrians. Justification It’s important to note that while Perry was using this statement to justify bringing more resources to the Texas-Mexico border, an apprehension and other enforcement measures can happen at the border, in the country’s interior or at designated places outside of the United States, according to the DHS document. Historically, only an extremely small number of people from the Middle East or South Asia who try to enter the United States illegally do so by crossing a land border, said Stephen Kelly, former deputy chief of mission for the United States in both Mexico and Canada. "People from those areas are more likely to try to enter via an airport, perhaps with false documents," said Kelly, now a public policy professor at Duke University. And many people coming from these countries without a valid visa apply for asylum as soon as they enter the United States, so they are essentially turning themselves in. This has been an argument against increasing the number of border patrol agents in response to the influx of Central American children because they come to the country actively seeking officials rather than trying to evade them. This is because the current law, passed under former President George W. Bush to combat child trafficking, allows children from countries that don’t border the United States to stay in the country. Policymakers are now contemplating changing the law. Our ruling Perry said the United States is at "historic record highs" of individuals being apprehended on the border from countries with terrorist ties such as "Pakistan or Afghanistan or Syria." The most recent data does not show record apprehensions of individuals from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Syria or any other designated terrorist countries, nor does it show an upward trend in apprehensions of individuals from those areas. Even if it did, many apprehensions of people from these areas happen at airports rather than land borders. We rate Perry’s claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-12996	Says "tens of thousands of children" were rushed across the southwest border "because they fear the wall."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2016/dec/15/geraldo-rivera/mostly-false-claim-children-are-rushing-across-bor/	Fox News’ correspondent Geraldo Rivera said a wave of immigrants from Central America is hitting the United States ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. Thousands of children and families have been apprehended at the southwest border in recent years as they try to flee violence and poverty in Central America, particularly in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. More attention should be given to Central America’s economic and safety issues, Rivera said. But he said another concern is also driving immigration to the United States: Trump’s promised border wall. "You have a situation where you have all, tens of thousands of children being rushed across the border. Ironically ... why are they coming now? Why were there 45,000 last month as compared to a year ago?" Rivera asked during a Dec. 12 interview on Fox News’ Hannity. "They're coming because they fear the wall. They fear that the wall will start construction on Jan. 20, and they won’t be able to come and go the way they have been for decades." We were curious about his statement that tens of thousands of children were rushing across the border before Trump takes office and builds a wall. While many children are coming across the border, it’s not at the level Rivera said, and there are other factors motivating them to come to the United States. "I do not think that significant numbers of children are arriving at the border because they fear that the wall will hurt their future chances," said Denise Gilman, who directs the Immigration Clinic at the University of Texas School of Law. "I have personally spoken to many children and mothers who have arrived at the border and almost all are seeking refugee protection, in the form of asylum." Our requests to Rivera for more information about his data went unanswered. November 2016 apprehension data not yet available Border apprehension data is frequently used as a measure of illegal entry into the United States. Rivera mentioned "last month’s" border crossings, which we took as November, but the latest information available goes through October 2016, the first month of fiscal year 2017. Immigration authorities in October caught 46,195 individuals of all nationalities along the southwest border. However, just 6,754 were younger than 18 years old. A total of 5,451 children were from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, according to border patrol data. "Within these totals, we have seen corresponding increases in the numbers of unaccompanied children and individuals in families apprehended," Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said in a November statement. "We’ve also seen increases in the numbers of those who present themselves at ports of entry along the southwest border seeking asylum." Southwest border apprehensions of unaccompanied minors increased 37 percent in October 2016 compared to October 2015. Overall apprehensions increased 41 percent. The main takeaway for our assessment of Rivera’s statement: While overall apprehensions in October 2016 were up from the year before at around 46,000 people, the number of children caught is much smaller. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Reasons for Central American children crossing the border So there has been a year-over-year uptick in apprehensions along the southwest border. Why? An August 2016 Congressional Research Service report noted that gang-related violence, poverty and lack of educational and employment opportunities in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras played a key role in children’s decisions to leave their homes on their own and cross illegally into the United States. We could not find strong evidence to back up Rivera’s assertion that the election influenced their decision to come. Media reports published after the election included comments from the mayor of McAllen, Texas, Jim Darling, who said he believed talks about a wall being built along the border motivated immigrants to come sooner rather than later. "I’m sure that the discussion about a wall and getting tough on immigration was used by people down there to say, ‘Get up here now before it’s too late,’ " Darling, whose city borders Mexico, told the Washington Post. "If you talk to them, they all know about President Trump," Darling told CNN. "They all know about a wall. ... The cartels that are encouraging and making money off this travel, they go down and they exploit that." Darling told CNN he had spoken with recent arrivals. The CNN report, however, also said that Manuel Padilla Jr., chief patrol agent of the Rio Grande Valley Sector, has not noticed an election effect and cited violence and poverty as factors for immigration. Gilman, of the Texas School of Law immigration clinic, also said Central Americans are fleeing extreme violence in their countries. "I have never yet heard a single child or mother mention the wall as a factor in their decision to migrate or in the timing of their arrival," Gilman added. Children and families have not been crossing in great numbers for decades. That has been the case only in recent years, most notably in 2014 and driven by the violence in Central America, Gilman said. Many Central Americans turn themselves to immigration authorities in order to seek asylum protection; to apply, individuals must be physically present in the United States and can do so regardless of how they arrived or of their current immigration status. Immigration officials said that 2014 was the first time Central Americans apprehended on the southern border outnumbered Mexicans. "The demographics of illegal migration on our southern border has changed significantly over the last 15 years – far fewer Mexicans and single adults are attempting to cross the border without authorization, but more families and unaccompanied children are fleeing poverty and violence in Central America," Johnson, the Secretary of Homeland Security, said in an October statement. Back to Rivera’s comment, a month’s worth of data is also not sufficient to infer increases stem from fears about Trump’s administration policies, said Peter Margulies, who teaches immigration law and national security law at Roger Williams University School of Law. Immigration flows are influenced by many reasons, including conditions in immigrants’ native countries, Margulies said. Still, prospective immigrants care about how politics affects U.S. immigration policy, and smugglers "will try to exploit fear of President-elect Trump's immigration plans to encourage people to try to enter the U.S. sooner rather than later," Margulies said. Our ruling Speaking about children crossing the southwest border, Rivera said tens of thousands are coming now "because they fear the wall." About 46,000 people were apprehended at the southwest border in October 2016, the latest data available. But speaking specifically about all unaccompanied children crossing the border, the number is much lower, 6,754. It’s not likely, given the ongoing high levels of violence and poverty in Central American countries, that fears of the election were the primary motivation behind these crossings. The number of Central American unaccompanied children crossing the border increased before the election, peaking in 2014. One month’s worth of data and anecdotal evidence is insufficient to explain that increases stem from fears of a wall, though smugglers might try to exploit that fear to push people toward the United States. Rivera’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

"We spend $15-billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies," Sen. Barack Obama said. "It doesn’t – under the Medicare plan – it doesn’t help seniors get any better. It’s not improving our health care system. It’s just a giveaway." Obama used the same example when asked a similar question in the first debate. "We right now give $15-billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the Medicare system," Obama said. "Doesn’t work any better through the private insurers. They just skim off $15-billion. That was a giveaway and part of the reason is because lobbyists are able to shape how Medicare works." Obama is talking about the Medicare Advantage (MA) program, which pays private insurance companies a set rate to treat Medicare beneficiaries who sign up. It was conceived as a cost containment measure on the theory that competition between HMOs, PPOs and other private plans would drive down costs. In fact, MA plans have consistently cost the government more per beneficiary than traditional fee-for-service Medicare costs. About 18 percent of beneficiaries now belong to MA plans. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an independent Congressional agency, estimated that in 2008, the MA program cost 13 percent more than traditional Medicare. A Commonwealth Fund report estimates that that translates, on average, to nearly $1,000 more for each person in the MA program, for a national total of more than $8.5-billion last year (and a total $33-billion from 2004 to 2008). Insurance companies argue that people enrolled MA programs get better service. "One of the important things to keep in mind is that Medicare Advantage provides additional benefits and services not available in traditional fee-for-service programs," said Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for America’s Health Insurance Plans. Zirkelbach argues that the plan offers better hearing, vision and dental coverage and a disease management plan. MA plans have also proven useful in some rural areas that are short on health care providers. Some plans refund all, or part, of their clients' Part B Medicare premium, which can save people hundreds of dollars a year. The tradeoff is that beneficiaries are often limited to using hospitals and doctors in the plans' network. While beneficiaries' out-of-pocket costs are often less under MA plans, that is not always the case. Some services, like nursing home rehabilitation, can be more expensive than under traditional Medicare. Brian Biles, a professor in the Department of Health Policy at George Washington University and a former senior vice president of the Commonwealth Fund, said that while MA participants may get about 13 percent more value from extra benefits in the MA plan, it costs about 13 percent more. So it isn't necessarily any more efficient than traditional Medicare, just more costly, Biles argues. "Why should some people get an extra $1,000 in Medicare coverage and some not?" Biles said. In testimony before the House of Representatives on June 28, 2007, CBO director Peter R. Orszag said Medicare is, in effect, subsidizing the added cost of the Medicare Advantage program. But is it better? Orszag wasn’t convinced. "Many Medicare Advantage plans offer disease management, care coordination, and preventive care programs, but little information is available on the degree to which the plans generate better health outcomes than the traditional Medicare program," he said. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that if the government refused to pay MA plans more than traditional Medicare costs, that the taxpayers would save $9.5-billion in 2009, $54-billion over the 2009-2012 period, and $150-billion over 10 years. It was that last projection that Obama apparently used to come up with his $15-billion figure. Joseph Antos, a health policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, believes that if the additional money paid for MA plans is eliminated or severely reduced, "half the plans will drop out in two years." That won’t sit well with people in those plans, he said, and it’s likely to be strongly opposed by congressmen from rural districts – Republicans and Democrats alike – who have a high percentage of constituents in the MA program. Antos also takes issue with Obama’s characterization of the extra money paid for MA as giveaways to insurance companies. "In general, the extra money that goes to these plans ends up benefiting the beneficiaries to some extent," Anton said. The programs tend to have a lower co-payment for prescription drugs and premiums for medical services. "Does some of that stick to their (insurance company) fingers, of course," Antos said. It's Obama's interpretation when he calls the added payments for MA programs insurance company "subsidies" or "giveaways." But Obama is on solid ground when he estimates that the government spends about $15-billion a year extra on the private MA program than on traditional Medicare, particularly as we move forward in coming years. And so we rate his statement True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-10-17T00:00:00	2008-10-15	['None']
pomt-09751	During the Reagan administration, "Millions of people were thrown out of work."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/08/michael-moore/michael-moore-claims-his-movie-capitalism-during-r/	In his latest film, Capitalism: A Love Story , Michael Moore singled out the Ronald Reagan administration for the loss of millions of jobs. During the Reagan administration, he said, American government was run more like a business. The fallout of Reagan's "trickle-down" economic policy, he said, is that major corporations laid off American workers at the same time they were raking in enormous profits. And, he said, "Millions of people were thrown out of work." In backup material for that claim on his Web site , Moore points to a line from a May 28, 1991, article in the Washington Post : "Since 1980, 2 million workers have been cut from the U.S. manufacturing payroll. Millions more have accepted — or been forced to accept — reductions in earnings." A couple of things here. First, this is a 1991 article, and Reagan served as president from January 1981 to January 1989. In other words, the time frame referenced in the article includes a year before Reagan was in office, and 2 1/2 years after he left. The added time on each end makes a big difference. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, manufacturing jobs went from 19.3 million in January 1980 to 18.6 million in January 1981 (when Reagan took office), to 18.1 million January 1989 (when Reagan left office), and then down to 17.1 million by April 1991, the month before the Washington Post article was written. So the article is correct that 2 million workers were cut from the U.S. manufacturing payroll between 1980 and when the article was written in early 1991. However, while manufacturing jobs saw a major decline during a severe recession early in the Reagan years (dipping to a low of 16.7 million in January 1983), manufacturing jobs rebounded significantly during Reagan's latter years. So yes, millions of manufacturing workers lost their jobs early in Reagan's tenure, but if you look at the statistics over the entire eight years of the Reagan administration, the number of manufacturing jobs decreased by just a half million. One other point on manufacturing jobs: If you look at historical tables, the number of manufacturing jobs remained fairly stagnant from the late 1960s to the late 1970s, peaking in 1979 at 19.4 million jobs. Since that time, the number of manufacturing jobs has fairly steadily decreased — it was at 13.4 million jobs in 2008. "We've seen declines in the share of the work force that is manufacturing for decades," said Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute. "It wasn't just in the 1980s. That trend was going on before and since." The other point of context needed here is that Moore never specified manufacturing jobs when he said millions of people were thrown out of work. When you consider all types of employment, the picture is less dour. Again, jobs were lost during the recession early in Reagan's presidency, but overall the employed ranks grew from 100 million in January 1981 to 116.7 million in January 1989. And while the unemployment rate grew to more than 10 percent during the recession, the unemployment rate from the start of the Reagan era to the end was 7.5 percent to 5.4 percent. Lou Cannon, who has written several books about Reagan, called Moore's claim "pure fantasy," belied by the aforementioned statistics. "Reagan obviously, like Obama, came into office in the middle of a big recession," said Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute. But by the late 1980s, "all the indicators were extremely positive." Still, Edwards cautioned not to put too much stock in the political actions Reagan took as president on swinging various economic indicators. "Presidents only have so much effect over the economy or business cycles," he said. We should note that much of the slack in declining manufacturing jobs was more than picked up by a surge in service industry jobs, a trend that Moore highlights in the movie as well. Many would note that these service industry jobs generally pay lower than manufacturing jobs. Nonetheless, employment rates improved during the Reagan years. Factoring in for population growth, employment ratios grew by 2 percentage points over Reagan's eight years. And failing to note that while saying that millions of people were thrown out of work is misleading. We rate this claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-07433	Per-student K-12 state funding for Portland Public Schools has dipped from $6,036 in the 2007-2008 school year to $5,644 in the 2010-2011 school year	half-true	/oregon/statements/2011/apr/23/portland-public-schools/portland-public-schools-paints-picture-declining-s/	Come May 17, Portland voters will decide whether to OK a $548 million bond measure for upgrading city schools and where to increase the district’s operating levy from $1.25 to $1.99 per $1,000 of assessed property value). Naturally, Portland Public Schools is hoping they’ll vote "yes" twice -- and to help make their case, they’ve sent out a comprehensive mailer to some 230,000 residents outlining funding, student performance and a wide range of other facts and figures. As we thumbed through the report, one graph caught our eye: a yellow bar chart that showed "Per-student school funding in Oregon (State School Fund formula)" for the current and past three school years. The graph shows the funding down 6.5 percent this year as compared to the 2007-2008 school year. (Here’s how the pamphlet says the dollars break down: $6,036 in 2007-08; $5,989 in 2008-09; $5,834 in 2009-10; and $5,644 in 2010-11.) That 6.5 percent drop in state funding seemed a little suspicious, especially since we’ve heard for the past couple years that federal stimulus dollars helped keep funding relatively flat. What we really wanted to know was this: Has state school funding per student really dropped from $6,036 in 2007-08 to $5,644 to 2010-11? After phone calls to Portland Public Schools, the Oregon Department of Education and the Legislative Fiscal (Revenue) Office -- and winding up with different figures from each -- our collective head was spinning with numbers. So, we threw out the numbers we’d collected and started from scratch. Scratch being the Oregon Department of Education’s website. The Department of Education makes publica wealth of PDFs that lay out the amount of state funding distributed via the school fund formula -- the pot of money the graph addresses. We collected the most recent calculations for the years in question. We noticed right away that the numbers in the brochure were probably referring to Portland Public Schools funding and not Oregon funding generally. Spokesman Matt Shelby confirmed this. The graph had been mislabeled. That’s not ideal, but, while the mistake was sloppy, it wasn’t a definitive answer to our question. We still wondered if that decline had, indeed, occurred. So we adjusted our search and began calculating state funding for Portland Public over the past few years. We were looking for two numbers: The amount of funding the district received via the state school fund formula and number of students in the district. Both numbers can be a little elusive. On the first figure, the funding numbers the Oregon Department of Education keeps do not include the stimulus funding. On the second, there are actually two ways to count students. There’s the resident number -- the number of actual students being instructed -- and the weighted number -- students with certain needs count as more than one student because their education tends to cost more. There’s a pretty big gulf between the two figures. Take the current school year, for instance. Portland Public Schools is home to about 43,300 students; that’s "students" in the literal, you-could-do-a-head-count sense. Under the weighted number, it’s home to nearly 53,000. We asked Shelby which combination of the figures his district has used in creating the chart. Shelby said the district went with the weighted figure for student population and the state funds minus the stimulus dollars. When we used the same figures, we got slightly different numbers than what Portland Public had published. Try as we might, we could not find the discrepancy. That said, the overall decrease since 2007-08 was about 5 percent. No, that’s not the 6.5 percent from the brochure, but it’s pretty close. Next, we checked to see if anything much changed if we calculated per-student spending based on the actual number of physical students. When readers of the brochure saw the term "per student," that’s probably more along the lines of what they thought the district meant -- not an internal weighting system that suggests the district has 10,000 more students than it really does. That gave us a considerably higher per-student spending figure: $7,699 in 2007-08; $7,415 in 2008-09; $7,440 in 2009-10; and $7,234 in 2010-11. In no year did the district get less than $6,000 per student, as the brochure suggests is now the case. Still, if you do the math, you’ll notice the figure has dropped about 6 percent -- closer to the amount presented in the graph. Then, we added back in the stimulus dollars. That made a world of difference. With the stimulus, state funding actually dropped only 2 percent since 2007-08, from roughly $7,700 to $7,560 per "resident" student. Shelby pushed back on the calculation. "We're not going to give credit to the state for federal stimulus dollars," he said. The graph is "an effort to show our community that state support as gone down over the past few years." He has a point -- state funding, in the strict sense, has gone down. That said, the federal government came in to help backfill a hole that represented a decline in the economy -- not a conscious decision to roll back investment in public education. Had the feds not offered a bailout to Oregon schools, the Legislature would have likely made up at least part of that difference with cuts elsewhere so that schools didn't take that large a hit. Before we made our ruling, we had one lingering thought: What does the overall Portland Public Schools budget look like? Well, according to their website, their total funds budget is actually up: $636 million this year compared to $617 million in 2007-08. That said the budget this year is lower than last year’s $664 million pot. Meanwhile, the cost of education -- everything from supplies to teacher benefits -- keeps climbing year after year. Now, back to the case at hand. Has per-student spending in Portland really dropped from roughly $6,036 in the 2007-2008 school year to $5,644 in the 2010-2011 school year? Sort of. Clearly per-student funding has gone down, while inflation has been going up. Still, it’d probably be most accurate to say it’s dropped from approximately $7,700 to $7,230 -- if we’re talking strictly state dollars. And it’d be even more honest to point out that the state got an assist during bad times in the form of the stimulus, especially given those federal dollars were disbursed via the state school fund formula, which is what the graph claims to show. All things considered, this seems like a statement that is partially accurate but in need of some context. We’ll rate it Half True. Comment on this item.

pomt-04096	"In Minnesota, well over 6,200 election-day registrations from 2008 proved fraudulent."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jan/16/club-growth/wisconsin-fight-over-election-day-voter-registrati/	In the debate over making it easy for people to vote vs. making it hard to commit voter fraud, talk of eliminating Wisconsin’s same-day registration has become the new focal point. Republican lawmakers, expressing concern about fraud, have said they would introduce a bill to end election-day voter registration -- a procedure Democrats defend as a way to maximize voter turnout. Republican Gov. Scott Walker has said he wouldn’t sign such a bill. Nevertheless, the issue has not gone away. The Wisconsin Club for Growth stoked the debate in its newsletter on Dec. 12, 2012. The group alleged that in the November 2008 election in Minnesota, more than 6,200 election-day voter registrations were "fraudulent." Minnesota’s same-day registration, which allow residents to register to vote moments before casting a ballot, is similar to Wisconsin’s. The two states are among eight, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, that allow same-day registration. (Same-day registration is to begin in a ninth, Connecticut, in July 2013.) Claim fleshed out Here’s a closer look at the Club for Growth claim. "In Minnesota, well over 6,200 election-day registrations from 2008 proved fraudulent," the group charged in its newsletter. "Post-election efforts to verify names and addresses revealed one or both to be fictitious in that many cases. "Remember, 2008 was the election that made ‘Saturday Night Live’ clown Al Franken Minnesota’s junior (U.S.) senator, furnishing the crucial 60th vote for the monstrosity of ‘Obamacare.’ Franken’s winning margin? 312 votes." In Wisconsin in 2012, the newsletter continued, "same-day registration chaos prevailed at polling places in the June recall that narrowly deposed Republican state Sen. Van Wanggaard. The November presidential election saw 57,000 polling-place registrations in Milwaukee alone." In Wisconsin, election-day registration began in 1976, according to the state Government Accountability Board, which oversees elections. Like Minnesota, residents can use one of roughly a dozen proof-of-residence documents, ranging from a driver’s license to a residential lease to a recent utility bill to a paycheck. In fall general elections, roughly 10 percent to 15 percent of voters who cast ballots register on election day. Minnesota voting Asked for evidence to back its claim, Club for Growth Wisconsin pointed to an opinion article by Republican state Rep. Mary Kiffmeyer that was published in a Stillwater, Minn., newspaper in October 2012. Kiffmeyer served as Minnesota secretary of state from 1999 through 2006, heading the office that oversees elections there. In the 2008 presidential election, Kiffmeyer declared, "we have more than 6,200 ballots out of 23,000 cast by voters who still cannot be found." But while Kiffmeyer raised concerns about election integrity in her article, she did not state that the 6,200 ballots were fraudulent. That figure was generated nine months earlier, in a January 2012 report by Minnesota Majority. The group describes itself as a state watchdog that promotes "traditional values" such as "limited government, lower taxes, parental rights, free markets, protecting our borders and a strong national defense." The report contends there were 6,224 "unverifiable voters" in the November 2008 election and that Minnesota’s system "provides a window for fraudulent voting by use of false identities and/or addresses." Let’s take a look at how the Club for Growth went beyond the "unverifiable voters" phrase and turned it into "fraud." Minnesota Majority said that when local election officials mailed verification postcards to voters who did same-day registration for the November 2008 election, 6,224 were returned as undeliverable "without a valid explanation," such as the voter changing residences after the election. (The same sort of verification is also done in Wisconsin.) The group also said its volunteers found in "many" cases that addresses listed by same-day registration voters did not exist or were not in residential areas. "While not all returned postal verification cards are the result of fraudulent registrations, the large number of unexplained PVC returns is alarming," Minnesota Majority said in its report, noting the 312-vote Senate win by Franken. "Even if only a fraction of these returned cards were the result of fraudulent registrations, the numbers could be significant enough to affect the outcome of several elections." But Minnesota Majority overstates the number of same-day registrants who couldn’t be verified, according to the Minnesota secretary of state. Patricia Turgeon, spokeswoman for the office, said only 2,873 same-day registrations were flagged because of address problems. Turgeon said most of the 2,873 postcards likely were returned to local election officials because the voters moved sometime between the election and when the verification cards were mailed. She said there were also other reasons postcards couldn't be delivered, including: data-entry errors by local election officials; the voter's handwriting on the registration form was illegible; or voters were living somewhere where they cannot receive mail, such as in a battered women's shelter or on the street. As for actual cases of fraud, another secretary of state official, Beth Fraser, said there were about 140 convictions for election fraud in the November 2008 election. The vast majority of those voters were ineligible because of felony convictions. She said the state was not aware of a single fraud conviction from that election that was due to a voter providing a false name or address. Our rating Arguing for an end to election-day voter registration in Wisconsin, Wisconsin Club for Growth claimed that in the November 2008 election, more than 6,200 election-day voter registrations in Minnesota were "fraudulent." According to the Minnesota secretary of state’s office, the number of verification postcards that were returned is far overstated. What’s more, that alone is not proof of fraud. While it’s possible that some of those voters provided fraudulent information about their names or addresses, there is no evidence of more than 6,200 fraudulent same-day registrations. We rate the statement False.	None	Club for Growth	None	None	None	2013-01-16T09:00:00	2012-12-12	['Minnesota']
pomt-09809	"The claim ... that we plan to set up panels of bureaucrats with the power to kill off senior citizens ... is a lie, plain and simple."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/09/barack-obama/obama-correct-death-panel-charge-lie/	In his address to a joint session of Congress, President Barack Obama brought up the most explosive charge to emerge in the health care debate: the specter of "death panels." "Some of people’s concerns (about the health care legislation) have grown out of bogus claims spread by those whose only agenda is to kill reform at any cost," Obama told lawmakers and a national television audience on Sept. 9, 2009. "The best example is the claim, made not just by radio and cable talk show hosts, but by prominent politicians, that we plan to set up panels of bureaucrats with the power to kill off senior citizens. Now, such a charge would be laughable if it weren’t so cynical and irresponsible. It is a lie, plain and simple." The president was referring to a notion most prominently raised by former Alaska Republican Gov. Sarah Palin in a note posted on her Facebook page on Aug. 7, 2009. "And who will suffer the most when they ration care?" Palin wrote. "The sick, the elderly, and the disabled, of course. The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama's 'death panel' so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their 'level of productivity in society,' whether they are worthy of health care. Such a system is downright evil." We have read all 1,000-plus pages of the Democratic bill and examined versions in various committees. There is no panel in any version of the health care bills in Congress that judges a person's "level of productivity in society" to determine whether someone is "worthy" of health care. When we first assessed Palin's claim on Aug. 7, 2009, we gave it our lowest rating — Pants on Fire. Palin may have jumped to a conclusion about the Obama administration's efforts to promote comparative effectiveness research. Such research has nothing to do with evaluating patients for "worthiness." Rather, comparative effectiveness research finds out which treatments work better than others. The health reform bill being considered in the House of Representatives says that a Comparative Effectiveness Research Center shall "conduct, support, and synthesize research" that looks at "outcomes, effectiveness, and appropriateness of health care services and procedures in order to identify the manner in which diseases, disorders, and other health conditions can most effectively and appropriately be prevented, diagnosed, treated, and managed clinically." The idea here, which Obama and his budget director Peter Orszag have discussed many times, is to make it easier for doctors, health care workers, insurance companies and patients to find out which treatments are the most effective, as determined by clinical studies and other research. The House bill states in the section creating the Comparative Effectiveness Research Center and an oversight commission that "nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the Commission or the Center to mandate coverage, reimbursement, or other policies for any public or private payer." In other words, comparative effectiveness research will tell you whether treatment A is better than treatment B. But the bill as written won't mandate which treatment doctors and patients have to select. Nothing has emerged to suggest to us that the death panels claim is any more true today than it was when Palin first floated it. We still rate it as Pants on Fire today. In our book, that counts as a "lie, plain and simple." So we find Obama's claim True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2009-09-09T21:31:29	2009-09-09	['None']
pomt-05611	Says when Rhode Island Lottery was proposed, "state residents were enticed to vote for it with the promise that the money would be used for education."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/mar/28/harold-metts/ri-state-sen-harold-m-metts-says-voters-were-promi/	On March 6, state Sen. Harold M. Metts introduced a bill that would require any new state gambling revenue be used for education. That would include new revenue from the Twin River and Newport Grand slot parlors if they’re allowed to add casino table games. Metts said he wants any additional gambling revenue to be used solely for supporting elementary and secondary education. That "would be a positive step toward honoring years of promises to fund education with gaming revenue," he was quoted as saying in a General Assembly news release. "Senator Metts said he remembers the birth of the lottery in Rhode Island, when state residents were enticed to vote for it with the promise that the money would be used for education," the release says. Many Rhode Islanders share Metts’ belief that the Rhode Island Lottery was created based on the promise that the revenue would go into the schools. But is that conventional wisdom based on fact? When we asked what he based that statement on, Metts said that when he was campaigning for reelection last year, a senior citizen living at the Charlesgate nursing home grilled him about the lottery, saying that money was supposed to go to education. He said the constituent was "very knowledgeable about politics" and he’d be surprised if the man was incorrect. "The generation ahead of me -- all they talk about is that the money was supposed to go to education," he said. "In their mind, that money was supposed to go to education." So we went back in time to find out. Here’s some history about the lottery from its 2011 financial report. On Nov. 6, 1973, voters approved a constitutional amendment clearing the way for the lottery’s creation the following year. "The original purpose of the Rhode Island Lottery was to make up for the revenue lost from allowing the value of a trade-in automobile toward the sales tax liability on a new automobile," the report states. It says nothing about dedicating money for education. Now let’s go back a little further. On Sept. 25, 1973, The Providence Journal reported that then-Gov. Philip W. Noel "embraced the idea that the constitutional convention should propose outright repeal of the lottery ban." The story noted that a member of the convention’s lottery committee, Roderick A.J. Cavanagh, R-Narragansett, had proposed that net lottery proceeds "be applied exclusively to or in aid or support of education in this state." But two days later, the Journal reported that the convention’s lottery committee had voted 14 to 2 "against recommending that lottery proceeds be earmarked for a specific purpose such as education." In an interview Tuesday, Cavanagh said "early on (funding for education) was a prime mover in a lot of the discussion, but as you can see, it didn’t stay that way. As it turned out, the money went to general treasury." Another 1973 convention delegate, former Sen. Raymond E. Grimes, D-Providence, said officials talked about earmarking lottery revenue for education, "but it was never promised." The proposed constitutional amendment made no mention of mandating that lottery revenue go to education, and voters approved the amendment by a vote of 83,757 to 25,840. "Lottery is a big winner," the Journal front page announced on Nov. 7, 1973. The story quoted Noel’s lawyer as saying the governor was committed to "removing the inequity of the sales tax on auto trade-ins with the proceeds of a lottery," and that if proceeds are sufficient he also intended to examine other sales tax areas. The author of that 1973 story, former Journal political columnist M. Charles Bakst, said, "I do not recall a single official promoting the lottery by saying the money would go for education. In my opinion, this is a first-class myth." Peter J. O' Connell, who retired in 1993 after nearly 20 years as the Rhode Island Lottery’s first executive director, said lottery revenue went into the state’s general fund rather that any specific area in the state budget. O’Connell -- a retired state police major who joked that he "went from chasing bookies to being one of the biggest bookies" -- said that while some of that money ended up going to schools, the lottery revenue was never specifically earmarked for education. That notion might have been based on "rumors" or "wishful thinking," he said. Gerald S. Aubin, the Rhode Island Lottery’s director for the past 16 years, agreed that lottery revenue has always gone into the general fund. He could think of just a couple of rare exceptions when instant ticket revenue went toward specific purposes, such as the arts. Aubin said he often hears people saying that lottery revenue was supposed to be dedicated to education. "I’m often asked that question, or I hear it on the radio or see it in the newspaper. It has almost become factual," he said. "But I can never track down any evidence of that being the truth. Nothing I have ever seen supported that." Patrick T. Conley -- a lawyer and historian who served as secretary for the state’s 1973 constitutional convention and participated in drafting the lottery amendment -- said lotteries thrived in Rhode Island between 1744 and 1843, and the revenue went to a variety of civic purposes, including education. But Rhode Island banned lotteries in 1843, and when that ban lifted with the 1973 constitutional amendment, lottery revenue went into the general fund rather than being earmarked for a specific purpose, he said. "Certainly, a number of delegates in committee and in debate were hopeful that the revenue raised by the lottery would help fund our educational system, but there was never, to my knowledge, a serious amendment to earmark lottery money for education," Conley said. "The lottery was basically a revenue source for the state -- in emulation of New Hampshire, which had no income or sales tax but did have a lottery." Bakst said, "I do have a guess as to why folks think the money was to go to education; I believe that early states to have a modern lottery -- New Hampshire, say -- did specify that the money go to schools. These early lotteries got enormous publicity because lotteries were such a novelty." Indeed, New Hampshire launched the country’s first state lottery in 1964, and all the net revenue was earmarked for public education between kindergarten and 12th grade, New Hampshire Lottery Commission spokeswoman Maura McCann said. "That was the whole reason it passed successfully," she said. To date, the lottery has raised about $1.5 billion for New Hampshire public schools, she said. Our ruling Sen. Harold Metts said he remembered that voters were enticed to vote for the lottery because the proceeds would be used for education. As it turns out, Metts, a retired educator, has inadvertently provided Rhode Island with a teachable moment. He certainly is not the first person to make that claim. But if he had done his homework, he would know that all the evidence shows that no such promise was made. We rate his statement False.

pomt-13647	"I haven't switched my position" on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/07/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-he-hasnt-changed-his-position-trans/	Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine defended Hillary Clinton from public skepticism over her trustworthiness and addressed his own pro-trade baggage Aug. 7 on NBC’s Meet the Press. Clinton has "learned from" her email controversy and will be "real transparent" moving forward, Kaine said. While Clinton’s trust issue lies predominantly with independent and Republican voters, Kaine’s critics are progressives who fault him for his perceived past support of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Host Chuck Todd said Kaine "essentially switched" his position on the trade deal to align with Clinton’s own flip-flop, but Kaine begged to differ: "I haven’t switched my position," he said. "I was a strong supporter a year ago of giving President Obama the ability to negotiate a trade deal. But I said at the time, when that deal was done and on the table, I was going to look at it very carefully. And I even expressed a very serious concern I had with how it was developed, which is that companies were given rights to enforce provisions, but the labor and environmental provisions could not be effectively enforced. That was never fixed. I've asked again and again to understand this piece of the TPP. And I've never gotten a good answer. We can't have a deal that cannot be enforced. And so, for that reason, yeah, I'm going to oppose it in the lame duck if it comes up after Election Day." Has Kaine’s position on the trade deal been consistent? Kaine’s turn on the trade deal was not as dramatic as the presidential nominee’s. But there was still a noticeable shift when he became Clinton’s running mate. Kaine is against the deal now, but he had kinder things to say about it before without taking a firm position. Many point to Kaine’s support for Trade Promotion Authority — which allows the president to negotiate a trade treaty with only an up-or-down vote on the final package in the Senate — as proof of his pro-TPP stance. Kaine was just one of 13 Senate Democrats who voted in June 2015 to give Obama fast-track authority. On the day of the vote, Kaine explained his thinking to The Atlantic. "For my sake, I got assurances I need that made me feel comfortable voting today. But I've got a backstop, which is if those assurances are not met, then I will vote against the treaty when it eventually hits the table," he said. "I'm not going to vote for TPP when there is no program to retrain workers who are affected by trade." That’s roughly what he’s been saying for the past year and a half: He supports giving Obama negotiating authority, but would wait for TPP to be finalized before taking a stance on it. Here are some examples of what he’s said: • May 7, 2015, interview with Politico: "I tell everybody the same thing: I’m pro-trade, but it’s got to be under the right conditions, and I want to make sure that that’s the case." • May 14, 2015, statement to the Hampton Daily Press: Giving Obama fast-track authority "gives the U.S. the best chance of elevating the standards for global trade in ways that will level the playing field," but "as we prepare to take up major trade initiatives in the coming months, my biggest priority is ensuring we can negotiate enforceable deals that protect workers' rights, environmental standards and intellectual property, while eliminating barriers that some countries erect to keep American products out." • May 16, 2015, column in the Richmond Times-Dispatch: "I will support TPA because it gives the U.S. the best chance of elevating the standards for global trade in ways that will level the playing field for our workers, farmers and companies. My support for TPA is not a blind endorsement of any pending trade negotiation. Once we establish our key principles, I will make sure that the specifics of any final deal are placed before the public and fully debated to see if they meet our standards and help Virginia." • June 18, 2015, interview on the John Frederick Show: "I support the president’s ability to try to negotiate trade deals that other presidents have had — that’s the Trade Promotion Authority. And if the president and his team can get a good deal with the 12 Pacific rim nations — this Trans-Pacific Partnership — I will be supportive of a good deal. I won't support a bad deal." • Nov. 5, 2015, statement applauding the public release of the deal: "I look forward to having extensive dialogue with Virginians about the provisions of the deal." So Kaine is right that he never took an official stance on TPP and has always advocated for labor and environmental provisions. But in recent weeks, he’s also praised the deal without saying he would support it. (The Senate voted for fast-track authority in June 2015, but TPP itself has yet to be ratified. Given that Clinton and Donald Trump are both against the deal, supporters are hoping a lame-duck Congress will pass it before 2017.) "I see much in the TPP draft — which has now been public and apparent to everybody for quite a while — that I like," he said to Politico on July 11. "There’s one piece that I’m still really digging into is the dispute resolution." "I am having discussions with a lot of groups around Virginia about the treaty itself. I see much to like. I think it’s an upgrade of labor standards, I think it’s an upgrade of environmental standards. I think it’s an upgrade of intellectual property protections," he told the Intercept on July 21, a day before Clinton announced him as her VP pick. Kaine then formally came out opposing TPP when he officially joined the ticket. When asked how Obama felt about Kaine’s shift on the deal, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said he’d let Kaine speak for himself. Our ruling Kaine said, "I haven’t switched my position" on TPP. Though Kaine voted to give Obama fast-track authority to negotiate trade deals, a piece of legislation that paved the groundwork for TPP, he never took an official position on the deal itself. Throughout 2015, he reiterated he would oppose the deal if it didn’t have strong environmental and labor provisions. But in July 2016, Kaine repeatedly praised TPP for including those exact protections. Days later, as Clinton’s running mate, he came out against the trade deal.

pomt-05502	Says his sons were "targeted" on Facebook "by out-of-state protesters."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/apr/15/scott-walker/wisconsin-recall-target-scott-walker-says-teens-so/	When Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said his two teen sons have been "targeted" on Facebook, the news was quickly picked up by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and national outlets such as Fox News, Politico, Talking Points Memo, the Daily Beast and the Huffington Post. Walker didn't elaborate on his claim in the April 4, 2012 interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network. But in a March 31, 2012 speech to the Waukesha County Republican Party in suburban Milwaukee, he disclosed a few more details: "People ask me all the time: How do you do deal with all the grief? How do you deal with the thousands of people who were bused in in front of your house in Wauwatosa? How do you deal with the hecklers, how do you deal with attacks? The kids had stuff on Facebook targeted after them by out-of-state protesters and other things like that." The first-term Republican governor has repeatedly claimed that out-of-state interests backed public demonstrations against him and are promoting efforts to remove him from office in the June 5, 2012 recall election. And after Walker stripped most Wisconsin public employees of most collective bargaining powers with a March 2011 law that spurred the demonstrations and the recall, Republican politicians as well as Democrats who opposed the law received death threats. In November 2011, authorities investigated but did not file charges against a woman who posted a message about Walker on Facebook saying: "Rather than recall him. can we kill him instead? Just curious." And a Madison radio talk show host in November 2011 criticized Walker’s wife, Tonette, and called her names when she said on Milwaukee radio that she worried for her sons’ safety after protesters demonstrated outside of their home. Facebook claim But Walker saying family members have been targeted on Facebook is a new dimension. Walker campaign spokeswoman Ciara Matthews pointed to a December 2011 article by the MacIver Institute, a conservative think tank and news organization in Madison. The article said that on Nov. 27, 2011, Miles Kristan posted this message (complete with the grammatical errors) on Facebook: "Whats it like having the most hated dad in Wisconsin ??? this kid knows." A picture accompanying the article shows the post, which included a link to Matt Walker's Facebook page; the link included a photo of Matt Walker. According to the article, after posting the item about Matt Walker, Kristan immediately posted another message saying "this kid knows as well," with a link to Alex Walker's Facebook page. Both posts were also shown in a news report on WTMJ-TV (Channel 4) in Milwaukee. So, there is evidence that Walker's sons, both of whom attend a public high school in suburban Milwaukee, were "targeted" at least one time on Facebook. Matthews did not provide other examples. We also contacted Jocelyn Webster, a spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Capitol Police. She told us the department does not comment on security issues. As for Kristan, he is a protester, but he’s not from out of state. Kristan has been identified in news reports as a Wisconsin resident and a native of Racine, south of Milwaukee, who moved to Madison to participate in protests against Walker. He was also identified as a leader of some of the protests. State court records list Kristan with Wisconsin addresses dating back to 2003 and as recently as February 2012. They also show he was convicted of misdemeanor disorderly conduct after pouring a beer on state Rep. Robin Vos, R-Rochester, in a Madison bar in September 2011. Our rating Walker said his sons were "targeted" on Facebook "by out-of-state protesters." A protester posted two critical messages on Facebook, one directed at Matt Walker and one at Alex Walker, but the protester is from Wisconsin. We rate Walker's statement Half True.

pomt-14002	"The president has said the national security threat facing America, the top one, is global warming."	mostly false	/arizona/statements/2016/jun/03/paul-babeu/arizona-sheriff-says-obama-called-global-warming-a/	Paul Babeu, the Republican Sheriff of Pinal County, Ariz., near the U.S.-Mexico border, has repeatedly criticized President Barack Obama’s administration for its lack of border security. Babeu, who’s running for Congress this November against a Republican field that includes David Gowan, Ken Bennett and Wendy Rogers, warned of Mexican drug cartels in his county ahead of Memorial Day weekend on Fox News’ Hannity on May 26. But he also used the interview to make a political jab, questioning Obama’s priorities. "The president has said the national security threat facing America, the top one, is global warming," Babeu said. "It’s not an unsecured border, it’s not the terrorists we should be fighting and defeating." This is not the first time we have heard a statement like this: In June 2015, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker claimed Obama said global warming is the "No. 1 threat to the military and world today." The president has said global warming is a serious threat, but it is not No. 1. We rated it Mostly False. We wondered whether Babeu’s claim holds any weight a year later. Contrary to Babeu’s claim, the president’s top national security threat appears to be terrorism. Out of context In March, after the terrorist attacks in Brussels, Obama said, "I’ve got a lot of things of my plate, but my top priority is to defeat ISIL." When we asked for evidence on climate change being the top priority, Tim Gaffney, a spokesman with the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office, noted that Obama has made this claim during speaking engagements. Obama has said global warming is a serious threat and has linked it to national security. But, looking back at news reports over the last year, Obama has never explicitly said it was the top national security threat. Rather, he has said global warming is a threat to the whole world. In an April 2015 weekly address, he said "there’s no greater threat to our planet than climate change." In May 2015, Obama also said during a U.S. Coast Guard Academy commencement address that climate change "is one of those most severe threats." "So I’m here today to say that climate change constitutes a serious threat to global security, an immediate risk to our national security," Obama said. "And make no mistake, it will impact how our military defends our country." We should also point out that the U.S. military has focused on the potential threat of climate change going back to President George W. Bush’s administration. In a December 2015 interview, Obama defended his remarks on climate change, noting at the same time that while terrorists will be "defeated," climate change is the "kind of crisis that we can’t deal with through the deployment of Marines." Our ruling Babeu said, "The president has said the national security threat facing America, the top one, is global warming." Obama continues to cite climate change as a great threat to the world, but framing the issue as the country’s top national security threat is an exaggeration. Obama has said fighting terrorism is his most urgent priority. The Arizona sheriff ignores important context, so we rate his claim as Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0cb68a01-985c-4db8-96bb-cc03740e77a6	None	Paul Babeu	None	None	None	2016-06-03T20:00:00	2016-05-26	['United_States']
pomt-06978	"From now on, we have to pay the Russians $50 million an astronaut to send Americans to the space station"	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/jul/13/marco-rubio/rubio-says-us-will-pay-russia-50-million-astronaut/	The July 8, 2011, launch of space shuttle Atlantis from Kennedy Space Center in Florida marked the end of NASA's shuttle program after three decades. On CBS the day before the launch, Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio voiced concerns about letting the shuttle program lapse, and made a point about the cost the United States will incur while the program is dormant. "From now on, we are going to have to pay the Russians $50 million an astronaut to send Americans to the space station. And we have no plans to have anything in place to replace the shuttle any time before 2016," Rubio said. "For Washington, it should be ashamed that it took so long to deal with this, and that something's not in place. But it's important for America moving forward, because other countries are, China, India, are investing heavily in their space programs. We cannot afford as Americans to lose space supremacy." We were curious about what sounded like an astronomical cost to hitch a ride into space. $50 million a round-trip ticket? (Can you at least check bags for free?) The root of the claim comes from contract modifications the United States signed with the Russian Federal Space Agency for crew transportation, rescue and related services. The idea of having contracts with Russia isn't new, but these contract modifications were crafted to offset the end of NASA's shuttle program. An April 6, 2010 a NASA press release stated that NASA had signed a modification to a contract with the Russian Federal Space Agency for crew transportation in 2013 and 2014. The additional cost -- $335 million -- would cover training, preparation and landing for six crew members. That math works out to about $55.8 million per astronaut. Then in March 2011, NASA modified the contract with the Russians again to provide six seats a year in 2014 and 2015 for $752 million, or about $62.7 million per astronaut, per trip, said NASA spokeswoman Stephanie Schierholz. The increase reflects inflation in Russia, she said. Rubio used the updated figure of $63 million in an op-ed piece published July 9, 2011 in the Tallahassee Democrat. As we noted, contracts with the Russians started long before the shuttle shutdown. The United States has had a contract with the Russians for spaceflight support and services since 1993. During the 1990s, American astronauts traveled to the Russian space station Mir several times. The first U.S. astronaut to fly to the International Space Station on a Soyuz was Bill Shepherd on Oct. 31, 2000. "The idea is that if we purchase services to the International Space Station -- whether through the Russian Soyuz or when commercial providers come on line -- eventually it frees up money for NASA to invest in developing a transportation system that will take us beyond low-earth orbit," Schierholz said. NASA already has contracts with private companies to provide remotely piloted flights and several are competing for NASA funds to develop flights to carry astronauts, according to Space.com. A note about the costs. While $50 million or $63 million sounds awfully expensive, it is obviously less costly to taxpayers than if the United States continued its space shuttle program. With the shuttle program ending, NASA's space operations budget will shrink from $6.1 billion in fiscal year 2010 to $4.3 billion in fiscal year 2012. The space operations budget is broken into three categories: the space shuttle, International Space Station and Space and Flight support. The space shuttle line item is expected to dwindle during the next few years -- from $664.9 million in fiscal year 2012 to less than $1 million in 2016. NASA will pay for the contract with the Russians out of the line item for the International Space Station -- and that part of the budget is expected to rise from about $2.8 billion in 2012 to $3.2 billion in 2016. (For the record, most of the costs associated with the shuttle program are fixed -- meaning NASA would pay out hundreds of millions of dollars for salaries and for parts whether the shuttle flew 1 time a year or 12. Schierholz said the marginal cost -- the additional cost associated with each individual shuttle launch is around $100 million, primarily for the external tank and two solid rocket boosters.) Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos said the overall cost wasn't Rubio's point. The crux of the comment was to illustrate that the United States now has to rely on Russia to get into space. "The main point is that, whereas once the U.S. led the way in space travel, we’re now beholden to another country – Russia – to get to space and to the space station," he said in an e-mail. Back to Rubio's original comment. He said, "From now on, we have to pay the Russians $50 million an astronaut to send Americans to the space station." In an op-ed piece a few days later he noted that the contract had risen to $63 million -- which is the current figure. That's a lot of money per astronaut -- but there are two caveats worth mentioning. First, NASA has had a contract to pay the Russians to send someone to the International Space Station for more than a decade. And second, the overall space operations part of NASA's budget is dramatically declining so while $50 million or $63 million sounds outrageous -- it's something of a bargain. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2011-07-13T14:44:28	2011-07-07	['United_States', 'Russia']
pomt-03780	"A study by the University of Virginia pulls back the curtain on Medicaid’s tragically bad outcomes, including ‘increased risk of adjusted mortality.’"	half-true	/virginia/statements/2013/apr/01/pete-snyder/pete-snyder-says-university-virginia-study/	Expanding Medicaid in Virginia would imperil the lives of low-income people who have surgery, according to Pete Snyder, a Northern Virginia businessman who is seeking the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor. "As it stands, Medicaid’s immense price includes a very real and tragic human cost: all too often it actually harms the very people it is meant to help," Snyder wrote in a March 6 article for Bearing Drift, a conservative blog. "But don’t take my word for it," he continued. "A study by the University of Virginia pulls back the curtain on Medicaid’s tragically bad outcomes, including ‘increased risk of adjusted mortality,’ or as one report summarizes, ‘surgical patients on Medicaid are 13 percent more likely to die than those with no insurance at all.’" We were struck by the ramifications of Snyder’s claim. Under Obamacare, states are being encouraged to expand Medicaid, the government-run healthcare program for the poor and disabled. In return, Washington is offering to pay all the new costs at first, and 90 percent of the new tab in 2020 and thereafter. Expansion in Virginia, which is strongly opposed by Gov. Bob McDonnell, would open Medicaid to an estimated 400,000 people. Across the nation, about 16 million would become eligible for Medicaid if every state accepted the Obamacare offer. Almost all of these people are now uninsured -- making too little money to afford private health insurance but earning above the poverty levels that qualify for Medicaid. The U.Va. study is being cited by several conservatives -- including former U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas -- as an argument against expansion. They say the study offers evidence that spreading Medicaid will spread bad health care results. Fact-checking Snyder’s statement requires two determinations: 1) Did the U.Va. study actually find that Medicaid recipients face a greater risk of surgery-related death than uninsured people and all other categories of patients and, if so; 2) Was the heightened risk caused by Medicaid? The U.Va. study, published in 2010, considered how surgical patients fared during their hospitalization based on whether they had private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid or were uninsured. The researchers looked at almost 900,000 major operations across the country and adjusted for many population and health care variables, including age, income, region, type of hospital, type of operation and other health factors. "Even after adjusting for all those things, the payer was still a predictor of poorer outcomes," Dr. Gorav Ailawadi, one of the authors of the paper, told us. The patients covered by Medicaid had the highest risk. They were 1.97 times more likely to die in the hospital than those with private insurance. Compared to the privately insured, Medicare recipients were 1.54 times more likely to die in the hospital and uninsured patients were 1.74 times more likely. With adjustments, Medicaid patients also had the longest hospital stays and greatest total costs. So Snyder is correct -- those covered by Medicaid did have an increased risk of mortality during their hospital stays. And he’s right that Medicaid recipients were 13 percent more likely to die in the hospital during or after surgery than uninsured patients. But researchers place little of the blame on Medicaid. They noted that Medicaid recipients are the poorest, sickest and least educated group of patients. They are the least likely group to seek preventive health care. As a result, they are more likely to enter hospitals in dire conditions that require emergency surgery. "Medicaid patients had the highest incidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, depression, liver disease, neurologic disorders and psychoses," the study said. "Furthermore, Medicaid patients had the highest incidence of metastatic cancer." The researchers said that uninsured patients have similar characteristics to Medicaid recipients and that it is "plausible" that both groups may suffer from a "system bias" that limits their access to private hospitals and top physicians. "For many surgical patients, private insurance status often allows for referral to expert surgeons for their disease," the study said. "Alternatively, Medicaid and uninsured patients may have been referred to less skilled and less specialized surgeons." Does the research prove, as Snyder and other conservatives suggest, that it’s safer to be uninsured than on Medicaid? Ailawadi, co-author of the study, said it does not. Not all of the uninsured patients in the study were low-income people who would qualify for Medicaid if it is expanded. Thirty-one percent of them lived in zip codes where the average household income was greater than $45,000. Many of these people may have been uninsured by choice. "The uninsured population in our study included a subgroup that may have had a high income," Ailawadi said. He added, "I don’t think we’re able to say a government-sponsored system is beneficial or not." Our ruling Snyder is opposed to expanding Medicaid. He said, "A study by the University of Virginia pulls back the curtain on Medicaid’s tragically bad outcomes, including ‘increased risk of adjusted mortality.’" He’s partly right. A U.Va. study in 2010 did find that Medicaid recipients were more likely to die in the hospital during or after operations than all other surgery patients, including those who were uninsured. But he runs into trouble when he suggests that Medicaid is the cause of the high death rate. The authors of the report note that those who qualify for Medicaid are a high-risk group to begin with.

pomt-14426	Regarding her State Department email practices, "my predecessors did the same thing."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/09/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-said-my-predecessors-did-same-thin/	Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s decision to exclusively use private email to conduct State Department business was not unprecedented, she said at a Democratic debate in Miami. At the March 9 debate, Univision’s Jorge Ramos asked Clinton where she divined permission for her email setup and whether she had a different set of expectations for herself than she did for her employees. "I’m going to give the same answer I’ve given for many months," Clinton replied. "It wasn’t the best choice. I made a mistake. It was not prohibited. It was not in any way disallowed, and as I’ve said and now has come out, my predecessors did the same thing, and many other people in the government." There’s a couple problems with Clinton’s talking point that her State Department predecessors used email practices similar to hers. First of all, there’s the fact that most of Clinton’s predecessors did not regularly use email. Just four former secretaries of state have held the job during the prominence of electronic communications: Clinton, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright. According to MSNBC, an aide for Albright said she "did not use email while she was in office" from 1997 to 2001. And Rice, head of the State Department from 2005-09, was not a habitual emailer either, according to multiple reports. So that leaves Powell, a regular email user, as Clinton’s only predecessor who serves as a useful comparison. When we reached out to the Clinton campaign, they pointed us to Powell. Like Clinton, Powell used a personal email address. However, there’s a big difference: Clinton hosted her email on a private server located in her home. Powell did not. Many politicians use private addresses, but private servers like the one Clinton used are rarely seen, said John Wonderlich, a policy director at the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan group focused on government transparency, for a prior PolitiFact story. And there’s a big difference between a private account, which is generally free and simple to start, and a private server, which requires a more elaborate setup. The Atlantic speculated the Clintons "may have wanted to be in control of the encryption of their correspondence, ensuring that no third parties — whether commercial, hacker, or government — were able to snoop on them." The unorthodox approach has opened up questions about her system’s level of security. If the server was managed without the help of a third party, "you would have to have a staff that’s keeping up with all the latest fixes," said Clifford Neuman, director of the University of Southern California’s Center for Computer System Security. We should note that the State Department has flagged a handful of emails containing information now deemed classified that were received by Powell and aides to Rice at private email addresses. In the more than 50,000 pages of Clinton emails the State Department has reviewed, just over 100 sent by Clinton have been deemed classified, according to a Washington Post analysis. It’s unclear whether the information was classified at the time the emails were sent. Our ruling Clinton said, regarding her State Department email practices, "my predecessors did the same thing." This is a misleading claim chiefly because only one prior secretary of state regularly used email, Colin Powell. Powell did use a personal email address for government business, however he did not use a private server kept at his home, as Clinton did. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-11544	Says Donald Trump is "canceling funding for Obama’s free house and library."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/feb/12/patriot-report/no-trump-didnt-cancel-funding-obama-presidential-l/	A viral story on Facebook says that President Donald Trump decided not to pay for Barack Obama’s presidential library, but no such thing happened. Trump is "cancelling funding for Obama’s free house and library," the Jan. 17 headline on the Patriot Report said. The story provides no evidence and contradicts actual information about how the Obama library will be funded. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The Patriot Report said that after Trump learned that Obama ordered the U.S. Education Department to divert more than $8 million to build the library, Trump rescinded the money and diverted it to privately held charter schools. Michelle Obama was going to get a private residence on the top floor, but Trump supposedly cancelled that, too. "Obama will have no recourse but to try to raise the money or pay for the project himself, but without the big donors and connections of a great Republican president, he’ll probably be stuck buying something that looks like a Bush’s guest home," the story said. In the past, presidential libraries have been constructed with private or non-federal funds donated to nonprofit organizations. Some libraries have also received construction and development funding from state and/or local governments. The library is then transferred to the federal government and operated and maintained by the National Archives and Records Administration, a federal agency, through its congressionally appropriated operating budget. Some staff and programs at the libraries are paid for with funds from associated private foundations organized to fund the construction of the library. In May 2017, the Obama Foundation and the records agency announced that the arrangement for Obama’s library would be different from existing presidential libraries. The Obama Presidential Center in Chicago won’t be in the library network operated by NARA. The center will be privately operated and built by the Obama Foundation, which will raise money for the center. Rather than build a presidential library to hold paper records, the Obama Foundation is providing NARA with digital records. NARA will store and preserve the original materials in an existing NARA facility. University of Louisville Professor Benjamin Hufbauer, an expert on presidential libraries, said the Obama library gains a couple of benefits by opting out of the typical presidential library system. First, the library won’t have to raise the congressionally-mandated 60 percent of the cost of construction endowment for future maintenance. Also, the library won’t have to build an archival facility for documents, films, video, electronic records. Similar ridiculous stories about the cancellation of funding for Obama’s library have circulated on other websites for months. Factcheck.org found the same story on the Last Line of Defense in December 2016. While that website had a disclaimer that said "we present fiction as fact and our sources don’t actually exist," the Patriot Report had no such disclaimer. We found no evidence that Trump had rescinded any such funding for the library. In reality, the Obama Foundation will raise money for the center in Chicago. We rate this headline Pants on Fire.

pomt-00016	"The number of people who just got their voting rights restored in Florida is greater than the populations of Wyoming, Vermont, Alaska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Delaware, Rhode Island, Montana, Maine and New Hampshire."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2018/nov/08/steve-galloway/more-felons-regained-right-vote-florida-population/	Florida has had one of the toughest processes in the nation for felons to regain their voting rights, but that changed on election night when voters approved amending the state constitution to restore the right to vote to many felons. How many? News articles put the figure at above 1 million. One observer -- an NYU business professor -- compared it to the population of several states: "The number of people who just got their voting rights restored in Florida is greater than the populations of Wyoming, Vermont, Alaska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Delaware, Rhode Island, Montana, Maine and New Hampshire," tweeted Professor Scott Galloway who told PolitiFact that he wasn’t involved in Amendment 4 in Florida. Galloway was talking about the states individually and not combined. We found that it was difficult to pinpoint the number of felons who are now eligible to vote but estimates put it above the residential population of many smaller states. Adding up the eligible felons Amendment 4, approved by about 64 percent of voters, amends the state Constitution to restore voting rights of Floridians with felony convictions after they complete the terms of their sentence including parole or probation. It does not apply to those convicted of murder or sexual offenses. Florida has previously had one of the toughest processes in the nation for felons to regain their voting rights, which involved waiting for years and then appearing before the governor and state Cabinet. The Palm Beach Post found that the current Cabinet, made up entirely of Republicans, restored the voting rights of twice as many whites as blacks. Two leaders of organizations that advocated for Amendment 4 -- Marc Mauer at The Sentencing Project and Howard Simon at the ACLU of Florida -- wrote a memo in February that estimates how many felons could regain the right to vote. Their conclusion: as many as 1.4 million. Here’s how they arrived at the figure: They started with the total Florida disenfranchised population, which they estimated was about 1.7 million. Then they subtracted felons who are not eligible including those convicted of murder or felony sex crimes, those in prison or in jail, under probation or supervision or who have not paid fees, fines or victim restitution. That ultimately leaves a group of about 1.4 million. However, there are some factors that could bring that number lower including many of those felons have not paid restitution, fines or fees. In Florida, a 2007 analysis by the Department of Corrections found that of 80,000 people awaiting rights restoration nearly 40 percent had not completed restitution payments, the ACLU and the Sentencing Project found. Failure to pay restitution would make them ineligible to vote. And if we apply the 40 percent level of non-payment, that could reduce the eligible population from 1.4 million to about 840,000. Many news outlets have cited the 1.4 million figure. We asked some state officials questions about the figure and did not receive back any replies that disputed it. The day after the amendment passed, the state Division of Elections had not released any details about how the amendment will be implemented, other than to stay it takes effect in January. (Many state and county election officials were focused on expected recounts following the election.) Census populations Galloway’s tweet said that the number of felons who can regain the right to vote is larger than the population of of 10 states that ranged from about 579,000 (Wyoming) to 1.3 million (Maine and New Hampshire.) If we use the estimate of 1.4 million Florida felons are now eligible to vote, then Galloway’s tweet is correct. If we assume that the number of eligible felons is lower due to non payment of fines -- around 840,000 -- then six states on this list have a higher population. State Census population estimate July 1, 2017 Wyoming 579,315 Vermont 623,657 Alaska 739,795 North Dakota 755,393 South Dakota 869,666 Delaware 961,939 Rhode Island 1,059,639 Montana 1,050,493 Maine 1,335,907 New Hampshire 1,342,795 Our ruling Galloway tweeted that "the number of people who just got their voting rights restored in Florida is greater than the populations of Wyoming, Vermont, Alaska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Delaware, Rhode Island, Montana, Maine and New Hampshire." The populations of the states Galloway cited range from about 579,000 to 1.3 million million. The number of felons who are now eligible to register to vote is as many as 1.4 million, according to the ACLU and the Sentencing Project. However nonpayment of fines could bring that number down to 840,000. In that scenario, six of the 10 states on Galloway’s list have a higher population. Galloway’s tweet generally seems on point though it could be that the ultimate number of eligible felons is a lower number than some of the states’ populations he cited. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-01751	Since 1999, 440 people have been killed in attacks on church property in the United States.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2014/aug/01/georgiacarryorg-georgiacarryorg/gun-groups-church-violence-stats-cant-be-verified/	It’s been a month since House Bill 60 became law and cleared the way for Georgians to carry concealed weapons in several new venues – all bars, many government buildings and, generating the most news coverage, churches that allow it. Jerry Henry, executive director of GeorgiaCarry.org --- a pro-gun group that advocates for fewer gun restrictions --- repeated a strikingly high and somewhat specific number in defending allowing guns in sanctuaries. More than 440 people have been killed in attacks on church property since 1999, he told Georgia Public Broadcasting this spring. A reader questioned that figure shortly after the bill became law on July 1. We decided it was a worthy target for the AJC Truth-O-Meter. Already, PolitiFact found flaws in a specific count from the other side of the gun debate. Everytown for Gun Safety claimed there were 74 school shootings in the United States since Sandy Hook, a tally that included incidents such as a teacher who committed suicide in a school parking lot overnight. We rated that claim Mostly False. Henry told PolitiFact Georgia that he relied on two specific websites, Cops and Cross and Carl Chinn's church security site, for the statistic. He used the term church generically, to cover all houses of worship. Cops and Cross is run by Jimmy Meeks, a former police officer who teaches church safety across the country. A recent banner on the site listed more than 470 "violent deaths on church and faith-based property since 1999," but does not include sources for those figures. Instead, it directs users to the site run by Carl Chinn, a former building engineer for Focus on the Family. Chinn was among responders when a gunman took four people hostage at the conservative Christian group’s headquarters, and later surrendered, in 1996. Chinn said in an email that he relies on news reports, official records and blog items for his figures. Many incidents have multiple sources. That count, though, includes broad incidents not likely to be considered attacks. For instance, the first page of incidents for 2014 show at least two suicides on church property that, according to news reports, are not connected to the house of worship. GeorgiaCarry.org’s claim could also not be backed up with unimpeachable data elsewhere. The Centers for Disease Control found that the majority of the 166 deaths that occurred at houses of worship between 2003 and 2011 were suicides. But the National Violent Death Reporting System covers only 17 states, including Georgia. The CDC cannot provide specific numbers on suicides from the total figure, a spokeswoman said, because that sample is too small. That means the figures are not nationally representative and cannot be used to create an estimate to verify or refute Chinn’s numbers. There is similar incomplete coverage from the National Incident-Based Reporting System, with only about 38 percent of Uniform Crime Reporting agencies providing information, according to the FBI. Without more data, the FBI cannot verify the statistic. The federal government has generally stopped funding such research over political battles between gun control advocates and gun rights advocates. Several prominent social scientists have asked that barriers to firearms research be lifted, and President Obama has signed an executive order for the CDC to research causes and prevention of gun violence. Without reliable statistics, Chinn’s data could be the best approximation of data available. And although advocates often speak with more certainty than data supports, David Kopel, the research director at the Libertarian-leaning Independence Institute, said there is value in stories behind some of the numbers. Anecdotally, backers of Georgia’s law need only to point to Matthew Murray, who killed two missionaries in a Colorado church’s mission training center in 2007, Kopel said. Murray continued his spree by killing two more people at the New Life Church in Colorado Springs. A congregant volunteering to help with security shot Murray, who then took his own life. There have been incidents closer to home. In July 2012, two people were killed in a shootout with each other outside a funeral at Victory for the World Church near Stone Mountain. In October of that year, Floyd Palmer gunned down Greg McDowell as he led a prayer at World Changers Church International in College Park. Palmer also was charged in 2001 with shooting a man outside a Maryland mosque. "Are there incidents where someone comes into church with a gun, with the intent to commit suicide? I’m sure," said Clayton Cramer, an adjunct history professor at the College of Western Idaho who specializes in firearm history. "How often? We don’t know." "Until such time that we have some real, hard data," Cramer added, "the best thing to say is, there are examples where a churchgoer having a gun during a confrontation mattered or would have mattered," And that is where the claim of specific counts falls short. The data has some value in capturing the number of attacks on or at religious institutions. But there is no way to remove suicides from the death counts to ensure a more strict definition of attacks as understood by the general public. Without that ability, even a claim with some truth gives the wrong impression. We rate it Mostly False.	None	GeorgiaCarry.org	None	None	None	2014-08-01T00:00:00	2014-04-09	['United_States']
pomt-03702	"The NRA used to support expanded background checks."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/18/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-nra-used-support-expanded-backgr/	After the Senate failed to advance an amendment that would expand federal requirements for background checks on gun purchasers, President Barack Obama took to the White House’s Rose Garden to denounce the vote, calling it "a pretty shameful day for Washington." Flanked by relatives of some of the slain children from Newtown, Conn., and assassination survivor Gabby Giffords, Obama emphasized how broadly Americans support expanded background checks for gun purchases. At one point, Obama invoked his gun-policy adversary, the National Rifle Association. "Even the NRA used to support expanded background checks," he said. "The current leader of the NRA" -- referring to Wayne LaPierre -- "used to support these background checks." This echoed a similar claim we checked earlier this year. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said on NBC’s Meet the Press that "if you go back to 1999, Wayne LaPierre testified on behalf of the NRA that background checks were appropriate and should be done." We’ll recap what we found when checking the comment Bloomberg made. On May 27, 1999, LaPierre testified before the House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime. The Columbine High School shooting, in which 12 high school students and one teacher were murdered, had happened a month earlier. To rebut what he saw as a demonization of the NRA and its members, LaPierre listed a number of actions and laws he said were good policy. First on that list was this: "We think it's reasonable to provide mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show. No loopholes anywhere for anyone," he said. "That means closing the Hinckley loophole so the records of those adjudicated mentally ill are in the system. This isn't new, or a change of position, or a concession. I've been on record on this point consistently, from our national meeting in Denver, to paid national ads and position papers, to news interviews and press appearances." He also spoke in favor of preventing juvenile felons from ever owning guns, setting up instant background checks at gun shows, and keeping schools gun-free. There’s additional evidence, too. New York magazine, in a January 2013 story, dug up the advertising campaign LaPierre mentioned in his testimony. Titled "Be reasonable," the NRA ads that ran in national newspapers said, "We think it's reasonable to provide for instant checks at gun shows just like at gun stores and pawn shops. But what's unreasonable is how the proposed Lautenberg legislation ignores the 250,000 prohibited people, like felons, who've walked away from gun stores — instead of being prosecuted for a federal felony for trying to buy a gun." We contacted the NRA for our previous story but did not receive a response. In January, NRA board member Sandy Froman told CNN, "The NRA has changed its position, and the reason it's changed its position is because the system doesn't work." LaPierre himself acknowledged this change in a January 2013 Senate hearing in the wake of the Newtown, Conn., elementary school shooting. "I do not believe the way the law is working now, unfortunately, that it does any good to extend the law to private sales between hobbyists and collectors. … The fact is, the law right now is a failure the way it's working," he said. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., then said, "I understand, back in 1999, you said no loopholes anywhere for anyone. But now you do not support background checks for all buyers of firearms?" LaPierre responded: "I think the National Instant Check System, the way it's working now, is a failure. Because this administration is not prosecuting the people that they catch. Twenty-three states are not even putting the mental records of those adjudicated mentally incompetent into the system. Now, assume that if you don't prosecute, and they try to buy a gun, even if you catch them, and you let them walk away, to assume they're not going to get a gun -- they're criminals, they're homicidal maniacs, and they're mentally ill. I mean, we all know that homicidal maniacs, criminals and the insane ... don't abide by the law." The NRA’s website on March 12, 2013, posted its firm stance against expanding background checks. Our ruling In his Rose Garden comments, Obama said "the NRA used to support expanded background checks." He’s correct: In congressional testimony following the Columbine High School shooting, LaPierre called it "reasonable" to conduct a background check "for every sale at every gun show. No loopholes anywhere for anyone." Subsequent statements by NRA officials acknowledge that the group’s position has since changed to opposition to more background checks. So we rate Obama’s statement True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2013-04-18T15:37:46	2013-04-17	['None']
pomt-12436	"Fox star Tucker Carlson in critical condition (then died) after head on collision driving home."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/may/15/blog-posting/liberal-troll-behind-tucker-carlson-death-hoax-spr/	Fox News host Tucker Carlson was the latest conservative media icon targeted by a death hoax after Internet stories surfaced that said he had been killed in a car crash that was no accident. "Fox star Tucker Carlson in critical condition after head on collision driving home," read the headline on a May 13, 2017, post on DailyUsaUpdate.com, a known fake news site. Other suspect sites also ran the story. Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to cut down on bogus news in users’ feeds. The fake story said that Carlson was driving home from Tucker Carlson Tonight in New York when he "was rammed in what looked like an act of violence and not an accident." The post claimed Carlson was taken to a hospital for surgery, while the driver of a Ford Explorer with a reinforced bumper and extra foam padding on the steering wheel fled the scene after hitting the news anchor. That article was followed the next day by another on DailyUsaUpdate.com that said Carlson had died from his injuries, and that police had ruled the death a homicide. The story strongly suggested the crash was deliberate, and had something to do with either the Clinton Foundation, former FBI director James Comey’s firing, or both. This follow-up, too, ended up on other websites. First of all, we know the story is fake, because Carlson is alive. A Fox News Channel spokeswoman confirmed to us that the articles are a hoax. She also noted that Carlson is based in Washington, not New York. The post is yet another fake news story created by the parody purveyor TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a website that has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked. TheLastLineOfDefense.org publishes bogus posts keyed to topics designed to troll conservatives. The site’s creator, a man who said his name is Zeke Wilekenmeyer, has told PolitiFact he deliberately worked to get gullible readers to share his stories to prove those readers don’t rely on facts. The articles quite often end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without an indication that they are fake. The original fake post that Carlson had been in a crash appeared on the site on May 13, and its follow-up was published May 14. Then TheLastLineOfDefense.org published another story on May 14 that said the death rumors were actually a hoax perpetrated by someone who goes by the name Busta Troll. He had been paid more than $100,000 by billionaire George Soros to make up the story, the post said. While the update is written to make it sound as if TheLastLineOfDefense.org had been fooled into thinking Carlson had died because of Busta Troll, the real story is that Wilekenmeyer (or whatever his true name may be) actually is Busta Troll. The troll character is part of a years-long saga involving the author "goating" conservative web pages and using pseudonyms to spread contrived stories aimed at fooling conservative readers. A complex scheme to expose the identity of Busta Troll in 2014 turned out to be yet another trolling scenario. TheLastLineOfDefense.org had followed a similar strategy in April 2017 when saying that conservative rocker Ted Nugent had first been killed in a hunting accident, then had been assassinated, then had actually faked his own death. Nugent was still alive, and so is Carlson. We rate this statement Pants On Fire! See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2017-05-15T16:27:05	2017-05-13	['None']
pomt-14277	Says Rick Scott "stripped women of access to public health care."	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/apr/06/rick-scotts-starbucks-heckler/did-gov-rick-scott-really-cut-access-womens-health/	When Gov. Rick Scott walked into a Starbucks in downtown Gainesville, he got an earful from a woman who attacked his positions on health care. A video of the woman yelling at Scott for about a minute drew more than 259,000 hits on YouTube in about 24 hours and was shown on national television the next day. "You cut Medicaid so I couldn’t get Obamacare," yelled the woman, Cara Jennings, a former Lake Worth city commissioner who is now a stay-at-home mother. "You are an a------! You don’t care about working people. ... You should be ashamed to show your face around here." Scott countered by saying, "We’ve got a million jobs." "A million jobs? Great. Who here has a great job or is looking forward to finishing school? Do you really feel like you have a job coming up?" Jennings said. "You stripped women of access to public health care. Shame on you, Rick Scott! We depend on those services." In this fact-check we will explain whether Scott "stripped women of access to public health care." Jennings is referencing a law Scott signed in March that pertains to clinics that provide abortions. (Here is our fact-check about her comments on Medicaid, an issue on which we gave Scott a Full Flop for changing his position on Medicaid expansion in 2015. We also checked Scott's claim about 1 million jobs.) Scott’s action related to public health care The Palm Beach Post in 2010 described Jennings, then a city commissioner, as an advocate for the poor, illegal immigrants and homeless. We could not reach Jennings for comment. She told the Palm Beach Post and ABC Action News in Tampa that she had been reading about Scott signing a bill that cuts money for Planned Parenthood. Here's what Jennings had to say on Facebook: "I am upset about the awful bill Governor Scott signed last week - cuts funding to Planned Parenthood and restricts abortion access. Just last night I looked online to see if there is a march planned to defend our rights to abortion. And then today, the Governor walked into the coffee shop I was at.....and left with no coffee. (video credit to the stranger who recorded the scene)." On March 25, Scott signed a bill that removes state funding from any clinic that does abortions. HB 1411 passed the House 76-40 and the Senate 25-15, and it takes effect July 1. A key provision in the law is that it prohibits public funding for an organization that owns, operates or is affiliated with a licensed abortion clinic. The law includes several requirements for abortion clinics, including annual licensure inspections, and prohibits selling or transferring fetal remains. In 2014, there were 72,073 abortions performed in Florida. Federal funding is already banned for abortions due to the federal Hyde Amendment, which includes limited exceptions. Florida’s Medicaid program will cover an abortion if needed to save the life of the mother or if she got pregnant as a result of rape or incest. Those exceptions continue under the new law. Planned Parenthood serves about 5,500 Florida patients through Title X, a family-planning program that it provides through a state contract, and about another 2,000 more people through Medicaid in Florida. The state Department of Health spent about $139,000 for the Title X services provided by Planned Parenthood in 2014-15 and expected to spend about $163,000 in 2015-16. The Florida Medicaid program paid about $106,000 in claims to Planned Parenthood in 2014-15, according to staff analysis of the bill. Planned Parenthood offers many types of services beyond abortion, including birth control, STD testing and cervical cancer screening. These are the types of services that state dollars supported. So how much will Planned Parenthood lose in annual funding? We heard figures ranging from $114,000 from Scott’s office to $500,000 from Planned Parenthood. Scott’s office argued that the funding cut is small compared to the overall state dollars given to clinics. "Over $5 million in state funds are provided for non-abortion services at many charitable clinics and county health departments," according to a March 30 statement by Scott. "HB 1411 makes sure no state funds can indirectly fund abortions by supporting the same institutions that perform them. For Planned Parenthood, this would only affect about $114,000 in funds they get annually." Family planning services remain funded at various clinics and centers that don’t provide abortions, including all 67 county health departments. So Jennings exaggerated when she said that Scott "stripped women of access to public health care" because access to certain types of health care remain available. The Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates issued its own statement that Scott was low-balling the amount of money clinics could lose. Laura Goodhue, executive director of the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates, told PolitiFact Florida that she expects the total loss of money to be closer to $500,000. In a news release, Planned Parenthood said Scott was downplaying the effects "of patients losing access to care by only sharing the state funds that would be prohibited under this legislation. However, because the legislation is broadly written, Planned Parenthood will also lose access to reimbursements from local government entities and federal funding from the Title X program that is contracted through local county Health Departments." Planned Parenthood arrived at a potential figure of losing $500,000 based on $50,000 for Medicaid, $147,000 for Title X, and then funding for specific services or counties -- the largest chunk in Palm Beach. The two Planned Parenthood affiliates each had a budget of about $11 million last year. Planned Parenthood is determining whether it can find alternate sources of funding, so it couldn’t yet say how many fewer patients may be served. Also, 70 percent of Planned Parenthood centers are located in medically underserved areas, which means that sometimes they are "the only place where people can receive publicly funded family planning services," according to Planned Parenthood. Critics of Florida’s new law say similar provisions in Texas led about 20 clinics to shut down. Critics of the Texas law argued that it was unconstitutional before the U.S. Supreme Court in March. A spokesman for the ACLU of Florida said that it is analyzing the impact of the law but it hasn’t announced any decision about whether it will challenge it in court. Supporters of the bill, such as John Stemberger of the Florida Family Policy Council, argued that it will protect women. The federal government has warned state officials that the bill may place Florida out of compliance with federal Medicaid law that bans states from restricting individuals from accessing care from any qualified provider. But it’s unlikely federal officials will consider action until the law goes into effect July 1. Our ruling The Starbucks activist said Scott "stripped women of access to public health care." Scott signed a law this year that cuts off state funding for any clinic that provides abortions, including Planned Parenthood. We heard estimates that it will cut anywhere from $114,000 to $500,000 for Planned Parenthood, which provides other health services to low-income women. It’s possible to wrongly assume from Jennings’ statement that Scott slashed women’s health care services broadly across the state. The cut targets abortion clinics, so it isn’t a cut for health care offices that don’t provide the procedure, such as county health departments. There is some truth to the statement, but it’s too soon to tell exactly how the law will curtail women’s access to publicly supported health care.

pomt-00347	Scott Wallace wants to tax families of five for 'irresponsible breeding'	false	/pennsylvania/statements/2018/sep/14/national-republican-congressional-committee/no-congressional-candidate-scott-wallace-does-not-/	Scott Wallace’s family foundation has caused quite a few headaches for the multimillionaire, who is running for U.S. Congress in Pennsylvania’s 1st District. The GOP and conservative media outlets have used grants made by the Wallace Global Fund, which the candidate led for more than a decade, to paint the Democrat as anti-Israel and anti-police. Wallace will face Republican incumbent Brian Fitzpatrick in a recently redrawn district that includes Bucks County and left-leaning Philly suburbs. A number of stories published this summer by right-leaning outlets focused on grants the foundation made to so-called population control groups. Now, a particularly incendiary claim has made its way into a TV ad created by the National Republican Congressional Committee. The ad claims Wallace "wants to tax families of five for ‘irresponsible breeding.’" The NRCC released a similar web ad that states Wallace "thinks families with more than two children should be ‘taxed to the hilt.’" Does Wallace, who has three children, actually advocate for a multi-child tax? We decided to fact-check the claim. When contacted for comment, NRCC Regional Press Secretary Chris Martin cited a Fox News article from July that reported on the Wallace Global Fund’s donations to groups that advocate limiting population growth. As Fox News reported, the Wallace Global Fund donated money to a group called Zero Population Growth — now known as Population Connection — between 1997 and 2003. From the article: The group, shortly after being founded in 1968, released a brochure advocating abortion to stabilize population growth and claimed that "no responsible family should have more than two children." To deal with larger families, it also called for families to be "taxed to the hilt" for "irresponsible breeding." According to Wallace’s spokesperson, Zoe Wilson-Meyer, the candidate inherited the foundation from his parents in late 2003, after the donations were made. While the foundation's 990 tax form for that year lists Wallace as "president," internal meeting minutes show he was elected to that position in December 2013, according to Wallace Global Fund Executive Director Ellen Dorsey. Regardless of when Wallace took over his family’s foundation, it’s clear that he supports the aims of groups that seek to stabilize population growth through voluntary family planning. His father, the late Robert B. Wallace, was co-chairman of Population Action International, which advocates for increased access to birth control and other family planning methods. "When my generation took over the foundation in 2002 after my parents had both passed away, we developed an increasing focus on the climate crisis, which has only reaffirmed the importance of our population work," Wallace wrote in an essay for the Universal Access Project. "The population trajectory, combined with the inevitable aspirations of people in emerging economies to burn more fossil fuels and own more stuff – just like Americans! – is worse than unsustainable; it’s a pathway to disaster. And population growth won’t abate unless women have access to voluntary family planning, and girls are protected against coerced early marriage and childbearing." Under Wallace’s leadership, the foundation gave grants to Population Action International as well as the Population Council and Worldwatch Institute. The grants were earmarked for purposes including eradicating female genital mutilation, "research on population and the environment," and "global reproductive health and rights," according to the foundation’s Form 990 tax documents. The NRCC’s Martin also pointed to an endorsement for Wallace by the Population Connection Action Fund, the political arm of the group that produced the 1968 brochure. This isn’t the first time the NRCC has tried to link candidates endorsed by the fund to the brochure’s content. As The Morning Call reported, Martin emailed reporters about the organization’s endorsement of Democrat Susan Wild in Pennsylvania’s 7th District: "Out of curiosity, how many children does Susan Wild think families should be able to have before they’re taxed to the hilt?" Brian Dixon, a spokesperson for the Population Connection Action Fund, told the paper, "We do not advocate for increasing taxes on parents of any size family. We believe that parents should have exactly the number of children that they want." Dixon reiterated that statement when contacted by PolitiFact Pennsylvania, adding that he has never seen the 1968 brochure. "Even if it exists, it was written 50 years ago," Dixon said. "The world has changed a lot since." Wallace's campaign spokesperson said he does not personally advocate for a multi-child tax, and PolitiFact Pennsylvania was unable to locate any public records to contradict that statement. Our ruling When Scott Wallace held the reins, the candidate's family foundation awarded grants to nonprofits that advocate for family planning in order to limit population growth worldwide.

pomt-05945	Republican-leaning states get more in federal dollars than they pay in taxes.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/26/blog-posting/red-state-socialism-graphic-says-gop-leaning-state/	Many GOP-leaning states get more in federal funding than they contribute in federal taxes. That's the point made by a graphic that’s circulating on the Internet, titled "Red State Socialism." A reader recently pointed us to it and asked us to check it out. The chart suggests that Republicans are hypocritical for bashing the federal government and federal spending, when Republican-leaning states are reaping the lion’s share of federal dollars. The graphic emphasizes this point by showing two tables side by side. States that send more money to the federal government than they receive in federal spending are on the left, and they are primarily blue (or Democratic) states. The table on the right shows states that receive more in federal spending than they contribute in taxes. This table is predominantly red (or Republican). The graphic says: "Of the 32 states which receive more than they contribute, 27 states (84%) are REPUBLICAN. Of the 18 states which contribute more than they receive, 14 states (78%) are DEMOCRATIC." The source cited is a report by the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group. We checked with the Tax Foundation to see whether the data was legitimate and confirmed that it is. Spokesman Richard Morrison said that the chart uses 2005 data that was published in 2007. So the graphic is solidly grounded in reality. But we see two reasons for caution when using this chart. How do you define red and blue states? The graphic defines Republican states as those "that have voted Republican in a previous presidential election." Because the data is from 2005, that means states that voted for George W. Bush in 2004, which is a larger number than voted Republican in 2008. But the definition of states as Republican or Democratic isn't immutable. Just four years later, in the 2008 election, six states in the right-hand chart and three states in the left-hand chart switched from Republican to Democratic, making both charts more heavily blue. We should also note that some of the margins of victory were quite narrow. In fact, a dozen or more states can be characterized in most elections as swing states, which might be more appropriately shaded in purple. The data is seven years old As we noted, the data is for 2005. To the author’s credit, this is disclosed prominently, and because it’s the most recent data of its type available, we can hardly fault the creator of the graphic for using it. Still, since the data has almost certainly shifted in the interim, particularly with the 2009 stimulus and the general increase in deficit spending, those patterns could have shifted as well. "Because of the high deficit spending we’re seeing at the federal level, it’s likely that every state is currently receiving more in federal spending than its population paid in federal income taxes," the Tax Foundation's Morrison said. We tracked down the creator of the graphic, Jesse Erlbaum. Erlbaum said he was inspired to create the graphic after watching a presidential debate scene from the television show The West Wing, in which fictional Democratic President Jed Bartlet needles his Republican opponent, the governor of Florida, for seeming to diminish the importance of federal funds that his state receives. Erlbaum said he created the graphic "for fun" in October 2008, just before Barack Obama won the presidency. "Based on that, I selected the most recent previous presidential election cycle, namely 2004." That explains the chart’s use of older electoral data; it simply hasn’t been updated by subsequent posters. Erlbaum conceded the concerns we laid out. "It's definitely true that choosing a different election cycle and basis for assigning red versus blue will produce different results," he said. As for the age of the data, Erlbaum said, "I would love to see an update of this report." Erlbaum added, "I've listened to feedback about this chart for a few years now, and folks who don't like the insinuation it makes will always come up with some explanation. Popular ones are that there are more military jobs, more retirees, more farmers, and fewer cities in red states. I don't buy it. Whatever the excuse, the data is clear: These states receive more than they pay in. Everything else is just a rationalization based on someone deciding that one reason for spending money is good, and another is bad. This chart makes no such distinction. I say, ‘Deal with it!’ The facts are the facts." Our ruling The graphic’s data uses data from the 2004 election rather than 2008, and the figures on taxes and spending date back to 2005. There are fewer states that would be labeled Republican based on the 2008 election, and there’s a strong likelihood that tax and spending data would have changed as well. Because of this likelihood, we downgrade the accuracy of this generally accurate chart to Mostly True.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2012-01-26T17:37:19	2012-01-26	['None']
pomt-00333	"Arnold Schwarzenegger: 'I would be a better president than Trump ...2020 wait for me do you agree??"	false	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/sep/18/blog-posting/did-arnold-schwarzenegger-say-he-would-be-better-p/	A website called the Colorado Post claims that actor and former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said he would do a better job than President Donald Trump. "Arnold Schwarzenegger: ‘I would be a better president than Trump ...2020 wait for me do you agree??’" said the headline of a Sept. 9 story posted on coloradopost.site, which doesn’t appear to be affiliated with the newspaper Denver Post. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We could not find a verbatim quote of Schwarzenegger saying, "I would be a better president than Trump ...2020 wait for me do you agree??" In February 2017 Schwarzenegger, a vocal Trump critic, suggested that he and Trump switch jobs. "Hey, Donald, I have a great idea: why don’t we switch jobs, you take over TV, because you’re such an expert in ratings and I take over your job and then people can finally sleep comfortably again, hmm?" Schwarzenegger said in a video posted on Twitter. Text in Schwarzenegger’s tweet said, "The National Prayer Breakfast?" That day Trump delivered a speech at the National Prayer Breakfast and mocked Schwarzenegger for low ratings on the NBC show The Apprentice. Trump in January 2017 also taunted Schwarzenegger’s ratings compared to Trump’s time on the show. In response to that tweet, Schwarzenegger tweeted: "I wish you the best of luck and I hope you'll work for ALL of the American people as aggressively as you worked for your ratings." Beyond Colorado Post’s headline, there’s no indication in the story of when or where Schwarzenegger purportedly said that he would be a better president than Trump — and to wait for him in 2020. (Schwarzenegger is ineligible for the U.S. presidency since he is not a natural-born U.S. citizen. He was born in Austria.) The story rather talked about the causes and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and said Schwarzenegger "definitely hates Trump." "Shocking confession of Arnold Schwarzenegger made us think of his big hate," the story said. "A few day (sic) ago we say headlines of him telling Trump has PTSD." Coloradopost.site does not include any information on its website detailing who’s behind it or a way to contact its operators. (There are fields to post a comment to the story.) We found no evidence of Schwarzenegger saying exactly what the site claims — including to wait for him in 2020. Making up quotes, even if the some of the sentiment has been expressed before, is a big no-no. We rate the headline False.

pomt-13432	"Texas has lost the most law enforcement officers in the line of duty of any state in America."	true	/texas/statements/2016/sep/19/charley-wilkison/texas-top-state-law-enforcement-deaths-line-duty/	After the July 2016 ambush shootings of five Dallas police officers, there was much discussion about the dangers of police work and if (or how) the shootings, which also wounded nine officers and two civilians, might damage police-community relations. Amid the talk, the Texas Standard, a weekday public-radio program that airs around Texas, drew a claim to U.S. history from Charley Wilkison of the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas (CLEAT), a law enforcement advocacy and lobbying group. Laura Rice, interviewing Wilkison, said: "I wondered if there’s been sort of a heightened sense of fear since Dallas or if officers are also kind of feeling an outpouring of support from communities." Wilkison, CLEAT’s executive director, replied: "I think there’s a heightened sense of reality because the fear part, of course officers are trained to deal with that. But Texas has lost the most -- and I say that every time you guys invite me on -- Texas has lost the most law enforcement officers in the line of duty of any state in America. So that’s absolutely something they (police officers) are aware of coming into the job, coming into the profession." We wondered if Texas truly is No. 1 by this unfortunate indicator. By phone when we inquired, Wilkison told us his statement was based on figures from the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement (TCOLE). He also texted a photo of an ad CLEAT posted to the May 2016 edition of American Police Beat which stated that 1,959 Texas officers had been killed in the line of duty. To our inquiry, the commission’s Ken Mobley, said in an email that the names of "1,955 law enforcement officers are on the Texas Peace Officer Memorial. These are the individuals who were approved by the commission as per TCOLE rules of eligibility, some (individuals) dating back to the early 1800s." Wilkison’s figure turned out to be higher than other counts we found of law enforcement deaths for Texas though two other analyses support the notion that Texas leads in officer deaths. As of Sept. 7, 2016, when we looked, the Officer Down Memorial Page (ODMP) -- which was cited by Wilkison and others as a data source and is curated by a nonprofit that says it’s dedicated to honoring America's fallen law enforcement heroes -- listed Texas’ count at 1,866 officer deaths (plus 12 deaths of K9 dogs) across 27 cause-of-death categories: SOURCE: Web page, "Texas Line of Duty Deaths," Officer Down Memorial Page, (accessed Sept. 7, 2016) The group’s Texas tally, which considered deaths as far back as 1837 (before statehood), folded in 1,096 deaths by gunfire including the 1930 death of Uvalde Chief of Police John F. Connor and the July 2016 deaths in Dallas. Another 61 Texas deaths, from 1858 through 2007, were attributed to accidental gunfire. Among other populous states, per the group, California and New York had lost 1,569 and 1,568 officers, respectively, in the line of duty; Illinois had sustained 1,070 such deaths; and Florida had tallied 757 line-of-duty deaths. Seeking other counts, a web search led us to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund (NLEOMF), which says it’s dedicated to honoring and remembering the service and sacrifice of U.S. law enforcement officers and that as of March 24, 2016, Texas had sustained 1,682 law enforcement deaths--compared to 1,571 in California, 1,375 in New York and 1,013 in Illinois. To our inquiry, a fund spokesman, Steve Groeniger, told us by phone that Wilkison got it right about Texas having the most law enforcement deaths. The fund says on its "law enforcement facts" web page: "New York City has lost more officers in the line of duty than any other department, with 705 deaths. Texas has lost 1,682 officers, more than any other state. The state with the fewest deaths is Vermont, with 23." Groeniger also mentioned the FBI’s Law Enforcement Officers Killed or Assaulted (LEOKA), collected as part of their Uniform Crime Statistics. According to emailed figures provided by Stephen Fischer of the FBI, some 457 officer deaths in Texas since 1980 led other states and accounted for nearly 10 percent of 4,736 officer deaths nationally. California followed closely behind with 436 deaths. Our ruling Wilkison said: "Texas has lost the most law enforcement officers in the line of duty of any state in America." This appears to be so, both of late (since 1980) and since the 1800s. We rate the claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

pomt-06145	Says Oregon canned blueberries will be cheaper in South Korea thanks to a trade agreement.	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2011/dec/20/ron-wyden/will-free-trade-deal-drop-price-oregon-canned-blue/	U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden held up a can of Oregon Fruit Products blueberries at the Oregon Business Summit last week as an example of the state’s market expansion abroad. The berries are picked in the Willamette Valley, packed in light syrup and, according to Wyden, will be less costly for South Koreans thanks to a recent trade agreement. "Because of the Korean free trade agreement, South Koreans who want Oregon blueberries are gonna see their prices go down because we will be getting rid of a 45 percent tariff on this Oregon product," he said. "That's what I mean when I'm talking about expanding trade." As we’ve previously noted, sometimes we check a statement because it strikes us as wrong. Other times, we just want to learn more. And in this case, we just wanted to know more about the trade agreement and how it might affect Oregon products, in this case, our plump, nutritious, not-too-sweet blueberries. The pact, years in the negotiating, should make it easier to sell U.S. products to 49 million consumers in South Korea. Tariffs imposed on U.S. goods will be phased out or eliminated outright. So, the 40 percent tariff on U.S. muscle beef will be eliminated over 15 years. Fresh cherries, with its 24 percent tariff, will be duty-free as soon as the pact is in effect. The same goes for dried apricots, wine and grape juice. The tariff on canned blueberries is now 45 percent, as Wyden said. Unlike the tax on fresh cherries, the tax on canned blueberries will be phased out to zero over a decade. In 2012, the tariff will drop to 40.5 percent and in 2013, the tariff will be 36 percent. In 2016, the tariff will be 22.50 percent and in 2021, zero percent. It’s not clear when the new tariff rate will kick in. Dalton Hobbs, assistant director of the Oregon Department of Agriculture, says that while the pact technically is in effect now, practically speaking it’s not. "People who were waiting for this are probably going to sit on the sidelines for another few weeks until all of the mechanisms are fully in place for products to move," he said. South Korea is Oregon’s fifth largest export market, accounting for nearly $1 billion in sales last year. Hobbs estimates that Oregon producers will see an increase in sales in the $50 million to $100 million range over the next 12 months. That should increase significantly, Hobbs said. We asked Joseph Peterson, the president of Oregon Fruit Products, whether he anticipated a cost reduction for South Korean consumers. He explained that his sell price will stay the same, because the burden of the tariff is borne by the importer, and eventually the consumer. "As that duty goes away, the importer's cost will be less," he said. The price reduction "should go all the way to the consumer." We called the Office of the United States Trade Representative to see how eliminating a tariff over the longer term usually affects the price of the commodity. "Tariff reductions should lower prices of those goods receiving the tariff reductions," Carol Guthrie, an official at the office, said in an e-mail. "The price reduction may not equal the tariff reduction on a one-to-one basis (the issue of whether companies fully pass through the savings to the final consumer). "If consumer prices have gone up due to inflation, etc over the phase in period, then these prices would have been even higher if the tariffs were not reduced." Already, 2011 has been a landmark year for Oregon blueberries in South Korea. In a separate move, food officials there have authorized for import the first ever fresh blueberries from the United States. Of course, they will come from Oregon. By next summer, our blueberries should join berries from British Columbia and Chile in Korean markets. "Korea is just wild for blueberries, dermal cream, food products, it’s in other items as well, blueberry shampoo, all manner of consumer goods," says Bryan Ostlund, executive director of the Oregon Blueberry Commission in Salem. But we digress. In a printed version of the speech circulated by Wyden’s office, the senator was supposed to hold up the can of blueberries and say that "South Koreans who want Oregon blueberries are now paying 45 percent less per can." It’s a good thing he didn’t end up saying that. Such a statement would have been False. But what Wyden said is fairly accurate. It makes sense that South Koreans who want canned blueberries from Oregon should see prices go down -- or not increase as much -- over time, because the tariff on the product will decrease. But the tariff is going to be phased in slowly, so the full savings are still a ways off. We think Wyden’s statement needs that clarification. Based on our findings, we rate the statement Mostly True: accurate but needing additional information. Let us know what you think, by heading over to OregonLive and leaving a comment.

pomt-12534	Images show the turnout for President Donald Trump's 2017 ceremony with the New England Patriots was smaller than the team’s turnout with President Barack Obama in 2015.	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2017/apr/20/new-york-times/new-york-times-tweet-fumbles-comparisons-patriots-/	The New York Times faced criticism after implying in a tweet that far fewer members of the New England Patriots football team attended a White House visit with President Donald Trump than just two years ago with President Barack Obama. The newspaper’s sports account sent out a tweet that linked to a story about how fewer Patriots players were at the 2017 ceremony than in prior years. The tweet included the following images, and was sent out at 4:25 p.m. Eastern on April 19, 2017: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The top image is the team’s trip to the White House on April 23, 2015, to celebrate the Patriots’ victory in Super Bowl XLIX. The bottom image is their April 19 visit for their come-from-behind win in Super Bowl LI. The post was retweeted almost 49,000 times. The photos appear to show that a mere fraction of the team showed up to visit Trump, compared to the sprawling entourage that visited Obama. The comparison recalled the January 2017 dispute over images showing smaller crowds for Trump’s inauguration than for Obama’s 2009 swearing-in. But while several players were absent from the 2017 visit, it’s difficult to fairly compare the two photographs. The 2015 photo showed the team and its administrative staff, while the 2017 photo did not. The Patriots pointed this out at 8:45 p.m. the same day, noting that more than 40 staff members were seated instead of lining the staircases, forcing the New York Times to backpeddle a bit. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Why no photo with the entire staff this year? "That’s just what the White House chose to do," team spokesman Stacey James told the Boston Globe. The Patriots provided the Globe with a photo the team had tweeted of the ceremony’s rehearsal that did include more than 100 players and staffers. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Another tweet from the team included images that the Patriots said were a fair comparison by showing only the players and not the full staff. That example included a photo of the team visiting President George W. Bush on May 10, 2004. The New York Times updated its tweet by noting that the Patriots said 34 players visited in 2017 and 50 attended in 2015, but the total number of team and staff was "roughly the same." The newspaper’s story noted that several key Patriots players like LeGarrette Blount, Chris Long, Alan Branch, Dont’a Hightower, Martellus Bennett and Devin McCourty had stayed away specifically because they did not support Trump. Patriots owner Robert Kraft and head coach Bill Belichick have described themselves as Trump’s friends. So has quarterback Tom Brady, who had announced in a statement before the gathering that he would be absent because of "personal family matters." Brady also skipped the 2015 ceremony. NESN Patriots reporter Doug Kyed tweeted out a list of players who did not attend the ceremony before the New York Times story published. We attempted to contact both the New York Times and the Patriots via phone and email, but neither responded with any comment beyond prior public statements. Another element to the attendance appears to be that, well, it’s just not all that special for a team that’s won five Super Bowls since 2002 to visit the White House. The New York Times story provided figures from James, who said 45 players went to the White House in 2002, when Bush was president, closer to 2015’s 50 players. But in 2004 and 2005, the players numbered closer to this week’s 34 player attendees. (WBZ-TV sports anchor Dan Roche tweeted 36 players went in 2004, and just 27 in 2005.) New York Times sports editor Jason Stallman took responsibility for the deflating juxtaposition in an emailed statement to the Washington Post: "Bad tweet by me. Terrible tweet. I wish I could say it’s complicated, but no, this one is pretty straightforward: I’m an idiot. It was my idea, it was my execution, it was my blunder. I made a decision in about four minutes that clearly warranted much more time. "Once we learned more, we tried to fix everything as much as possible as swiftly as possible and as transparently as possible. Of course, at that point the damage was done. I just needed to own it." Even so, Trump took to his Twitter account the next morning to accuse the Times of lying: See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com The White House had no further comment when we contacted a spokesman. Our ruling The New York Times’ comparison made it appear the turnout for President Donald Trump's 2017 ceremony with the New England Patriots was smaller than the team’s turnout with President Barack Obama in 2015. While many Patriots players did skip the April 19 ceremony, some to avoid Trump, the use of the images together made a false equivalency. The 2015 photo shows not just players, but also Patriots staff members, while the 2017 photo does not. The New York Times updated their tweet and story, and the sports editor has apologized. While fewer players showed up at this year’s White House ceremony, it wasn’t drastically different than similar situations in prior years. If we’re talking just players, the team has said 34 players visited in 2017, compared to 50 in 2015. This claim rates Mostly False.

pomt-12199	Wisconsin is "dead-last in creating new businesses" for "three years in a row."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jul/26/andy-gronik/half-true-attack-scott-walker-and-if-wisconsin-3-y/	On the day he announced his run for governor of Wisconsin, Democrat and political newcomer Andy Gronik attacked Republican Gov. Scott Walker in an interview on WTMJ-AM in Milwaukee. The afternoon drive-time host, John Mercure, asked Gronik on July 11, 2017 how he would pay for his proposal to provide free college to needy students who have good grades, and how much Gronik’s idea would cost. The suburban Milwaukee businessman responded by making statistical claims criticizing Walker’s record on jobs, including this one: "We are 50th out of 50 states -- so we're dead last in creating new businesses in the state of Wisconsin for three years in a row." That would be a strong counter to Walker’s frequent boasts about how the state’s unemployment rate has dropped during his time as governor. It’s also a claim Gronik made in two other interviews. Let’s see if he’s right. Counting isn’t necessarily simple It’s worth noting at the top that even a simple count of new businesses isn’t necessarily simple. While running for governor in 2010, Walker promised to create 10,000 new businesses during his first term. Near the end of the term, the number of registered business entities had risen by more than 25,000. But we found the count of registered businesses is a general economic indicator with severe limitations. The count includes not only new ventures that bring new jobs, but thousands of entities with no workers on the payroll at all -- and little if any prospect of hires to come. Those include hundreds of nonprofits such as Scout troops and thousands of limited-liability companies set up by real-estate investors solely to hold ownership of property or properties. As we’ll see, Gronik’s claim also has issues. Gronik’s evidence To back Gronik’s claim, his campaign referred us to a May 2017 news article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on the 2017 Kauffman Index of Startup Activity. The index is produced by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, one of the country’s leading entrepreneurship advocacy and research organizations. Wisconsin did, in fact, rank last among the 50 states in 2015, 2016 and 2017 in startup activity, according to the index. But the Kauffman index is not simply a count of new business creations, which is what Gronik’s claim is about -- it is a combination of three measures that Kauffman thinks are important in assessing startup activity. One measure is the number of startup firms less than a year old that employed at least one person for every 1,000 such businesses in the state. The other two measures are the percentage of adults who become entrepreneurs and the percentage of new entrepreneurs who started businesses primarily because they saw a market opportunity, rather than because they were unemployed. Wisconsin ranked last because its overall index for the three measures (-3.65) was the lowest -- significantly below Alabama, the 49th-ranked state, at -2.69. Nevada ranked No. 1, at 3.22. We found two more narrowly tailored federal data sets that help evaluate Gronik’s statement. BLS rankings When we posed Gronik’s statement to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the agency suggested we look at its data on "establishment births" -- the number of new businesses created in a particular year -- as a percentage of all business establishments in each state. Wisconsin does better on this measure, ranking near the middle. The most recent figures show that for the first three quarters of 2016, new establishments accounted for 6.7 percent of all business establishments in Wisconsin, a rank of 29th, according to our calculations. It ranked 34th in 2015 and 32nd in 2014. Census rankings We were also directed to U.S. Census Bureau data on new businesses that had employees. But it is less useful, given that the latest data is for 2014. For 2014, Wisconsin ranked 44th when considering the percentage of firms in the state that were created during that year. A firm is defined as a business that has one or more establishments. Viewed another way, Wisconsin ranked 46th for the percentage of establishments that were opened in 2014. An establishment is a single location where business is done. (The BLS data is collected from administrative records and cover a wider spectrum of business establishments. The Census data is collected using a survey and covers a more limited set of businesses.) Our rating Gronik said Wisconsin is "dead last in creating new businesses" for "three years in a row." He’s correct when citing the 2015, 2016 and 2017 rankings from the respected nonprofit Kauffman Index on Startup Activity. But that index, while it takes into account what portion of a state’s businesses were created in a given year, also considers two other variables. So, it supports Gronik’s statement only to a point. Conversely, Wisconsin ranked between 29th and 34th for 2014 through 2016, according to the latest figures from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Those rankings are based strictly on the percentage of a state’s business establishments that were created in each year.

pomt-13047	Says climate scientist James Hansen says "we have until perhaps 50 years from now," or maybe a little longer "and at that point, we are looking at 10, 20, 30 feet of sea-level rise."	false	/texas/statements/2016/nov/23/jill-stein/jill-stein-overstates-forecast-about-seas-rising-3/	Presidential candidate Jill Stein told a boisterous Texas crowd that a respected scientist foresees the loss of coastal cities within a half century due to creeping seas. "In this election, we’re not just deciding what kind of a world we will have, but whether we will have a world or not going forward," Stein said Oct. 17, 2016 at a forum at Austin’s Huston-Tillotson University. As of mid-November 2016, with some votes left to be counted, Stein appeared to have drawn about 1 percent nationally in her second run as the presidential nominee of the Green Party, which emphasizes environmental sustainability. Its party platform describes environmentalism and justice as intertwined and calls for "an ecological society that is harmonized with nature." Stein said at the forum: "Jim Hansen, the father of climate science; he hasn’t been wrong yet in about 40 years of climate science. And his latest predictions are that, folks, we have until perhaps 50 years from now — maybe a little bit longer, but maybe not. And at that point, we are looking at 10, 20, 30 feet of sea level rise which means goodbye to population centers on the coasts." Of the nation’s 50 most populous cities, 16 lie in part at sea level, according to the US Geological Survey. The cities include New York, Miami, Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Baltimore, Portland and Seattle. Scientists have attributed sea-level rise to the melting of glaciers and ice caps, caused by the Earth’s warming atmosphere. In July 2013, PolitiFact rated True a claim by U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., that sea levels measured in Florida had risen nine inches since the 1920s, finding corroborating historical data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The agency attributes the rising seas to a combination of thermal expansion (because warm water expands) and melting ice. Then again, nine inches is a whole lot less than 10 to 30 feet. So, did a top climate scientist predict that much of a sea-level rise in about 50 years? We emailed the Stein campaign for the nominee's backup information but didn’t hear back. Otherwise, a Google search led us to think Stein was citing James Hansen, the climate scientist who testified to Congress about global warming in 1988 while he was director of NASA’s Institute for Space Studies; in that testimony, he warned of resultant heat waves and droughts to come, not of rising seas swallowing cities. We noticed too that Stein made a similar claim in an Aug. 10, 2016 Twitter post warning about Americans losing homes due to a nine-foot sea-level rise by 2050. At the time, Stein spokeswoman Meleiza Figueroa said Hansen was the candidate’s source. An Aug. 17, 2016, Washington Post news story went on to characterize the nine-foot figure as a possibility, not a prediction, also saying that the prospect "doesn’t represent a scientific consensus." Hansen’s hypothesis For our part, we emailed Hansen, who works for Columbia University’s Earth Institute, to run Stein’s claim by him. He wrote back that he has forecasted "multi-meter sea level rise" in 50 to 150 years, which he wrote "means loss of most coastal cities." Hansen also pointed us to a study he co-authored with 18 fellow scientists from the U.S., China and Europe, published March 22, 2016, in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics. The 52-page study flatly predicts the 50-to-150 year timeframe for sea-level rise. Yet it ties that expectation to the authors’ hypothesis that polar ice caps will melt drastically faster than what had been estimated by that time by most scientific studies. The study repeatedly warns of potential rise by "several meters," we noticed, but doesn’t have specific figures equal to the 10-to-30 foot range declared by Stein. The study also acknowledges that the data used to test the authors’ hypothesis were imperfect, making the implications uncertain. Researchers, the study says, used "coarse-resolution modeling and simplifying assumptions" and so "raises fundamental questions that point towards specific modeling and measurement needs." It also states "the record is too short to confirm the nature of the response"--meaning there’s too little data to know for sure how quickly the ice caps will melt. We’re sharing next more detail about the basis of the hypothesis and the authors’ related conclusions. The study, drawing on computer models taking into account ancient climate data revealed by ocean sediment cores plus more recent observations of ice melt, ocean currents and global surface temperatures, specifically hypothesizes that the ice caps will melt at an exponential, as opposed to linear, rate. Under that scenario, the study posits, the volume of discharged meltwater would double every 10, 20 or 40 years. Still, the authors note, "the record is too short to confirm" which timeframe will prove out, though limited modern observations put it nearer to 10 years, they say. "If (greenhouse gas) emissions continue to grow" (which they were as of 2011, according to federal data published in 2015), the study says, "multi-meter sea level rise would become practically unavoidable, probably within 50-150 years." The study says: "Social disruption and economic consequences of such large sea-level rise, and the attendant increases in storms and climate extremes, could be devastating. It is not difficult to imagine that conflicts arising from forced migrations and economic collapse might make the planet ungovernable, threatening the fabric of civilization." The Hansen-led study drew wide attention at its debut with some experts saying the conclusions were speculative rather than certain. On March 22, 2016, the New York Times ran a story headlined, "Scientists warn of perilous climate shift within decades, not centuries," and the Post wrote, "We had all better hope these scientists are wrong about the planet’s future." A main point of those news stories: the possibilities raised by Hansen and his co-authors overstepped the accepted spectrum for projected sea-level rise in existing scientific literature. Other sea level forecasts Other prominent predictions: --The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2013 forecasted sea level rise between 0.6 and one meter by 2100. --In 2014, the U.S. National Climate Assessment, a federal project, predicted between one and four feet of sea level rise by the century’s end, about 0.3-1.2 m. --The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, in its plans for incorporating sea level change into civil works construction, holds that "a credible upper bound for 21st Century sea-level rise would not exceed 2 meters. So, Hansen and others indeed made bold predictions. But the predictions were based on a hypothesized phenomenon of exponential ice cap melt. Other researchers Next, we turned to outside experts for interpretation. We looked up Climate Central, a New Jersey-based a New Jersey-based organization of scientists studying climate change, and emailed the head of sea level research there, Benjamin Strauss, to inquire if Hansen’s researcher seemed credible. Asked about Stein’s claim that Hansen hasn’t been wrong in 40 years, Strauss said Hansen "is definitely one of the greatest heroes of climate science, and he has often been prescient, but everyone makes mistakes." Regarding the March 2016 study, Strauss said it "was far outside the mainstream of climate or sea level science. It was very provocative, and coming from him it must be taken seriously, but specialists were and remain extremely skeptical of its projections and conclusions." We wondered what could set Hansen’s conclusions so far apart from the accepted projections. Per our reading, public discussions posted online and other news analyses, it was largely based on a hypothesized snowball effect in ice cap melting. The study said that as freshwater poured off melting polar ice, it would form a cap atop the relatively heavy ocean saltwater; that would suppress vertical currents that bring polar sea water to the surface to cool, thereby warming the ocean subsurface, speeding melting at the deepest levels of the ice caps and increasing the rate of freshwater runoff. When Hansen emailed, he also pointed out the extensive public review process posted online. There, we found commentary from other researchers on the study. Peter Thorne, director of the Irish Climate Analysis and Research Units at Maynooth University in Ireland, left a 12-page review in which he addressed the proposed snowball effect of ice cap melt. The hypothesis, he wrote, "relies to an uncomfortable extent upon a causal chain of the nature given a then b and because b then c and c means that d shall occur etc. Each link in the chain is certainly plausible based upon the relatively scant evidence at hand, but it is not by any stretch determinant." Thorne also wrote: "At the same time, however, it would be foolish in extremis to discount this out of hand as a possibility of what shall occur" because "we do not know enough about the earth system as a whole" and "I share many of the author’s manifestly obvious concerns" about the dangerous implications of a warming climate. Texas state climatologist By email, we ran the densely-worded study by Texas state climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon, a professor of meteorology at Texas A&M University. Nielsen-Gammon replied that the study's mention of sea level rise amounted to more of a "statement of the possible" as opposed to an actual sea-level-rise prediction." He wrote that he read the study and explained that Hansen and the team hypothesized an exponential increase in meltwater discharge, then tested the hypothesis using observed meltwater rates for Greenland and Antarctica. He said the authors "concluded that the observed record was too short to determine whether meltwater discharge is increasing exponentially, let alone what the time scale of increase is, though the data is consistent with their hypothesized rapid exponential increase." Hansen acknowledged as much in a 15-minute video he released in conjunction with the paper on March 21, 2016. Hansen said in the video: "The data records are too short, but if we wait until the real world reveals itself clearly, it may be too late to avoid sea-level rise of several meters and loss of all coastal cities." If the volume of discharged meltwater doubles in ten years, he said in the video, seas could rise one meter in about 50 years; if the volume doubles in 20 years, seas could rise one meter in about 100 years. Our ruling Stein said Hansen predicted 10 to 30 feet of sea-level rise within 50 years or "maybe a little bit longer." Hansen published startling predictions exceeding established forecasts of sea-level rise related to climate change. But even under the most urgent scenario, the Hansen-led study projects about one meter—3.3 feet—of sea-level rise in 50 years. It projects, with some admitted uncertainty, multi-meter sea-level rise within 50 to 150 years. We rate Stein’s claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-15029	"Remember that developers are forced to use the ‘195 land union’ contractors, so tap an extra $10 million into any construction project."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2015/oct/04/john-depetro/depetro-dead-wrong-about-unions-and-195-land/	The demise of the Pawsox’s Providence stadium proposal is a glaring case of union-friendly government policy stifling development, according to John DePetro. The "Red Sox baseball people" — who wanted to build a stadium on 195 land — were "no match for the ‘Allens Avenue’ gang" and they "underestimated the greed of the locals," the WPRO talk show host wrote in his Sept. 20 blog posted on DePetro.com. "Remember that developers are forced to use the `195 land union’ contractors, so tap an extra $10 million into any construction project." Are developers actually required to employ union workers for construction on property created by the relocation of Route 195? And does it cost an "extra $10 million" for "any construction project"? Yes, DePetro said when we reached him, "100 percent true." He told us that a "PLA," a project labor agreement for the development of the 195 land, requires the use of union labor for construction. Just check with the I-195 Redevelopment District Commission, said DePetro, who also said that he would try to provide a copy of the PLA. "I know that it’s in existence." Dyana Koelsch, spokeswoman for the commission, told us the commission is not aware of any requirement that obligates developers to use union labor. At DePetro’s suggestion, we contacted Robert J. Boisselle, president of the Rhode Island chapter of Associated Builders & Contractors, a nationwide association. The association represents 22,000 "open shop" construction companies that function without union labor. And like DePetro, Boisselle’s organization believes that union contractors unnecessarily add to the cost of a construction project, by 12 percent to 18 percent. Boisselle also cited a 2011 research paper produced by the law firm Venable LLP, which looked at projects across the country, including the Big Dig in Boston. But is union labor really required on the former Route 195 property? DePetro is sure of it. Boisselle isn’t sure: "I have not seen a document or a piece of paper that has said any projects down on the 195 land will have a PLA, but I have heard that from many sources." Our next stop was Greg Mancini, executive director of BuildRI, which promotes unionized construction labor. Mancini, who is a lawyer, told us there is "no special legal requirement at the federal, state or local level that mandates" the use of union labor on the former Route 195 land. "There’s absolutely nothing," he said, adding that it would be illegal for either the state or the commission to impose a requirement on developers’ privately owned construction sites. Further, when asked to respond to Boisselle’s comments on union labor costs, Mancini said he would not make a broad statement about the comparative cost of union labor. He said many developers have told his organization that unionized workers completed the job safely, on time and on budget. We also talked to Michael Sabitoni, president of the Rhode Island Building and Construction Trades Council, about DePetro’s statement. "He couldn’t be more misinformed," Sabitoni said. Finally, we doubled back to DePetro, to let him know that the commission says there is nothing that forces developers to hire union labor on the former Route 195 land. DePetro dismissed the information from Koelsch, the commission spokeswoman, pointing to the way the hotel workers’ union has mustered opposition to a new hotel in the Fogarty Building, downtown. "Why? No labor agreement with hotel workers, so no hotel. In theory, one should be able to build a hotel in Providence, but in reality they cannot," he wrote. "I deal in real Rhode Island," he said in an email. "You are buying the Chamber of Commerce BS." Our ruling On his blog, DePetro wrote: "Remember that developers are forced to use the ‘195 land union’ contractors, so tap an extra $10 million into any construction project." DePetro was in Pants on Fire territory. But the state has entered into PLAs in the past. Construction unions are influential and the state can decide to only hire union-labor contractors for work on state land. The I-I95 commission, however, has no such requirement. Because of that, the business about $10 million in extra costs for "any construction project," is irrelevant, in addition to being unsubstantiated in the original version of the blog. So "100 percent true"? Not even close. We rate this ruling False.	None	John DePetro	None	None	None	2015-10-04T00:00:00	2015-09-20	['None']
pomt-09874	"53 percent of Americans cut back on their health care in the last year because of costs."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/30/bill-pascrell/pascrell-says-53-percent-americans-cut-back-health/	The debate over reforming the U.S. health care system has inspired a torrent of often conflicting statistics. We will look at three assertions made by Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey. In this item, we will test his assertion that 53 percent of Americans cut back on their health care in the last year because of costs. On July 28, 2009, Pascrell took to the House floor to counter assertions by Republicans and others that a Democratic bill under consideration in the chamber would lead to the rationing of health care. Pascrell’s larger point was that rationing already exists today, just a different type — thanks to the financial barriers to coverage faced by millions of Americans. Specifically, Pascrell said: “Forty-five percent of Americans went without needed care because of costs in this country in 2007. That’s rationing. Fifty-three percent of Americans cut back on their health care in the last year because of costs. That’s rationing. … As many as 22,000 Americans die each year because they don’t have health insurance. My brothers and sisters, that’s rationing.” We are not going to weigh in on the question of whether it’s fair to equate Pascrell’s examples of “rationing” with what the bill’s critics charge the bill would do if enacted. Rather, we wanted to gauge whether Pascrell’s numbers were sound. So we looked at these three claims individually. Pascrell’s second claim is based on a tracking poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, which is a respected, independent source of data on health policy. Pascrell chose a survey result from February, when the foundation sponsored a poll of 1,204 randomly sampled adults ages 18 and over. All told, 53 percent said that they or a family member in their household had done one of the following things because of cost concerns: relied on home remedies or over-the-counter drugs instead of going to see a doctor (35 percent said yes); skipped dental care or checkups (34 percent); put off or postponed getting health care you needed (27 percent); skipped a recommended medical test or treatment (23 percent); not filled a prescription (21 percent); cut pills in half or skipped doses (15 percent); or had problems getting mental health care (7 percent). What Pascrell or his staff apparently wasn’t aware of was that the same survey has subsequently been repeated three more times — that’s the purpose of a tracking poll, after all — and that, in fact, the percentage of respondents saying they had done one of those things has jumped around quite a bit. In April, the number rose to 59 percent, before falling to 55 percent in June and 49 percent in July. Another point to note: Not all of the actions mentioned to survey respondents are equally damaging, which suggests that the 53 percent figure ought to be taken with a grain of salt. Taking over-the-counter drugs for a temporary condition such as a cold might not be very risky; indeed, for minor illnesses such as colds that doctors aren’t able to treat well anyway, some health care economists would be delighted to see Americans skipping a visit to the doctor. Moreover, the poll data shows that Americans who did scale back their visits seemed to have the right priorities. Of the 27 percent of respondents in the February poll who answered “yes” to the question about putting off needed health care, the two most common items skipped were “a visit to the doctor for a temporary illness, such as a cold or stomach flu” and “preventive care such as a yearly physical exam,” both at 19 percent. Lower rates were recorded for more urgent situations, including a visit for a chronic condition such as diabetes or asthma (10 percent), minor surgery (6 percent) or major surgery (5 percent). Cathy Schoen, a senior vice president with the Commonwealth Fund, agreed that the results on chronic conditions are especially important. “Health plans have started to notice this, as have some employers, and they are lowering cost-shares for essential and effective medications, especially generics,” she said. “Otherwise, plans are seeing an increase in emergency room or hospital visits for complications, which mean higher costs.” Schoen added, “Fortunately most people are healthy each year: The healthiest 50 percent of the population accounts for only 3 percent of all spending. The sickest 10 percent account for 64 percent of all spending. This is where timely and appropriate medical care can make a difference.” Finally, the survey wording raises a bit of a red flag. Pascrell said that 53 percent of Americans “cut back on their health care in the last year because of costs,” a number that reflects anyone who cited one of the seven possible actions offered to respondents. But Pascrell’s statement is not far off from one of those seven offerings, a rather broadly worded question that asked respondents whether they had “put off or postponed getting health care you needed.” That question drew a yes from 27 percent of respondents, well below the 53 percent Pascrell chose to cite. Pascrell accurately conveyed the survey’s topline figure, but he did use old numbers (figures that have varied a bit in subsequent months) and the survey provides other data that make the problem seem less dire than the headline number indicates. We rate his assertion Half True.	None	Bill Pascrell	None	None	None	2009-07-30T17:27:02	2009-07-28	['United_States']
pomt-03672	"Not one dime gets added to the deficit because of Social Security."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/apr/26/mark-pocan/social-security-doesnt-add-federal-deficit-us-rep-/	In a move that upset liberals, President Barack Obama proposed in his 2014 budget a change to something called "chained CPI," which would result in smaller increases in future Social Security benefits. Among those objecting -- at a news conference outside the White House a day before Obama officially made the proposal -- was U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis. The freshman congressman elaborated on his position a week later, in an April 16, 2013 interview with John "Sly" Sylvester, a liberal talk show host on WEKZ-FM (93.7) outside of Madison. And he made this statement: "Social Security didn't cause our deficit. Not one dime gets added to the deficit because of Social Security. It's not allowed to, by law." The one-dime claim -- likely to be repeated in one form or another as Congress debates Obama’s proposal -- is about as absolute as it gets. Is Pocan right? ‘Chained CPI’ Currently, cost-of-living adjustments to Social Security benefits are calculated using the traditional Consumer Price Index, a measure of overall inflation. Obama wants to switch to the so-called chained CPI, which some analysts believe is a more accurate measure. It accounts for how people change their behavior when costs rise -- if the price of pasta goes up, you might buy cheaper rice instead. Chained CPI would save the government some money because it would trigger smaller Social Security benefit increases than the traditional CPI. If chained CPI were put in place in 2014, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the average Social Security benefits would be roughly 2 percent lower -- $30 a month -- by 2023. Pocan’s evidence Pocan, a former state legislator, arrived in Congress in January 2013. He won election to the House seat vacated by Democrat Tammy Baldwin, who ran successfully for the U.S. Senate. To support Pocan’s claim, Pocan spokesman Samuel Lau cited federal documents from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and Congressional Research Service to make two points: 1. Social Security runs a surplus, and therefore doesn’t contribute to the overall federal deficit. 2. Social Security benefits can be paid only from the Social Security trust fund, not general funds. But there is more to the story. Andrew Biggs, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and former principal deputy commissioner of the Social Security Administration, explains it this way: Budget experts use two main measures of the budget deficit: the "on-budget" balance, which includes everything except Social Security and the postal service, and the "unified budget," which merges the on- and off-budgets. The unified budget approach is by far the most common for budget experts and the media -- and when the Obama White House talks about a 2013 budget deficit of $901 billion, it's the unified budget deficit that's being cited. On a unified budget basis, when Social Security's financial position worsens, the budget deficit grows. Social Security contributes about $53 billion to the budget deficit. But let’s go a little deeper, relying on experts such as the Tax Policy Center’s Howard Gleckman and the work of our PolitiFact colleagues and the Washington Post Fact Checker. Social Security’s red ink Although Social Security used to run surpluses, over the past few years it hasn’t collected enough in taxes to pay in benefits. And the trust fund consists not of prior Social Security surplus funds, but of interest-bearing securities provided through federal government borrowing -- thus the link to the deficit. Social Security is a pay-as-you-go system: Payroll taxes paid by current workers and their employers go to pay benefits to current retirees and other Social Security recipients. From 1984 to 2009, Social Security collected more money in payroll taxes than it paid out in benefits. That surplus was transferred from the Social Security program to the federal government's general fund. In return, the Treasury gave Social Security bonds that it could redeem to pay future benefits. The government, in turn, incurred obligations to repay the bonds, plus interest, to the Social Security trust fund. Since 2010, Social Security has been paying more in benefits than it has collected in payroll taxes. To meet its payments, Social Security began redeeming the bonds, plus interest, from the federal government. In other words, money was transferred from the government’s general fund to Social Security. That has an impact on the government’s deficit because the Treasury has had to borrow money in order to make such a transfer. Pocan noted that in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2012, Social Security had a $36 billion surplus. But he ignores the fact that Social Security had to tap its trust fund. A closer look shows that Social Security actually had a cash flow deficit and used roughly $110 billion in interest to help make benefit payments. Because the government had to borrow money in order to pay the interest to Social Security; that contributes to the federal deficit. Indeed, White House figures show the Social Security shortfalls contributing to the overall federal deficit. And Obama has acknowledged that Social Security adds to -- though isn’t the primary driver of -- the deficit. Our rating Pocan is not the first to claim that Social Security does not contribute to the federal government’s budget deficit. Nor even the most recent. Two days after Pocan made his statement, Baldwin said on C-SPAN: "Social Security has not contributed one penny to our current deficit or debt." But unlike Pocan, she noted the government has used "other taxpayer funds" when payroll taxes weren’t enough to pay Social Security benefits. In 2011, 2012 and 2013, our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas, Georgia and New Hampshire examined claims similar to Pocan’s. Each reached the same rating: Mostly False. And that’s what we rate Pocan’s statement.	None	Mark Pocan	None	None	None	2013-04-26T09:00:00	2013-04-16	['None']
pomt-06172	"President Obama has increased the federal workforce 192,000 individuals -- about 10 percent since he’s taken office -- while we’ve lost 2 million jobs."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/dec/15/ron-johnson/sen-ron-johnson-says-obama-has-increased-federal-w/	Continuing a trend that began under President George W. Bush after 9/11, the federal government workforce has grown under President Barack Obama, mostly in defense, homeland security and related agencies. Wisconsin’s junior senator, Republican Ron Johnson, wants to roll back the Obama-era growth by 2015 by not filling positions as people leave or retire. He says it could save $248 billion over a decade. That proposal is part of a $1.4 trillion deficit-cutting plan Johnson presented to the congressional "supercommittee" that haggled over a budget-balancing plan before it reached a stalemate. In the wake of the failure, Johnson argued it shouldn’t be that hard to find savings, especially in the federal worker ranks. "I’m not talking about firing or terminating anybody, but we’ve got about 400,000 workers ready to retire," Johnson said in a Nov. 17, 2011 appearance on Bloomberg television. He added: "President Obama has increased the federal workforce 192,000 individuals, about 10 percent since he’s taken office, while we’ve lost 2 million jobs." Were Johnson’s numbers on target? PolitiFact National has tested many jobs claims. Its gold standard for official jobs figures is the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, considered the official arbiter of U.S. employment numbers. Checking those numbers, we found that it’s accurate that 2 million jobs were lost in the overall private and public sectors (local and state governments dropped considerably). We used a baseline of January 2009, the last partial month of President George W. Bush. What about the federal workforce? Using the same Bureau of Labor Statistics figures, we found a smaller jump in the federal workforce than Johnson claimed -- a 129,900 gain, or 6 percent -- from January 2009 to October 2011. That’s based on preliminary numbers posted as of late November. Where did Johnson get his 192,000 jobs and 10 percent increase? He pointed us to the official executive-branch jobs data kept on the FedScope website by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. The June 2011 FedScope data on civilian jobs -- the latest available when Johnson spoke -- showed 2.137 million federal employees, excluding most of the judicial, legislative and postal jobs. Johnson provided us data for December 2008 -- just before Obama took office -- that he said he obtained privately from the agency. It showed 1.945 million federal jobs. The agency declined to comment on Johnson’s data. An OPM official said the agency did not publicly put out FedScope data for that month. The agency referred us to publicly available September 2008 data, a few months prior, which showed 1.938 million federal jobs. Either starting point gets you to Johnson’s 10 percent increase, about 190,000 jobs added. Another important note: On the federal government growth, most of the increase goes away if you include the U.S. Postal Service, which has shrunk significantly. When you do, the increase is 29,000. PolitiFact has found that both presentations -- postal workers in, postal workers out -- are used and credible. But they measure different things. Some researchers see the quasi-governmental Postal Service as separate; others say it’s still part of the federal government. "If you ignore that fact and say ‘The federal government is growing strongly’ and leave unsaid ‘except the parts that are shrinking fast,’ aren’t you just misleading readers?" asked Gary Burtless, senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. What about Johnson’s data source, FedScope? FedScope is considered reliable and is used by researchers who prefer an actual headcount to the sample-based approach used by BLS. So Johnson is in good company when citing FedScope, which his office views as more precise than the BLS for the federal workforce. Johnson, though, mixes his data sources, and there are other problems with his numbers. If he had stuck with BLS for both numbers, he would gotten a significantly smaller increase in federal jobs -- 6 percent instead of the 10 percent he cited. Plus, the FedScope numbers are not adjusted for seasonal swings, while the BLS data is tweaked for that. It’s impossible to judge the impact of that, but the difference might be notable, based on our review of BLS seasonal and non-seasonal data. In addition, Johnson’s time frame is off in a couple ways. His start date of December 2008 is about a month shy of Bush’s final month. So his figures wrongly attribute a small chunk of federal government growth to Obama. And while his data was the latest available on FedScope, it was not as current as BLS. Our conclusion Despite all that, we found, it’s clear Johnson is on target on the 2 million jobs lost overall, and accurate or very close on the federal workforce trend -- at least using FedScope. But juxtaposing the two numbers invites an apples to oranges comparison because they are from two different data sources. FedScope is credible, but a different animal than the BLS figures, so a lot of clarification of differences is needed to explain the relationship between the two measurements. If Johnson had used the more up-to-date and widely quoted Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers for both calculations, the federal growth trend would have been less dramatic, though still significant. Finally, we’ll note that PolitiFact routinely checks not only the accuracy of jobs numbers, but whether blame or credit is justifiably fixed on the subject of the political claim. For job-creation and job-loss claims, we have noted in the past that politicians’ policies are just one factor in employment levels. That’s true in this case, though the first part of Johnson’s claim -- on federal government growth -- arguably relates in large part to policy decisions by Obama. Bottom line: A generally accurate statement that leaves out some key details. That fits our definition of Half True.	None	Ron Johnson	None	None	None	2011-12-15T09:00:00	2011-12-15	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-12123	Wages "haven’t gone up for a long time."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/aug/17/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-wages-havent-gone-long-time-s-wr/	It was hardly the most widely noticed remark in his Trump Tower lobby question-and-answer session on Aug. 15 -- that would be his comments on the unrest in Charlottesville, Va. But one economic assertion by President Donald Trump caught our attention. As Trump was leaving, a reporter asked him what he thought "needs to be done to overcome the racial divides in this country?" "I really think jobs can have a big impact," Trump said, going on to tout investments by car companies and iPhone manufacturer Foxconn. "I think if we continue to create jobs at levels that I’m creating jobs, I think that’s going to have a tremendous impact, positive impact, on race relations." The reporter then pressed him on how an improved economy would ease race relations. "Because the people are going to be working," Trump said. "They’re going to be making a lot of money, much more than they ever thought possible. That’s going to happen. The other thing, very important: I believe wages will start going up. They haven’t gone up for a long time." Is Trump correct that wages "haven’t gone up for a long time?" Short answer: No. They’re going up now, in fact. While it’s true that wages were stagnant for several years -- especially after the Great Recession -- they have been on an upward swing since early 2014. We put together the following chart showing median, inflation-adjusted weekly earnings for wage and salaried workers, 16 years of age and older, going back to 1979: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com It shows that for much of the time between 2012 and 2014, median weekly earnings were lower than they were in 1979 -- a frustrating disappearance of any wage growth for 35 years. But that began changing in 2014. After hitting a low of $330 a week in early 2014, wages have risen to $354 a week by early 2017. That’s an increase of 7.3 percent over a roughly three-year period. "In this case, you can say the president is flatly wrong," said Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless. "Real wages have been rising more slowly than anyone wishes, except perhaps employers. Nonetheless, they have been rising." Burtless noted that the increases for a subset of all workers -- "production and non-supervisory employees" -- have been occurring for even longer. They’ve gone up every month but two since late 2012. Jed Kolko, the chief economist with the jobs site Indeed.com, added that "not only have wages gone up overall, but wages are now increasing most for people with less education. So, wage gains aren't being driven only by top earners." He provided this chart, showing that non-college full-time employees have been growing by 3 percent to 4 percent a year. The White House did not respond to an inquiry. Our ruling Trump said that wages "haven’t gone up for a long time." That was once accurate, but it’s significantly out of date. Wages have been increasing for the past three to five years, depending on the measurement you use. We rate the statement False.

pomt-15380	"By one leading measure, what business owners pay out in wages and salaries is now finally growing faster than what they spend on health insurance" for the first time in 17 years.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/30/barack-obama/are-wages-finally-growing-faster-health-insurance-/	Even if you’re not a direct beneficiary of Obamacare, you’ve reaped its benefits, said President Barack Obama in response to the Supreme Court’s ruling upholding elements of the Affordable Care Act. "By one leading measure, what business owners pay out in wages and salaries is now finally growing faster than what they spend on health insurance. That hasn't happened in 17 years," he said on June 25. Obama’s point is that employers have been spending more and more on health care, so they couldn’t increase wages. Now, he says, health care costs are reined in, which means workers can get more in their paychecks. We wanted to know if Obama was right that this was the first time this has happened since 1998. The White House told us Obama got his numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Employment Cost Index, which measures changes in employee compensation over time. The data shows that, in the past 17 years, wages grew faster than health care in just one 12-month period, and it was recently: from March 2014 to March 2015. Health care costs grew by 2.5 percent, compared to a 2.6 percent rise in wages. Obama’s claim was specific in looking at the growth in employer health care costs from year to year. Other measures have found similar trends when looking at changes over longer periods of times and employee share of the insurance tab. Bloomberg, for example, bookended a 25-year period and found that health costs for business almost quadrupled from 1987 to 2012, while wages doubled. According to a report from the health care think tank the Commonwealth Fund, between 2003 and 2013, average family premiums jumped 73 percent, while median family income increased by 16 percent. While Obama’s numbers are accurate, experts had a few words of caution. First, it’s too early to tell how big of a role Obamacare played in curbing health care costs. Beyond legislation, experts also count the recession and a slowdown in medical advancements as potential reasons. "I don't think people know the exact relationship between health care costs and Obamacare," said Janet Currie, a professor of labor and health economics at Princeton University. "I think (the claim) is true now. Whether it'll be true next quarter is another matter." Second, because wages and health benefits are typically a zero-sum game, Obama’s purported impact on paychecks could go both ways. "Because of the (law’s) increasing binding tax or penalty on the ‘Cadillac’ insurance plans, some employers may scale back on the generosity of plans and shift compensation towards wages," said Jeffrey Clemens, a professor of health economics at the University of California San Diego. Small firms may be pushed the other way, he said: "If their insurance packages fall short, firms in that position would need to increase benefits and maybe take from wages." Third, less expensive health care isn’t necessarily something to cheer about. It could reflect more bang for your buck and a more efficient system, but if the price reflects the quality of care or access to it, cheaper doesn’t mean better, said Clemens. Our ruling Obama said, "by one leading measure, what business owners pay out in wages and salaries is now finally growing faster than what they spend on health insurance" for the first time in 17 years, and he credited the Affordable Care Act. His claim is backed by numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that compare change in costs over a 12-month period: Wages grew faster than health care costs for the first time since 1998 between March 2014 and March 2015. Experts say Obama used the BLS data accurately and reasonably. They did caution that the law's role in this dynamic is still uncertain, and more data may show different results. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2015-06-30T11:36:30	2015-06-25	['None']
pomt-10240	Joe Biden "voted against the first Gulf War. He opposed the surge. He wanted to partition Iraq."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/01/lindsey-graham/only-as-a-last-resort/	John McCain's campaign readily acknowledges Joe Biden's expertise in national security matters. But that isn't stopping McCain surrogates from questioning the Democratic vice presidential nominee's judgment, especially when it comes to Iraq policy. McCain ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., raised the issue in an Aug. 31, 2008, interview on ABC News' This Week, implying that Biden lacked the backbone to stand up to powerful foes or to fix broken governments. "He has national security experience. But experience and judgment need to come together. He voted against the first Gulf War. He opposed the surge. He wanted to partition Iraq," Graham said in response to a statement about Biden's national security experience. As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Biden indeed opposed the troop buildup and called for separating Iraq into three autonomous provinces — Shiite, Sunni and Kurd. We've previously checked his Iraq policy in this story and in this ruling. But what of his opposition to the first Gulf War? It turns out Biden, with the majority of Senate Democrats, did oppose a 1991 congressional resolution authorizing the use of force following Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. The question of whether to commit troops was the first decision the 102nd Congress faced upon convening in January 1991. In spite of diplomatic initiatives that followed Iraq's invasion, the elements of a major war were in place by Jan. 1: nearly 1-million troops poised along either side of Kuwait's border with Saudi Arabia; the U.N. authorization for member nations to "use any means necessary" to secure Iraq's removal after Jan. 15; and Hussein's unwavering position that he would hold on to his conquest. Congress was put in the position of making a firm and formal stand. Democratic leaders spurned President George H.W. Bush's request for an open-ended vote of support and urged members to delay any action on the crisis, lest it undermine a final attempt at a diplomatic solution. Nonetheless, the Senate began debate on Jan. 4. On Jan. 12, a sharply divided Congress authorized the president to go to war — the first time since World War II that Congress directly confronted the issue of sending large numbers of American troops into combat. The joint resolution authorized the president "to use United States Armed Forces" to enforce a Nov. 29, 1990, U.N. Security Council ultimatum that Iraq withdraw troops from Kuwait. The resolution put no time limit on the use of American force if Iraq failed to live up to the U.N.-imposed conditions. The Senate voted 52-47 to authorize the use of force, with Biden among those voting no. Ten Democrats joined with virtually unanimous Republicans in support of the resolution. Minutes later, the House approved identical legislation by a vote of 250-183. Most of the Democratic opponents argued that war should be only a last resort, and insisted that the administration and its allies should have waited months — and maybe as long as a year — on the expectation that the pressure from economic sanctions would eventually force Iraq to withdraw. That view was endorsed by some scholars and former Pentagon officials who had testified before congressional committees, but was emphatically disputed by others. As the vote approached, Biden expressed concern about the United States bearing an undue burden of the military operations, and derided other nations in the anti-Iraq coalition, calling it, "a coalition that has allowed us to take on 95 percent of the sacrifice across the board." The vote represented the thinnest congressional margin backing military action since the War of 1812. And senators split the same way on a resolution offered prior to the use of force measure by Majority Leader George J. Mitchell of Maine and Armed Services Committee chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., that demanded a continued reliance on economic sanctions. That resolution was defeated 46-53, with Biden voting in favor. On the campaign trail, Biden makes the case that he has the requisite toughness to go head-to-head with foreign leaders. As an example, he points to a 1993 encounter with Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic duiring the Balkan wars in which he called Milosevic a war criminal to his face. But Biden's two votes on the eve of war in 1991 clearly show he favored continued economic sanctions over the use of military force. For this reason, we rule Graham's statement True.

pomt-07004	"China owns more of our bonds than do Americans."	false	/virginia/statements/2011/jul/08/george-allen/allen-says-china-owns-more-us-bonds-americans/	Republican Senate candidate George Allen said recently that the U.S. is indebted to China, and not in a good way. "China owns more of our bonds than do Americans," Allen said in a July 2 interview with the NBC 29 television station in Charlottesville. "That’s not a good position to be in." Are China’s holdings of U.S. government debt larger than the amount Americans own? We checked to see if that was true. The national debt stands at $14.3 trillion. Nearly $6 trillion of that is held by the Federal Reserve and U.S. government agencies in various funds such as the Social Security Trust Fund. The rest of the amount, about $8.3 trillion, is "privately-held" debt owed to mutual funds, pension funds, foreign investors and other bond holders. There’s no doubt China holds a lot of U.S. government debt. In fact, it’s the largest foreign owner of U.S. Treasury securities. As of March 2011, China owned about $1.2 trillion of U.S. debt - more than a quarter of the total $4.5 trillion in U.S. treasuries held by foreign investors, according to statistics from the U.S. Treasury Department. But the rest of the roughly $3.8 trillion of privately held debt was owned by United States investors such as banks, pension funds and mutual funds. So there’s no way that China owns more U.S. debt than domestic investors. But Bill Riggs, an Allen campaign spokesman, told us that when the former governor said China held more bonds than Americans, he was referring to debt held by ordinary American investors. To support that narrower contention, the Allen campaign sent us a couple of reports from the U.S. Treasury to argue that regular American investors’ U.S. debt holdings were less than China’s. Allen’s campaign pointed to an April 2011 Treasury report showing the June 2010 amount of foreign holdings of U.S. securities, which includes treasury securities as well as other investments including stocks and debt owed by U.S. agencies.According to the report, China had $1.6 trillion of U.S. securities. Riggs then sent us a Treasury Department table showing the breakdown of how much U.S. Treasuries are held by various classes of investors. That chart breaks out holders of U.S. treasuries into about 10 groups such as U.S. banks, savings bonds, pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds, foreign investors, state and local governments and a miscellaneous "other investors" category. Riggs said the campaign tallied up the total debt held by what Allen termed American investors. Allen’s campaign included debt tied up in U.S.savings bonds, private pension funds, state and local government pensions and mutual funds. Investors in those funds held a total of $1.5 trillion of debt in June 2010, Riggs said. The Allen campaign did not include in its calculations U.S. Treasury debt held by banks, insurance companies, state and local governments outside their pension funds or tallies from the "other investors" category. That $1.5 trillion tally that Allen attributes to American investors is less than the $1.6 trillion attributed to China in Treasury’s April report. But there are serious flaws with the Allen campaign’s reasoning. First of all, Allen’s rationale is an apples-to-oranges comparison. The smaller $1.5 trillion tally for so-called American investors only includes U.S. Treasury securities. But the larger $1.6 trillion tally linked to China includes not just Treasury debt, but other investments a well -- such as stocks and corporate debt. Derek Scissors, an economist who specializes in Asian affairs at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said the two numbers are not measuring the same thing. "It’s not a comparable number," Scissors said. "They’re trying to build a skewed case." Scissors was also skeptical of how the Allen campaign defined debt held by regular American investors. If the Allen campaign was going to count debt held by mutual funds, Scissors wondered why they didn’t include debts held by U.S. banks. Scissors also said some portion of the "other investors" category, which held $1.2 trillion of U.S. treasury debt in June 2010, would certainly include some debt owned by Americans. But Allen’s calculations for American-held debt doesn’t count a penny of debt held in that category, which includes debt held by individuals, government-sponsored enterprise and businesses. For the record, we checked a pair of Treasury Department charts to get the latest official tally of how much U.S. treasury securities were owned by China. As of December 2010 -- the most recent month for which we could find comparable data -- mainland China and Hong Kong (which are reported separately) together held nearly $1.3 trillion in U.S. Treasury securities. In that same month, the investor categories comprising Allen’s definition of regular investors held $1.6 trillion in U.S. securities. To sum up: Allen said China owns more U.S. bonds than Americans. That statement is wrong on its face, but the Allen campaign offers a qualifier -- his spokesman said Allen’s statement is a reference to regular American investors. But the reports Allen cites are not comparable and don’t even prove that narrower assertion. Official debt tallies, even using Allen’s definition of ordinary American investors, show U.S. citizens held more government debt than China. As an added defense, Allen’s campaign said Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke in February testified before Congress that he thinks China owns more than $2 trillion of U.S. government bonds. That still doesn’t prove Allen’s point. The bottom line is that Allen’s methodology of including some U.S. investors and ignoring others is highly questionable, and his evidence doesn’t add up to his conclusion. We rate the claim False.

pomt-04218	"In the past year alone, Ohio businesses have created more jobs than almost every other state in the country."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/nov/29/jobs-ohio/jobs-ohio-claims-buckeye-state-nearly-tops-new-job/	The nasty political ads have been gone for weeks, but the launch of a marketing campaign aimed at trumpeting Ohio’s improving economy offers a preview of the next great election battle. JobsOhio, the state’s private economic development agency, is on air with a 30-second commercial that celebrates workers of all stripes and conveys an optimistic message. The agency is the brainchild of Republican Gov. John Kasich, who has ridden Ohio’s rising fortunes to rising poll numbers. And the "Thrive in Ohio" spot, which also asks viewers to share their success stories on a web site, has rankled Democrats hoping to unseat Kasich in 2014. Never mind that the spot doesn’t feature Kasich or identify him or the governor’s office in any way. Democrats see a calculated political move bankrolled by state development money. The push also includes print advertising and will cost $1.4 million, the Columbus Dispatch reported. Cuyahoga County Executive Ed FitzGerald, one potential challenger to Kasich, has publicly called on Kasich to suspend the campaign, declaring it a waste of taxpayer dollars. Given the dust-up surrounding the JobsOhio blitz and the role the state’s economy is sure to play in the gubernatorial race, PolitiFact Ohio decided to evaluate the claim central to the TV spot. "In the past year alone, Ohio businesses have created more jobs than almost every other state in the country," an unseen narrator says, his words scored to an inspirational piano melody. "And it’s only the beginning." So how does the statement stack up when peeled away from such slick marketing? Laura Jones, communications director for JobsOhio, cited employment data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Via email, Jones said the numbers showed that from October 2011 through October 2012, only California, Texas and New York created more jobs than Ohio. Jones referred us to the bureau’s Regional and State Employment and Unemployment report. According to seasonally adjusted employment numbers in October, 30 states reported statistically significant increases in employment year-over-year -- Ohio among them. Table E, found on page seven of the 21-page report, breaks down the employment trends by state. Since October 2011, according to preliminary data, Ohio has added 96,500 jobs. Indeed, that increase ranks fourth, behind the more-populated California, Texas and New York. Because the report was dated Nov. 20, three days after JobsOhio posted the commercial to YouTube, PolitiFact Ohio went back to look at the previous month’s report, which evaluated the period from September 2011 and September 2012. We found the Buckeye State in the same position: fourth among states with statistically significant employment increases. We also checked with George Zeller, an economic research analyst from Cleveland. He was familiar with the Thrive in Ohio campaign and, after paging through the BLS reports agreed that the numbers cited by JobsOhio were legitimate. But what do the numbers prove? "What they’re saying there is that Ohio’s No. 4," Zeller said. "What you have to recognize is that of course we’re going to gain more jobs than Vermont, because Vermont is smaller. There are 50 states, so being fourth is higher than others. But we’re by no means at the top." Zeller makes a valid point. Ohio, by virtue of being one of the nation’s most populous states, is destined to have and add more jobs than smaller states. Ohio is the seventh-most populous state, according to Census figures, ranking behind California, Texas, New York, Florida, Illinois and Pennsylvania. In terms of jobs added, Ohio is up there with other highly populated states. Zeller also noted that Ohio’s recovery, while real, is coming slowly. At current pace, said Zeller, citing his research, it will take the state 11 years to recover all jobs lost during the recession. "There’s nothing untrue about what [JobsOhio] said," Zeller continued via telephone. "Now does that mean that we are outstripping the rest of the country? No. First of all, because we lost more jobs than the rest of the country did … we have to do a lot more to make them up." Of course Democrats will come armed with other numbers as the gubernatorial fight nears. They often cite BLS data that show the state’s unemployment rate began dropping in early 2010, under Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland and and Democratic President Barack Obama. To their point, it’s worth noting that public policy set outside Ohio affects the state’s economy. Exhibit A: The federal government’s bailout of the U.S. auto industry, a huge Ohio employer. As such, Democrats argue that Ohio was en route to economic recovery months before Kasich defeated Strickland in the November 2010 election. Ironically, Kasich’s constant ballyhooing of these improved prospects was at odds with the message pushed by Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and might have helped Obama’s re-election bid this year. Now that the race for the White House in the rearview mirror, it is no surprise that Democrats see the JobsOhio commercial as the unofficial kickoff of Kasich’s re-election campaign. Perhaps that makes this the unofficial kickoff of PolitiFact Ohio’s monitoring of the contest, whether it’s FitzGerald, Strickland or another candidate who takes on the incumbent governor in 2014. For its Thrive in Ohio campaign, JobsOhio said businesses here "have created more jobs than almost every other state in the country" over the last year. A second later, the ad’s narrator added: "And it’s only the beginning." That qualifier is appropriate given the perspective Zeller supplied. Considering Ohio’s size, a statement about the state’s comparatively high level of job creation is not the ultimate benchmark of success. JobsOhio seems to realize this. On the Truth-O-Meter, the agency’s statement rates True.	None	Jobs Ohio	None	None	None	2012-11-29T06:00:00	2012-11-17	['Ohio']
pomt-11287	Says Jacky Rosen promised "to repeal middle-class tax cut."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/24/dean-heller/middle-class-tax-cuts-weapon-nevada-senate-race/	In his re-election bid, U.S. Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., argued that his leading Democratic opponent wants to take away tax cuts for working families. Heller’s campaign announced its latest attack on Rep. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., in a press release on tax filing day. "Heller campaign releases new digital ad on Jacky Rosen’s reckless promise to repeal middle-class tax cut," the campaign wrote on April 17. The Heller campaign ad consists mainly of broadcast clips of reporters giving examples of companies that announced bonuses and raises for workers. But it closes by saying Rosen "wants the tax bill repealed," and includes a clip of a newscaster saying "Nevada Congresswoman Jacky Rosen wants the recently passed GOP tax bill repealed." The Heller campaign said that report was about a Las Vegas event held by the advocacy group Not One Penny. The event was part of a nationwide protest against the Republican-backed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and Rosen participated. The group billed the national action as the "Repeal the Trump Tax Tour," saying the new tax law "will raise taxes for 92 million middle-class families, rip health care away from 13 million people, and threaten life-saving programs — all to give tax breaks to millionaires, billionaires, and wealthy corporations." According to the Tax Policy Center, a project of the Urban Institute and Brookings, 90 percent of middle-income households would pay less in 2018, but those savings largely disappear by 2027, except for the top 1 percent of earners. For its stop in Las Vegas on Jan. 15, 2018, the group called on Republicans to "repeal the Trump Tax on middle-class Families," as the group’s press release put it. We watched the full video of the event. Rosen left no room for doubt that she opposed the Republican tax cuts. "This tax bill at its core is a giveaway to special interests and the wealthy," Rosen said. "And it will disadvantage millions of working families in the long run. In 10 years, by 2027, more than half of all Americans will pay more in their tax bill." Rosen said the bill was "out of balance," but stopped short of calling for full repeal. "We must come together to use common sense to fix this reckless tax bill and protect our families against long-term damage," Rosen said. While the news report quoted in the Heller ad said she called for repeal, Rosen herself didn’t say that. A search of the Nexis news database and of Rosen’s Twitter accounts reveals no mention. Nor could the Heller campaign provide any examples. Heller campaign spokesman Keith Schipper said, "Rosen never made it a point to say she just wanted to change part of it and keep other parts." In a March 27 op-ed, Rosen said she supports middle-class tax cuts and chastised Heller. "If Sen. Heller and Republicans had really wanted to give a tax cut to working families, why not give them a bigger, permanent tax cut directly instead of relying on trickle-down economics?" she wrote. Our ruling Heller said that Rosen promised to repeal middle-class tax cuts. The Republican tax law provides immediate tax relief to middle-class families, though those savings expire without further action for all but the highest earners. Rosen spoke at an event that called for repeal of what they called the "Trump Tax" on the middle class. However, Rosen said the law should be fixed; she did not say it should be repealed. As a point of policy, both Rosen and the organizers of the event where she spoke support middle-class tax cuts, but not the package passed by Republicans. There’s some nuance here, but Rosen didn’t vow to repeal the current tax law. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-01018	"Common welfare programs give income of $43,330 or $20.83 an hour."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2015/feb/01/rhode-island-center-freedom-and-prosperity/do-common-welfare-programs-pay-equivalent-2083-hou/	Rhode Island's minimum wage just rose to $9 an hour. There's a push by Democrats to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10. That’s chump change if you believe a Jan. 10 tweet by the Rhode Island Center for Freedom and Prosperity. It said you can earn the equivalent of $20.83 an hour by not working and being on welfare. The conservative think tank reported: "RI should make working more attractive than welfare! Common welfare programs give income of $43,330 or $20.83 an hour." That struck us as very attractive. We wondered if it were true. First we asked the center's CEO, Mike Stenhouse, if there were any important caveats omitted from the tweet, which is restricted to 140 characters. With more characters available, he said in an email, the statement would have been something like: "Estimating the combined value of certain public assistance programs available in Rhode Island, common welfare programs can give recipients a pretax income equivalent of up to $43,330 or $20.83 an hour." Neglecting to say "up to" and "equivalent to" are important omissions. So the $43,330 represents the maximum value of the benefits, not actual cash income that recipients can spend as they wish. The source for the claim, said Stenhouse, is a report from the libertarian Cato Institute called "The Work Versus Welfare Trade-Off: 2013." It examined the value of various welfare programs by state. The Rhode Island total comes from starting with the $6,648 a year in cash welfare that a single parent with two children could receive, which is the only unrestricted cash that recipients would see. (It's also 34 percent less than what recipients got in 1995, adjusted for inflation, according to Cato.) Then you add in $6,249 per year in food stamps (now called the SNAP program), $12,702 in housing subsidies, $11,302 as the cost of buying health care coverage comparable to Medicaid, $275 in heating assistance, $300 a year under the Emergency Food Assistance program (TEFAP), and $1,156 in food under the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program for pregnant women, new mothers and children up to age 5. The total -- $38,632 -- is equivalent to what a single parent with two children would get to keep after taxes if the parent earned $43,330 a year, or $20.83 an hour for a 40-hour work week, Cato said. "Many welfare recipients, even those receiving the highest level of benefits, are doing everything they can to find employment and leave the welfare system," the Cato report concludes. "Still, it is undeniable that for many recipients -- especially long-term dependents -- welfare pays more than the type of entry-level job that a typical welfare recipient can expect to find. As long as this is true, many recipients are likely to choose welfare over work." But there's a problem: There's nothing typical about this amount because very few poor people are eligible for -- or take advantage of -- all these programs. The Cato report acknowledges that most people won't be getting close to the $38,632. For example, welfare recipients aren't eligible for WIC benefits unless they have children under age 5. Another example: Many poor people can't get a housing subsidy -- only 1 in 4 Rhode Islanders receiving cash welfare are also receiving housing assistance. Anticipating such criticism, Cato did another calculation, looking only at the welfare, food stamp and Medicaid programs that, they said, nearly all poor people would be eligible for. Cato found that the value of just those benefits was equivalent to being paid $17,347 a year, or $8.34 an hour. That's a far cry from $20.83 an hour. On the other hand, $8.34 an hour is still only 66 cents below the current Rhode Island minimum wage, with no need to punch a time clock, find child care, or arrange for transportation to and from a job. It's not clear how many welfare recipients are actually enrolled in the food stamp and Medicaid programs. Cato, the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the Economic Progress Institute, a liberal think tank at Rhode Island College that studies poverty and other economic issues, didn't have that number. Finally, the Rhode Island Center for Freedom and Prosperity uses the value of the benefits to argue that the state "should make working more attractive than welfare." But Linda Katz, policy director of the Economic Progress Institute, argued there's already a huge incentive to working instead of being on welfare. She said a family of three, with the parent earning $13 per hour, can still receive food stamps, heating assistance, housing assistance and other benefits that Cato values at $28,000. "Instead of having $6,000 in your welfare check, you have $27,000 in your paycheck. And you still keep everything else," she said. That's not true, said Justin Katz (no relation), the Center for Freedom and Prosperity’s research director. The food stamp allotment, for example, would be cut dramatically for someone making $13 an hour full time. We confirmed that with the state's SNAP administrator. A single mother at that pay level would not even be eligible for food stamps unless other expenses were taken into account. With monthly bills of $1,000 in rent, $60 in utility costs, and a friend or relative caring for the children, that mother would get about $2,000 in food stamps per year, far less than the $6,000 she would get if she has no income. The same with a housing subsidy. A single mother in Providence making $13 an hour would potentially be paying $8,112 a year for subsidized housing (if she could get it). That same mother with no income would have to pay just $600 a year for that apartment, according to Michael V. Milito, deputy assistant director of Rhode Island Housing. In a subsequent email, Linda Katz acknowledged that she had erred. Our ruling The Rhode Island Center for Freedom and Prosperity tweeted that "Common welfare programs give income of $43,330 or $20.83 an hour." It's not income as most people think of it. It's how much a poor single parent with two children under age 5 would have to earn to get the equivalent value of all programs, including food stamps, medical care, heating assistance and housing subsidies, plus $6,648 a year in cash assistance. But that's a hypothetical maximum that only a small fraction of welfare recipients reach because they're not eligible for those specific benefits, they didn't apply for them, or a benefit is not available. The Center’s tweet suggests the scenario is more common than it is. It could have added the caveats and still stayed within Twitter’s 140-character limit. For example: "RI should make working more attractive than welfare! Common welfare programs give income up to $43,330 or $20.83/hr for single parent of 2." Because the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

That’s because men who have sex with men still face the greatest risk of getting the disease and represent most new cases. But out of the spotlight, how are women faring? "HIV/AIDS among women is skyrocketing in Austin," Austin City Council Member Ora Houston told council colleagues Sept. 8, 2015, "and we need to do some specific targeting for that." Houston, who represents District 1, sought an additional $150,000 in spending in the 2015-16 budget year for the Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department’s HIV/AIDS initiatives. Houston’s ask was made in the context of bolstering efforts aimed at improving the quality of life of African-Americans in Austin, an initiative the city launched several years ago. The proposal didn’t win council approval, although the department drew a 16-percent surge in its overall budget. Also, it turns out, Houston wasn’t right about HIV and AIDS among Austin women "skyrocketing." Yet for decades and across the nation, African-Americans have been the racial group hardest hit--with black women the most disproportionately affected. It’s a wide gap that similarly persists in Travis County. Houston says she misspoke Houston, asked how she reached her "skyrocketing" declaration, told us by phone she misspoke. "The larger issue is what do we do to save the women in my community infected with HIV/AIDS," she said. Some background: In Travis County, fewer than one in 10 residents is black, but more than one in five of the 4,401 residents living with HIV at the end of 2014 was black, according to health department data. Also that year, nearly 711 in every 100,000 black females living in the county, or 318 individuals, had the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS. That was double the number of Hispanic females (156) and nearly triple the number of white females (109) living with HIV. From another vantage point, the rate of black females living with HIV in Travis County was over 17 times higher than the rate for white females and nearly nine times higher than the rate for Hispanic females. There were still many more men, of all races, with HIV. The rate of black males living in the county with HIV was 1,589.4 per 100,000 in 2014, reflecting 670 individuals. The rates were 634.9 for white males (1,743 people) and 617.8 for Hispanic males (1,235 individuals). Put another way, the rate of black males living with HIV/AIDS in Travis County was 2.5 times higher than the rate for white or Hispanic males. A national pattern The disparity in rates of African American women getting infected with HIV or diagnosed with AIDS, which has deepened since the epidemic began, is rooted in a variety of factors, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office on Women’s Health. A key factor is poverty, which is more widespread in the African-American community and can result in less access to care and, often, a failure to know one’s HIV status. Also, the office says, because African-Americans tend to have sex with partners of the same race, and because the disease is higher in that population, their risk of getting HIV is greater. "Stigma, fear, discrimination, homophobia and negative perceptions about HIV testing can also place too many African-American women at higher risk," the Office on Women’s Health says. "Many at risk for infection fear stigma more than infection. They may choose instead to hide their high-risk behavior rather than get counseling and testing." No skyrocket among Travis County women In Travis County, annual diagnoses of HIV and AIDS for women mostly declined from 2005 through 2014, health department figures show. Most recently, 4 in 100,000 female residents in the county were newly diagnosed with HIV in 2014 compared to an average 6.1 incidence rate from 2005 through 2013. The AIDS incidence rate for all women in the county was 1.9 per 100,000 women in 2014 compared to an average 4.3 rate from 2005 through 2013. Women of all races represented a small number of Travis County residents diagnosed with HIV in 2014: just 23 of the 244 cases. Also in 2014, 98 Travis County residents, including 11 females, were diagnosed with full-blown AIDS. We did not learn how many black females fell into these categories. Health department staff epidemiologist Jeff Taylor advised us by phone that because very few women are diagnosed with HIV/AIDS each year, the department doesn't publicly release raw numbers based on by race and ethnicity. "Some of those numbers may be one, two, three or four, and people get concerned about confidentiality," Taylor said. We were, however, able to compare rates among racial and ethnic groups for a decade. Each year, from 2005 through 2014, the rates of HIV and AIDS among African-American males and females in Travis County was higher than the rates among Hispanics and whites. The far higher rates in black females, when compared to Hispanic and white females, are "startling," Shannon Jones III, director of the city/county health department, said at a recent conference on health disparities. Then again, the data show a 27 percent drop in new HIV diagnoses for black females between 2013 and 2014, though there was an increase in AIDS diagnoses; the incidence of 16 black females per 100,000 black women was up from 12.3 in 2013. Between 2013 and 2014, HIV rates also fell for white females but ticked up among Hispanic females from 3.2 per 100,000 in 2013 to 3.7 per 100,000 in 2014. New diagnoses of HIV are the best barometer of how the disease is trending in a community, Taylor said. Between 2005 and 2014, the rate of new HIV infections for black females in the county ranged from a high of 42.9 per 100,000 black women in 2006 to a low of 19.4 in 2011. Our ruling Houston said HIV/AIDS among women is skyrocketing in Austin. That’s not so. While black women have persistently been diagnosed with HIV/AIDS at higher rates than other women, HIV/AIDS incidence rates for Travis County women declined for most of the past decade.

pomt-15293	President Barack Obama "said at the beginning of the negotiations that the basic approach was to dismantle Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for dismantling the sanctions."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/22/tom-cotton/was-obamas-goal-beginning-negotiations-dismantle-i/	In the wake of the newly completed Iran nuclear agreement, a number of Republicans have charged that the Obama administration has struck a deal that they see as dangerous and inadequate. Among them is freshman Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., a frequent critic of Obama’s foreign policy. In an appearance on CNN on July 15, Cotton lamented what he saw as a weak agreement: "He (Obama) said at the beginning of the negotiations that the basic approach was to dismantle Iran's nuclear program in exchange for dismantling the sanctions. In fact, we are going to keep Iran's nuclear program in place. In fact, Western countries are going to help Iran develop advanced capabilities." We decided to check the claim that the administration’s original intent was to dismantle Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for dismantling the sanctions. Which nuclear program? Since Iran has long asserted that it has a right to pursue nuclear energy -- as distinct from nuclear weapons -- a key question for us was whether the term "nuclear program" referred narrowly to nuclear weapons or more broadly to any kind of nuclear research, including nuclear energy. It’s easy to see how a speaker could say "nuclear program" when they actually intended to say "nuclear weapons program." The answer, according to Cotton’s staff, is that the senator was referring to the nuclear program as a whole, not simply the weapons program. Cotton’s staff also pointed PolitiFact to some quotes from Obama’s 2012 presidential debate against Mitt Romney to back up their claim. In the debate, Obama boasted of the success of sanctions in paving a way forward for negotiations: "The work that we’ve done with respect to sanctions now offers Iran a choice. They can take the diplomatic route and end their nuclear program or they will have to face a united world and a United States president, me, who said we’re not going to take any options off the table," he said. He alluded to Iran either giving up or ending their nuclear program — he didn’t specify that he was referring to the Iranian nuclear weapons program — two more times during the debate. However, this wouldn’t have been, as Cotton said, "at the beginning of negotiations" -- the first meeting between Secretary of State John Kerry and his Iranian counterparts was held on Sept. 26, 2013. (Here's a detailed timeline.) So we decided to see if we could find some stronger evidence. As it happens, a pro-Israel group, the Israel Project, also made a statement much like Cotton’s, and a spokeswoman pointed us to several pieces of evidence. One is a remark by Kerry before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Dec. 10, 2013, right around the time negotiations were kicking into gear. "But I don’t think that any of us thought we were just imposing these sanctions for the sake of imposing them. We did it because we knew that it would hopefully help Iran dismantle its nuclear program. That was the whole point of the regime." Upon examining the full context of Kerry’s speech, however, it becomes clear that Kerry was not referring to the strategy of the White House, but rather to his own time in the Senate, and he seems to reflect the mind-set he and his fellow senators had toward sanctions. "I will tell you that in my 29 years, just about shy of the full 29 I’ve served in the Senate, I was always a leading proponent of the sanctions against Iran. I’m proud of what we did here. But it was undeniable that the pressure we put on Iran through these sanctions is exactly what has brought Iran to the table today, and I think Congress deserves an enormous amount of credit for that," said Kerry. Only then does he add, "But I don’t think that any of us thought we were just imposing these sanctions for the sake of imposing them. We did it because we knew that it would hopefully help Iran dismantle its nuclear program. That was the whole point of the regime." The Israel Project also pointed us to a comment by Wendy Sherman, the under secretary of state for political affairs, during a PBS interview on Dec. 4, 2013. Asked whether a comprehensive agreement will "include dismantling, full dismantling," Sherman replied, "This includes a lot of dismantling of their infrastructure … At the end of the day, what is critical here is that the international community and the United States of America must have full confidence that Iran truly has a peaceful program." But Sherman’s statement refers to "a lot of dismantling," which is short of a full dismantling. Contrary evidence Perhaps the most definitive refutation of Cotton’s claim comes from Obama himself, in an appearance on Dec. 7, 2013, at a Middle East policy forum -- again, right around when the negotiations were starting. "If we could create an option in which Iran eliminated every single nut and bolt of their nuclear program and forswore the possibility of ever having a nuclear program, and for that matter got rid of all its military capabilities, I would take it. But I want to make sure everybody understands it — that particular option is not available. So as a consequence, what we have to do is make a decision as to, given the options available, what is the best way for us to (ensure) Iran does not get a nuclear weapon?" This suggests that the Obama administration was focused not on completely eliminating the Iranian nuclear program, but rather on blocking the pathway to a nuclear weapon. "It has not been the goal of the George W. Bush administration or the Obama administration to completely dismantle every aspect of their nuclear program," said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, a group that aims to educate the public on arms control policy. He added, "Look at the context — (the U.S.) goal is to dismantle, curtail, reduce, to the point (Iran) cannot acquire a nuclear weapon. Nobody is arguing about completely eliminating the nuclear program." The time element of Cotton’s claim is one of its most problematic features. If Cotton had been referring to statements Obama made before he was president, he would have had a better argument, experts say. "There’s a difference between what the president has said about the nuclear program while he was in the process of trying to get elected and comments that he has made when trying to garner support in Congress and then today, when trying to explain what he has," said Richard Brennan, a political scientist at the Rand Corp. Brennan pointed us to a March 2007 speech Obama made in Chicago to the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel group. In his remarks, Obama said, "The world must work to stop Iran’s uranium enrichment program and prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons." Uranium enrichment is a key component of any nuclear program, not simply a nuclear weapons program, so this could be interpreted as Obama talking about more than simply preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. On balance, Brennan agreed with other experts we checked with that, on its face, Cotton’s statement "was probably not accurate." By the time negotiations seriously began in late 2013, the administration had changed its position to ensuring primarily that Iran did not have a nuclear weapon. Our ruling Cotton said that Obama "said at the beginning of the negotiations that the basic approach was to dismantle Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for dismantling the sanctions." In 2007 or even as late as 2012, that might have been true, though believing so requires some careful parsing of the words and intentions of Obama and his advisers. Still, by late 2013 -- the negotiation period Cotton specifically referred to -- the administration had settled on a strategy of blocking a pathway to a nuclear weapon, rather than eliminating any trace of nuclear activities in Iran, including energy. On Dec. 7, 2013, Obama himself explicitly repudiated the idea that it would be possible to fully dismantle "every single nut and bolt of their nuclear program." We rate Cotton’s statement False.

pomt-04886	Says Georgia ranks "near the bottom in per capita transportation spending."	true	/georgia/statements/2012/aug/07/stacey-abrams/does-georgia-have-pothole-transportation-spending/	The morning after the Atlanta area overwhelmingly said no to a 1 percent sales tax to fund more than 150 transportation projects across the region, one prominent leader said that her fellow state lawmakers now needed to take the lead on the issue. "Georgia has under-invested in our transportation network for years, and we rank near the bottom in per capita transportation spending," House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, an Atlanta Democrat, said in a press release. PolitiFact Georgia wondered if the state representative was correct. Or do we need to put a "stop" sign in front of Abrams before she repeats this claim again? As we began our research, PolitiFact Georgia found several officials making similar claims, including the state’s Transportation Department. "Georgia is the 6th fastest growing state in the nation, yet 49th in per capita spending on transportation," said a May 16 press release from the state agency about bridge replacements over Lake Lanier. A spokeswoman for the state’s House Democratic Caucus, which sent out Abrams’ press release, initially forwarded us a link to the Atlanta Regional Commission’s top 10 facts about the recent transportation referendum. The ARC, which works on growth and development issues for the 10-county metro area, said that Georgia was 48th in per capita spending on transportation. The ARC report did not have any charts or graphics showing how Georgia compares to other states. The caucus later sent us a report by the fiscally conservative Georgia Public Policy Foundation that said Georgia ranks 49th in per capita transportation spending. The report did not have a chart showing Georgia in comparison to the other states. We decided to do the math for ourselves as well. As part of our research, we noticed that several groups used data compiled by the Federal Highway Administration to calculate how much money each state spends on transportation. One chart we saw on its website had revenues used for highways. The most recent year was 2010. PolitiFact Georgia calculated the totals for each state and excluded federal funds since we are examining a claim about state spending on transportation. We then divided the total for each state by the number of its residents. Only two states had lower per capita highway spending, South Carolina and Tennessee. Georgia spent about $298 per person on highways. How did that compare to other reports on per capita highway spending that we reviewed? Georgia ranked similarly low. The Washington, D.C.-based Tax Policy Center found in 2009 that Georgia ranked ahead of just Rhode Island and South Carolina in per capita highway spending. The Tax Policy Center, a partnership between the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, examines federal and state tax policies and those of this year’s presidential candidates. Another report we found that examined transportation spending in Pennsylvania, based on data compiled in 2010, ranked Georgia 50th in per capita highway spending, using data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Federal Highway Administration. The report on Pennsylvania shows Georgia has more miles of highway than 40 states. Most of the states with more miles of highway also ranked low in per capita highway spending. The National Conference of State Legislatures ranked Georgia second to last in per capita revenue on highways in a report it released in 2006. The report examined highway spending from 1999 to 2004. Georgia spent about $220 per person annually, the report found. Only California was lower. Delaware was first, spending more than $900 per person, according to the research. The NCSL report also included data on spending for public transportation. Georgia ranked 38th of the 45 states that had data that could be examined. Georgia spent 55 cents per person in 2004, according to a chart in the report. Massachusetts was first, spending approximately $376 per person. Northeastern states dominated the top of the rankings and had more sources of transportation funding. We did not see any other reports on public transportation spending by state. The charts we reviewed and our own research all showed the same thing: Georgia was among the five lowest states in terms of per capita spending on highways. The most recent NCSL report on public transportation showed a similar conclusion. Therefore, we rate the statement by Abrams as True.

pomt-09690	"Barack Obama won't even use the term 'war on terrorism.'"	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/11/sean-hannity/hannity-says-obama-wont-even-use-term-war-terroris/	On Sean Hannity's Fox News show on Nov. 9, 2009, the topic was what the government knew about Fort Hood psychiatrist Nidal Malik Hasan, an Army major who authorities say killed 13 people and wounded 30 others. "There is a chance our government knew all about this guy Hasan and did nothing because nobody wanted to be called an Islamaphobe," Hannity said. "Now, this is a terrorist act," Hannity said. "What does that say about Barack Obama and our government?" "Here's the point," Hannity said, "Barack Obama won't even use the term 'war on terrorism,' because he's apologizing to America in every Muslim country he can." We've heard a number of conservative radio and talk show hosts criticize President Obama for not using the "global war on terrorism" phrase adopted by his predecessor, George W. Bush. And so we decided to check it out. We did a word search of Obama's public statements and could not find that Obama has used the phrase "war on terrorism" as president, though he said it numerous times as a candidate. And early in his presidency, Obama used the phrase "war on terror," but only a couple of times. So what gives? We found two instances where Obama directly addressed the question. The first was during a Jan. 27, 2009, interview by Hisham Melhem with al-Aribiya, an Arabic-language television news station. Melhem noted that Obama seemed to eschew Bush's phrase "war on terror" and "frame it in a different way, specifically against one group called al-Qaida and their collaborators." Obama: "I think that you're making a very important point. And that is that the language we use matters. And what we need to understand is, is that there are extremist organizations -- whether Muslim or any other faith in the past -- that will use faith as a justification for violence. We cannot paint with a broad brush a faith as a consequence of the violence that is done in that faith's name. "And so you will, I think, see our administration be very clear in distinguishing between organizations like al-Qaida -- that espouse violence, espouse terror and act on it -- and people who may disagree with my administration and certain actions, or may have a particular viewpoint in terms of how their countries should develop. We can have legitimate disagreements but still be respectful. I cannot respect terrorist organizations that would kill innocent civilians, and we will hunt them down. "But to the broader Muslim world what we are going to be offering is a hand of friendship." The issue was again raised in a Feb. 3, 2009, interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper: Cooper: "I've noticed you don't use the term 'war on terror.' I think I read an article that you've only used it once since inauguration. Is that conscious? Is there something about that term you find objectionable or not useful?" Obama: "Well, you know, I think it is very important for us to recognize that we have a battle or a war against some terrorist organizations. But that those organizations aren't representative of a broader Arab community, Muslim community. ... You know, words matter in this situation because one of the ways we're going to win this struggle is through the battle of hearts and minds." Cooper: "So that's not a term you're going to be using much in the future?" Obama: "You know, what I want to do is make sure that I'm constantly talking about al-Qaida and other affiliated organizations because we, I believe, can win over moderate Muslims to recognize that that kind of destruction and nihilism ultimately leads to a dead end, and that we should be working together to make sure that everybody has got a better life." So Obama isn't fond of the phrase "war on terror." But did that ever become blanket White House policy? According to a Washington Post story in March, a memo e-mailed to Pentagon staff members from the Defense Department's office of security review said "this administration prefers to avoid using the term 'Long War' or "Global War on Terror.' Please use 'Overseas Contingency Operation.' " According to the memo, the direction came from the White House Office of Management and Budget, which reviews speeches given by administration officials. Kenneth Baer, an OMB spokesman, told the Washington Post there was no such guidance, that it was only the opinion of "a career civil servant." Still, you don't hear administration officials using the term "war on terror," or the like, very often. Obama was criticized in some circles when he failed to even utter the words "terror" or "terrorism" in a June 4, 2009, speech in Cairo, Egypt, directed to Muslims around the world. The absence of those words "goes to the heart" of Obama's new approach, said John O. Brennan, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, who provided perhaps the clearest and most in-depth explanation of the White House lexicon in a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies on Aug. 6, 2009. "As many have noted, the president does not describe this as a 'war on terrorism.' ... Instead, as the president has made clear, we are at war with al-Qaida, which attacked us on 9/11 and killed 3,000 people. We are at war with its violent extremist allies who seek to carry on al-Qaida’s murderous agenda. These are the terrorists we will destroy. These are the extremists we will defeat." Brennan warned that it would be wrong for people to conclude that Obama is not committed to fighting terrorism. "President Obama has articulated a clear policy — to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qaida and its allies," Brennan said. "That is our mission, and the president described it in no uncertain terms in his inaugural when he said, 'Our nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred.' And to win this war against al-Qaida, the administration continues to be unrelenting, using every tool in our toolbox and every arrow in our quiver." Our aim here is not to wade into the war of words over the "war on terror." Rather, we just wanted to see if Hannity was right that Obama won't use the term "war on terrorism." And except in a couple of instances where he used the phrase "war on terror," Obama has generally employed different words. And it's deliberate, as he has explained on several occasions. Obama provides nuanced explanations for his word choices, and you may agree or disagree with them, but the bottom line is that Obama has chosen not to use the phrase "war on terrorism." And so we rate Hannity's statement True.	None	Sean Hannity	None	None	None	2009-11-11T19:19:37	2009-11-09	['None']
pomt-06620	"[Eighty-five percent] of the funds collected in each county will be redistributed elsewhere -- not spent in the county in which it is collected."	false	/georgia/statements/2011/sep/20/debbie-dooley/could-counties-be-out-luck-if-sales-tax-passes/	The road to next year’s referendum on a new sales tax to fund transportation projects in the Atlanta region is getting treacherous for the idea’s supporters. State lawmakers last month punted on a proposal to hold the referendum in November 2012, on the date of the presidential election -- when more Democrats are likely to be at the polls. Experts believe the referendum has more support among Democrats. Political observers called the decision to stick with holding the referendum on the July 2012 primary date a victory for tea party supporters, who said the idea of moving the referendum was tantamount to voter shopping. This month, one active tea party member raised another concern about the tax in an op-ed that was published in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Eighty-five percent "of the funds collected in each county will be redistributed elsewhere -- not spent in the county in which it is collected," Debbie Dooley wrote. "That means if DeKalb County raises hundreds of millions of dollars over a decade and wants to spend it on filling potholes, synchronizing lights or providing turn lanes, it is out of luck. It has to send the money to the region for redistribution on an already-determined project list." Hmmm. Isn’t the reason that leaders in some metro Atlanta counties want the tax is to pay for transportation projects in their communities? The current project list shows nearly $150 million in projects solely for DeKalb County, which Dooley mentioned in her op-ed. Norcross Mayor Bucky Johnson, chairman of the group of regional leaders tasked to come up with a list of projects, said Dooley’s statement doesn’t add up. "If a jurisdiction wasn’t getting their part, you would hear them crying by now," Johnson told us. Dooley cited state Transportation Department reports to back up her argument. "Only 15 percent is guaranteed to stay local," she said. "We don’t know what their [final] project list is going to be," Dooley said. "They’ve got a lot of wiggle room. They can change [the list]." Dooley correctly points out that 15 percent of the money collected in each county must go to that jurisdiction. The remaining 85 percent is put into a pot of money that will pay for various projects that are put on the list, which is supposed to be finalized on Oct. 15. The counties in the Atlanta region are Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, Gwinnett, Henry and Rockdale. If passed by voters, the 10-year, 1 percent sales tax is expected to raise about $6.1 billion for regional transportation projects. Julie Ralston, communcations director for the Atlanta Regional Commission, said each county will get a minimum return of at least 77 percent on what it collects from the tax for those projects in their jurisdiction. "Everyone is getting something beyond their 15 percent," Ralston said. "[Dooley’s statement] is absolutely false." Dooley’s concerns about the tax are twofold. She thinks all the funds collected in a county should be spent in its jurisdiction. Her other problem with the tax is she thinks it is a ruse to expand MARTA, the bus and rail system that currently operates in DeKalb and Fulton counties. "I think they’re using smoke and mirrors on this," she said. Fayette County Commissioner Steve Brown, like Dooley, has his concerns about the tax. For example, he doesn’t think the current list allocates enough money for some projects. Case in point, planned improvements at I-85/ Ga. 74 interchange, which is heavily used by Fayette County residents. There is currently $22.5 million set aside for the project. "To widen the on and off ramps will cost $22 million," he said. "That’s not going to begin to do that project." Brown said he understood Dooley’s concern about the tax, but he doesn’t fully agree with her statement. "Technically, you could have a county on the short end of the stick," he said. "I don’t know if that is going to happen." Johnson said there’s a very small likelihood that Dooley’s concerns are accurate. "I guess that’s a possibility. There could be some changes," he said. "But the point of what we looked at is geographic equity. It is spread out reasonably throughout the district." Johnson added, "Every county is getting at least 75 percent or 80 percent of what they’re putting in." Dooley believes it is the intention of local leaders to use a portion of the 85 percent of money from the tax, if approved, in each county. She is worried, however, that the list will be changed and leave a county without any of that 85 percent. Others closely involved in putting the list together say such a scenario is slim. Rockdale County has only three projects that are solely in its county on the current list. There’s not much concrete at this point to support Dooley’s claim. We rate it False.

pomt-15239	"The Mexican government ... they send the bad ones over."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/06/donald-trump/trump-mexican-government-they-send-bad-ones-over/	In the first Republican primary debate of the 2016 presidential race, billionaire developer Donald Trump -- the leader in recent polls -- made a splash. Early in the debate, Fox News’ Chris Wallace, one of the moderators, pressed Trump on some of his past statements about undocumented immigration -- the signature issue of Trump’s campaign. Wallace asked Trump, "What evidence do you have, specific evidence, that the Mexican government is sending criminals across the border?" Trump cited conversations with "border patrol people" who told him that it was true: "Our leaders are stupid, our politicians are stupid, and the Mexican government is much smarter, much sharper, much more cunning, and they send the bad ones over because they don't want to pay for them, they don't want to take care of them. Why should they, when the stupid leaders of the United States will do it for them?And that’s what’s happening, whether you like it or not." We checked a previous comment by Trump on this topic. In a July 8 interview with NBC, Trump told interviewer Katy Tur, "The Mexican government forces many bad people into our country because they're smart. They're smarter than our leaders, and their negotiators are far better than what we have, to a degree that you wouldn’t believe. They're forcing people into our country. … And they are drug dealers and they are criminals of all kinds. We are taking Mexico’s problems." Is the Mexican government sending people across the border, rather than individuals making decisions on their own to leave in search of seek employment or to join family members in the United States? When we talked to a range of immigration experts, we found wide agreement that that there is no evidence to support Trump’s claim. For evidence, we started with the Mexican Migration Project, a bi-national research effort founded in 1982 to study Mexican migration to the United States. Anthropologists, sociologists and other experts with the project gather data, including field interviews with migrants, that illuminate migration patterns. The co-director of the project is Douglas Massey, a professor of sociology and public policy at Princeton University. Based on more than three decades of field research, Massey found Trump’s assertion to be flat wrong. He pointed to findings from a paper he published in 2014 in the journal International Migration Review. In the paper, he and his co-authors concluded that undocumented migration from Mexico "was driven largely by U.S. labor demand and by the existence of well-developed migrant networks that provided migrants with access to U.S. labor markets despite a rising enforcement effort. The taking of additional trips is likewise tied to U.S. labor demand and access to migrant networks, as well as the number of U.S. trips a migrant has accumulated over his or her career." What about Mexican government efforts to push migrants into the United States? Nonexistent, Massey told PolitiFact. "Mexico has never had a policy of pushing migrants toward the United States, much less ‘forcing many bad people into our country,’ " Massey said. "Mexican migration is tied to social and economic circumstances on both sides of the border." Other experts sided with Massey. "Immigrants come to work or to join family," said Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer with the Pew Research Center’s Hispanic Trends Project. "And no, the Mexican government doesn’t force anyone to leave." "No, the Mexican government doesn't force anyone to move here illegally, though it certainly doesn't object," added Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors low levels of immigration. Tom Smith, a demographer at the University of Chicago, drew a contrast with one historical example in which a government did take a role in pushing certain people to emigrate to the United States -- the Mariel boatlift from Cuba in 1980. "While most immigrants were simply part of the general Cuban population of people wanting to emigrate, it appears that the Cuban government did intentionally send a disproportionate number of those they deemed to be undesirables, including prisoners and other institutionalized groups," Smith said. But there is no such evidence that the same thing has happened in Mexico, he added. About the closest support for Trump’s claim that we could find is the argument that the Mexican government’s failure to provide strong economic growth and restrain drug violence has been a factor in convincing people to leave the country and come to the United States. Still, it’s not accurate to equate the Mexican government’s inability to accomplish these goals and the idea that the government is pushing people out. It’s also worth noting that migration from Mexico to the United States has been declining in recent years. This is due to demographic factors more than anything else, Massey said. Trump "does not seem to have gotten the memo, but undocumented migration stopped in 2008 and has been zero or negative since -- not because the economic fundamentals have changed, but because the fertility rate dropped from 6.7 births per woman in 1970 to 2.2 births today, bringing about an aging of the population," Massey said. "People initiate migration between the ages of 18 and 30, and if they don't migrate then, they are unlikely ever to migrate." In other words, Massey said, the number of people in the age category most conducive to immigration is dropping, so immigration is dropping as well. Our ruling Trump said, "The Mexican government ... they send the bad ones over." Setting aside the question of whether Mexicans who have come to the United States are "bad" or not, we found no evidence of any Mexican policy that pushes people out of Mexico and into the United States. As has been the case for decades, a combination of economic and family factors accounts for most of the migration from Mexico to the United States. For the second time, we rate this claim Pants on Fire.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2015-08-06T22:12:35	2015-08-06	['Mexico']
pomt-09546	"We're also cutting a Forest Service economic development program that strayed so far from any mission that it funded a music festival."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/04/barack-obama/obama-proposed-axe-budget-forest-service-program-v/	In remarks after unveiling his proposed 2011 budget on Feb. 1, President Barack Obama spoke of the need to rein in spending by cutting "what doesn't work to pay for what does." Obama boasted that the administration has gone through every department's spending "line by line" looking for "inefficiency, duplication and programs that have outlived their usefulness." Last year, he said, the administration found $17 billion in cuts; and "this year, we've already found $20 billion." And then Obama threw out a few "commonsense" examples: "We cut $115 million from a program that pays states to clean up mines that have already been cleaned up," Obama said. "We're also cutting a Forest Service economic development program that strayed so far from any mission that it funded a music festival." We'll briefly touch on the first example later, but we want to focus on that second one, the proposal to eliminate the $5 million budget for a Forest Service economic development program "that strayed so far from any mission that it funded a music festival." Forest Service officials told us the Economic Action Program (EAP) was created in the 1990s to stimulate and assist natural resource-dependent rural communities and natural resource-based businesses to pursue self-sufficiency and sustainability. And what about the music festival Obama mentioned? It's true. The EAP awarded a $10,000 grant to the Pacific County (Washington) Economic Development Council -- which it leveraged with $57,075 of its own funds -- to "provide partial funding for operation of the 1997 Water Music Festival including hiring local and regional artists and musicians. The Festival will help to enhance tourism and provide cultural opportunities for the small communities in southern Pacific County." In case you missed it in the middle of the sentence, we reiterate: The music festival was in 1997! The first year of Bill Clinton's second presidential term. The year Comet Hale-Bopp made its closest approach to Earth and the English Patient won the Oscar for Best Picture. Asked about the festival, Becky Rine, a spokeswoman for the Forest Service, explained via e-mail that "in the late 1990s, the Forest Service awarded a number of small grants to the state of Washington to help small communities hurt by the economic downturn following decreased logging (associated with the spotted owl). Project selection was based on the ability to implement the project quickly and put people to work, as hundreds of logging mills were shut down in the Northwest." "The music festival funding was not earmarked," Rine stated. "The grant was part of a multiagency revitalization effort for the Pacific Northwest." The EAP has not funded a music festival since. Still, Forest Service spokesman Joe Walsh acknowledged, "For sure, that went beyond the scope of the forestry service. We concur that it does not serve the interests of the agency." But what does the EAP fund these days? Is it still funding projects that stray from the Forest Service mission? We asked the Forest Service press office several times for a list of last year's grant recipients. We finally got this e-mail response from Rine: "Since 2002, specific funding for projects has not been determined by the Forest Service, because they have been enacted by Congress." Can you say earmarks? In its formal budget proposal documents, the White House states that the EAP has provided funding for projects that have "marginal relation to the mission of the Forest Service or to forestry in general," though it doesn't provide a timeline. It lists several examples, including the music festival, and adds that "the program is also duplicative of other USDA programs that can address priority needs in rural areas and assist forest-based industries." It's almost the identical argument made by the Obama administration when it proposed that the program be cut last year. Congress funded it with $5 million anyway. In fact, it's also the same argument made by the Bush administration, when in 2008 it proposed to ax the EAP's funding. Congress awarded the program nearly $5 million that year, too. Clearly, this program has a patron (or patrons) in Congress who keeps shoving the money back in. But good luck finding out who that (or they) might be, said Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan Washington advocacy group that tracks government spending and highlights waste. The same scenario is true for the first example cited by Obama, the proposal to cut $115 million "from a program that pays states to clean up mines that have already been cleaned up." Obama proposed a similar cut last year, as did Bush the year before. In other words, Obama administration officials may have gone through the budget line-by-line to find waste, but these two examples were initially identified as wasteful or duplicative by the Bush administration. And when Obama says the administration found $17 billion in cuts last year, and $20 billion so far this year, we're not talking about $37 billion in total cuts. "A lot of the cuts are repeat customers from last year," Ellis said. Interestingly, Obama did not mention the biggest-ticket item on his list this year, the plan to cut nearly $3.5 billion from NASA's Constellation Systems Program, which aimed to resume manned missions to the moon. That proposed cut is not sitting well with some legislators in Florida, home of the Kennedy Space Center, and they have vowed to fight to have the funding restored. When it comes to the two examples cited earlier, we think it's misleading for Obama to say "we found" them. Both of the cuts were suggested by Bush in 2008. We also think Obama's remarks suggest the administration has identified $20 billion in cuts this year in addition to the $17 billion in cuts it found last year. In fact, many of the proposed cuts this year are repeats from last year that were ultimately overridden by Congress. The two examples cited by Obama here make for good belt-tightening sound bites. But this strikes us as part of the annual budget dance that happens every year: The administration proposes cuts it knows full well will be restored by some anonymous member of Congress who supports the program. And maybe the Forest Service's EAP program is "not targeted" or duplicative, as Obama's budget documents suggest, but it's misleading for Obama to employ a way-back machine to discredit a $5 million Forest Service program by citing a $10,000 grant awarded for a music festival in 1997, during the Clinton administration. And so we rule his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-10464	Barack Obama's health care plan "will cost taxpayers $1,700 more to cover each new person."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/21/hillary-clinton/hard-numbers-are-just-guess-timates/	Sen. Hillary Clinton has a new health care ad in Pennsylvania in which she accuses Sen. Barack Obama of attacking her, and then takes a few jabs at him. Obama's plan "will cost taxpayers $1,700 more to cover each new person," Clinton's ad states. "Obama's health care plan leaves 15-million people with no coverage." We've previously checked her statement that Obama's plan leaves 15-million people without coverage and found it to be Half True . For evidence that Obama's plan will cost $1,700 more, the Clinton campaign pointed to a blog post by Paul Krugman of the New York Times. Krugman believes Clinton's plan, with its universal mandate that requires every person to have health insurance, is superior to Obama's plan, which does not. Krugman's numbers come from a study by Jonathan Gruber, an economist with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Gruber's latest working paper is about covering the uninsured in the United States. Gruber studied broad models for providing health insurance, comparing a plan that includes a mandate with one that does not. Krugman and Clinton's ad both correctly note that the per-person cost difference between the two models is about $1,700 per year. But as Krugman notes, the models, while "broadly similar" to Clinton's and Obama's health plans, are not the same. For one thing, Obama's plan has a mandate for children, so it is not the same as a plan with no mandates at all. Also, experts we've interviewed previously about the Clinton and Obama health plans have emphasized the difficulty of putting hard numbers to the campaign proposals. The proposals are broad outlines and contain little in the way of hard numbers for subsidies or eligibility for subsidized insurance. This makes it hard to say exactly how much the plans will cost. ( We looked at this point previously when Obama said his plan would save more .) So Clinton's ad is pushing the envelope quite a bit to say that her plan would save $1,700 per person. Yes, there is evidence that a mandate lowers costs for everyone, but whether $1,700 would be the difference between her and Obama's plan is a different matter. We find her statement to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00187	Says Patrick Henry said, "The Constitution is not a document for the government to restrain the people: it is an instrument for the people to restrain the government."	false	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/oct/19/blog-posting/bloggers-spreading-false-patrick-henry-quote-limit/	Did Patrick Henry, the patriot best known for saying, "Give me liberty or give me death," assert that, "The Constitution is not a document for the government to restrain the people: it is an instrument for the people to restrain the government"? In a Facebook post, Sean O'Brien suggests that there are allegations that Henry never uttered those words, but he dismissed them. "There are people accusing me of this quote being fake. I can assure you, there is some evidence that Patrick Henry did say this, and if you want to call it fake, you’re really missing the actual message of it. Who said it isn’t as relevant as the message itself!!!" The Oct. 2, 2018, post has been shared more than 43,000 times. The sentiment has also been used by politicians such as Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Readers are free to embrace the message, but to say Henry or any other famous person said something he didn't is an example of fake news. In this case, the attribution is designed to give a statement extra gravitas by attributing it to a founding father. So whether Henry said it or not is important. When we asked O'Brien for evidence that Henry was the author, he quickly responded via Facebook Messenger that the only thing he could find was a reference at goodreads.com, which does not cite a source. "As to whether he actually said it, none of us were alive back in the 18th century to know for certain about this," he said. The meme, complete with flawed punctuation, says it was created by ConstitutingAmerica.org, which didn't respond to an email asking for its source. Evidence that the quote is a fabrication has been around for years. In 2012, Thomas S. Kidd, distinguished professor of history at Baylor University and author of "Patrick Henry: First Among Patriots" said it as one of several bogus Henry quotes on the Internet. The earliest reference he could find at the time was from a pair of books published in 2003. "Why create a bogus quotation when Henry actually said similar things about the need to restrain government?" Kidd wrote. Since the essay, Kidd said in an email, "I still have never seen any information that would suggest that this is a legitimate Henry quote." Jon Kukla, historian and author of the 2017 book "Patrick Henry: Champion of Liberty" and former director of Red Hill -- The Patrick Henry National Memorial in Charlotte County, Virginia, agreed via Facebook Messenger, "Regardless of sentiment — these words are NOT Patrick Henry's." The "phrasing strikes me as very 20th century," he wrote. "And I'm afraid there are several more bogus Henry quotes floating in cyberspace along with bogus quotes from other founders. I have never understood why advocates of any cause stoop to inventing quotations? Wouldn't you want to know that your cause is true? How can you do that if you're making up fake quotations. It's beyond me." We rate the claim as False.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2018-10-19T12:51:32	2018-10-02	['None']
pomt-01964	ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi was "released by Obama in 2009."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/19/jeanine-pirro/foxs-pirro-obama-set-isis-leader-free-2009/	The march of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, across a swath of Iraq has fractured a nation and spurred Republican attacks that the Obama administration is on the verge of "snatching defeat from the jaws of victory." Fox News host Jeanine Pirro tied President Barack Obama to the roots of the current assault. On June 14, Pirro offered listeners this insight into the ISIS leader. (ISIS is also called ISIL, for Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.) "The head of this band of savages is a man named Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, the new Osama Bin Laden," Pirro said. "A man released by Obama in 2009, who started ISIS a year later. And when Baghdadi left Camp Bucca, where the worst of the worst were held in Iraq, he threatened his American jailers saying, ‘I’ll see you in New York.’ " A reader wanted to know if Obama actually released Baghdadi, and we decided to look into it. Whatever the truth, the assertion has gained traction. For the president’s critics this fits with their disdain for the recent prisoner swap that freed Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl in exchange for five Taliban leaders who had been kept at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Red State, a conservative blog, used the Baghdadi connection to talk about Obama’s "catch-and-release" policy. We have two elements to verify. Was Baghdadi in U.S. custody in 2009 and did Obama have a direct connection to his release? We’ll deal with them in order. Will the real Abu Bakr al Baghdadi please stand up There have been several articles -- from Slate, and NBC among others -- that place Baghdadi at a detention facility in Iraq called Camp Bucca in 2009 (when Obama would have been president). However, all the talk tracks back to a Daily Beast interview with Army Col. Kenneth King, the former commander of Camp Bucca. That article said King knew Baghdadi at the camp and that he didn’t expect to see him become the leader of a spectacularly vicious and brutal movement. "I’m not surprised that it was someone who spent time in Bucca but I’m a little surprised it was him," King said. "He was a bad dude, but he wasn’t the worst of the worst." In this storyline, Baghdadi was handed over to Iraqi justice system late in 2009 shortly before Camp Bucca closed. However, when PunditFact asked the Defense Department to confirm the story, officials there said Baghdadi was released in 2004, not 2009. "Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim Al Badry, also known as ‘Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’ was held as a ‘civilian internee’ by U.S. Forces-Iraq from early February 2004 until early December 2004, when he was released," the Pentagon said in a statement. "He was held at Camp Bucca. A Combined Review and Release Board recommended ‘unconditional release’ of this detainee and he was released from U.S. custody shortly thereafter. We have no record of him being held at any other time." In short, according to the Defense Department, the man who heads ISIS was released in 2004, long before Obama took office, and was not recaptured. ABC News also has questioned King’s recollection, citing a "a U.S. official" that Baghdadi was not in American custody in 2009. "I could be mistaken," King told ABC News, "but I’m 99 percent. He’s a dead ringer for the guy I had the run-in with … His face is very familiar." King declined to comment to PunditFact. A troubled detention policy If Baghdadi wasn’t in American custody in 2009 as Defense Department officials say, then there’s no way Obama could be to blame. But even if he was, the link between the ISIS leader and the American president are flimsy because the framework was set in in 2008 while George W. Bush was president. A little backstory. By July 2005, the United States had four detention facilities -- two near Baghdad, one in the northeastern corner of the country, and Camp Bucca in the far southeastern corner near the Kuwait border. The entire operation was known as Task Force 134. In the course of the war, some 80,000 people passed through these centers, according to the Defense Department. A Pentagon-commissioned study by RAND, a private policy analysis group, described a system that struggled with competing expectations. The incoming population was a mix of captured Sunni and Shiite militants, people rounded up in military raids and ordinary criminals. At times, a blend of overcrowding and sectarian animosities led to riots. The RAND study also said the 2007 "surge" -- the addition of 20,000 new troops into Iraq to quell spreading unrest -- pushed detainee levels to over 25,000 people. From 2007-08, Navy Captain Brian J. Bill served as the legal adviser to Detainee Operations for the Multi-National Force in Iraq. Bill described the process of vetting inmates in the U.S. Naval War College journal, International Law Studies. The military established nine review boards, working six days a week, to hear 20 cases each day. Bill reported that when the boards first began they released about 25 percent of the individuals who came before them. Later, that rose to 40 percent. The end of the detention policy At the end Bush’s second term in 2008, American and Iraqi negotiators moved toward getting the United States out of the business of holding large numbers of Iraqis. Robert Chesney, professor of international security law at the University of Texas School of Law, said neither side wanted to see the network of detention centers continue. "Its demise reflected a deliberate policy choice by the United States and Iraq to phase out that system and to rely instead on the Iraqi criminal justice system as the sole mechanism for detention going forward," Chesney wrote in 2011. That goal became part of the U.S.-Iraq Status of Forces Agreement, signed in November 2008. Under that agreement the United States agreed to "turn over custody of such wanted detainees to Iraqi authorities pursuant to a valid Iraqi arrest warrant and shall release all the remaining detainees in a safe and orderly manner." The United States continued to hold about 200 prisoners judged to pose the greatest risk. They were what remained from a group that numbered about 14,000 at the start of 2009. "Aside from the so-called ‘Deck of Cards’ detainees held at Camp Cropper (the top leaders in Saddam Hussein’s government), it’s hard to imagine how anyone in Washington would have any interest in who we held or released," Bill told PunditFact. "By the end of 2009, it’s hard to imagine how we could have continued to hold anyone if the Iraqis themselves didn’t decide to detain them." Our ruling Pirro said that Obama released the current head of ISIS from government custody in 2009. The Defense Department said that the man now known as Baghdadi was released in 2004. The evidence that Baghdadi was still in custody in 2009 appears to be the recollection of an Army colonel who said Baghdadi’s "face is very familiar." Even if the colonel is right, Baghdadi was not set free; he was handed over to the Iraqis who released him some time later. But more important, the legal contract between the United States and Iraq that guaranteed that the United States would give up custody of virtually every detainee was signed during the Bush administration. It would have required an extraordinary effort to have held on to Baghdadi and there is no evidence that he was on anyone’s radar screen, assuming that he was in custody at all in 2009. The U.S.-Iraq agreement drove the release of thousands of detainees in 2009, but Obama had nothing to do with that. We rate the claim False.

pomt-06205	"Ohio’s Planned Parenthood operations received millions of taxpayer dollars via federal grants in 2010 and 2011."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/dec/09/ohio-right-life/ohio-right-life-says-millions-federal-aid-went-sta/	Ohio and several other states across the country this year have passed laws to restrict abortion rights, including legislation to defund Planned Parenthood, a nonprofit organization that provides health care services, including abortions. Ohio lawmakers, who already have passed a late-term abortion ban and other anti-abortion measures this year, have just begun hearings on Senate Bill 201, which is designed to defund Planned Parenthood and other family planning centers. The day before the first Senate hearing on SB 201, Ohio Right to Life, an anti-abortion group, promoted the proposed law as a key component of its agenda. "Ohio’s Planned Parenthood operations received millions of taxpayer dollars via federal grants in 2010 and 2011," a Dec. 5 news release from Ohio Right to Life said. Ohio Right to Life went on to say that Planned Parenthood has performed more abortions annually as its federal funding has increased. It lauds the bill as one that will direct funding away from abortion providers and calls the hearings on the bill a step toward making 2012 a "groundbreaking year for Ohio's pro-life movement." PolitiFact Ohio decided to examine Ohio Right to Life’s claim about public funding of Planned Parenthood, in light of its underlying contention that the funding of the agency supports abortion. We asked Michael Gonidakis, executive director for Ohio Right to Life, for specifics on the taxpayer money Planned Parenthood has received. Gonidakis said state agencies disbursed the federal grants, authorizing more than $1.6 million in 2010 to Planned Parenthood locations in Ohio and more than $1.7 million this year. He also provided a memo the nonpartisan Ohio Legislative Service Commission prepared detailing state agencies’ disbursement of federal grants to Planned Parenthood branches in Ohio. LSC compiled the information for Rep. Kristina Roegner, a Republican from Hudson who is a primary sponsor on companion legislation introduced in the House to defund Planned Parenthood. Roegner’s office confirmed the memo’s authenticity. Tara Broderick, president and chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood of Northeast Ohio, said the organization does receive federal grant money. But none of that money pays for abortions, she said. "A huge myth," Broderick said. "Absolutely I can say taxpayer money is not used for abortion services," she said. Planned Parenthood must sign an agreement affirming it will not use taxpayer money to provide, promote or refer abortion services, said a spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Health, which distributes the bulk of federal grant money that Planned Parenthood receives. Additionally, an audit is performed to account for the organization’s use of government dollars, Broderick said. According to Planned Parenthood, the vast majority of its clients receive health care services such as Pap tests, birth control and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases. Less than 4 percent of Ohio Planned Parenthood clients received an abortion, the organization stated. Nationally, Planned Parenthood performed 332,278 abortion procedures in 2009, the most recent year data was available. Those procedures made up 3 percent of the organization’s services, according to a Planned Parenthood fact sheet that was last updated in October. Gonidakis, of Ohio Right to Life, acknowledged that the federal Hyde Amendment and state law prohibits tax dollars for paying for abortions. "However, the significant public dollars Planned Parenthood does receive keeps them afloat and pays for pretty much their entire operations," he said in an e-mail. Not true, said Broderick, of Planned Parenthood of Northeast Ohio. She said the federal dollars make up 16 percent of the branch’s budget. So where does that leave us? Ohio Right to Life is correct to say that Planned Parenthood locations in Ohio have received millions in federal grants. But the connection between Planned Parenthood’s federal funding and its abortion services is not as direct as Ohio Right to Life’s news release implies. Federal law bars Planned Parenthood from using taxpayer money for abortions, and the agency must certify to the state that it does not do so. The money that would be redirected by S.B. 201 is used to provide other health services. Ohio Right to Life’s claim about funding for Planned Parenthood is accurate. That the money cannot be used for abortions and that abortion procedures make up a small percentage of Planned Parenthood services are additional pieces of information that provide the full picture. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Ohio Right to Life	None	None	None	2011-12-09T06:00:00	2011-12-05	['Ohio', 'Planned_Parenthood']
pomt-02003	Jason Carter supports using Georgia tax dollars to promote Obamacare	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2014/jun/11/republican-governors-association/gop-misfires-carter-claim/	Death and taxes have nothing on the inevitability of attack ads during election season. And since we live in Georgia – where an Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll in May found that 86 percent of voters see a candidate’s stance on the Affordable Care Act as a very important factor in their vote – it was another certainty that the federal health care overhaul also known as Obamacare would get prime billing. Enter "Bad Idea," a Republican Governors Association ad against Jason Carter, the Democratic state senator locked in a tight race against Gov. Nathan Deal. It opens with claims that health care premiums will increase under the law before asking why Carter would say expanding the Medicaid program to more low-income Georgians "should be on the table." Then, the hammer: "And why would Jason Carter support using Georgia tax dollars to promote Obamacare?" it asks. Carter’s staff disagrees with that assessment, saying his vote on an anti-Obamacare bill was about information, not taxpayer money. And that’s exactly the sort of conflict that sets the PolitiFact Truth-O-Meter aquiver. Jon Thompson, the RGA’s press secretary, pointed us to House Bill 943, which bars state or local government employees from advocating for the Affordable Care Act and prevents creation of a state-run health insurance exchange. It also prohibits the use of state or local money to hire people to help Georgians sign up for coverage under the law. Carter was among 17 senators who voted against the measure, 16 of them Democrats. "This law says we will not use our resources to implement a federal policy that our state disagrees with," said state Rep. Edward Lindsey, R-Atlanta. Lindsey wrote the amendment that watered down a previous bill, House Bill 707, that aimed to bar any state or local government agency from using money or resources to implement, not just promote, Obamacare. "Essentially, it is a statement from Georgia," Lindsey added. William Custer, the director of the Center for Health Services Research at Georgia State University, notes that Obamacare remains the law of the land, though. Even in Georgia. Even with House Bill 943. To that end, the bill as passed mostly prohibits what Georgia already didn’t plan to do – Deal had previously said he would not set up a state-run health exchange – and limits speech by public employees on taxpayers’ time, Custer said. "It’s certainly reasonable that a person could vote no on that because of First Amendment concerns or objection to the state telling local government what to do," he said. "As such, it was a message law. " Carter read the restrictions in the bill as banning Georgia from accepting federal dollars, not using state dollars, to help explain the overhaul to constituents, said his spokesman, Bryan Thomas. "Whatever anyone’s opinion on Obamacare, it’s a huge change to federal health care law," Thomas said. "(Carter) voted no because this bill prevented state and local government agencies from helping people understand that massive change." Carter did not issue a public statement to that end on the day of the vote, Day 39 of the 40-day session. In fact, he has remained mostly noncommittal about his thoughts on Obamacare in general as well as specific pieces of the law. That leaves his few statements open for interpretation – and political attack. This week, Carter told the AJC that expanding Medicaid would be one way to secure federal money to help keep rural hospitals open in the state. But Thomas, when asked whether Carter supports Medicaid expansion, said the candidate would also look at whether Georgia could get the same deal that Arkansas secured, to take new Medicaid money from the federal government to help the uninsured poor buy insurance on the private market. Thomas called it "a false choice" to answer yes or no if Carter would support Medicaid expansion as governor. "It’s not a yes or no question," Thomas said. That kind of non-answer answer does Carter no favors. Mischaracterizing his stance isn’t hard to do when he won’t give clear answers to the policy questions on voters’ minds. In summary, though, it is still a stretch to conclude that Carter’s objection to one anti-Obamacare bill translates into support for spending state taxpayer money on the law. PolitiFact could not find any specific tax increase that Carter supported as a state senator, shoring up his office’s claims that it would be out of the norm for him to vote in favor of a measure if he believed it would increase taxes. But because Carter’s stance has been so fuzzy, it opens the door for interpretation about what he really believes. We rate the GOP claim as Mostly False.

pomt-15116	Atlanta has issued an increasing number of citations - and collected an increasing amount of revenue - since Mayor Kasim Reed took office in 2010.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/sep/11/reader-email/are-citations-and-revenue-atlanta/	Anyone who has landed in a speed trap in some never-before-mentioned small town on I-75 in South Georgia understands the most basic example of policing for profit. A 2014 analysis by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution of five years of traffic fines paid in every police jurisdiction in the state – more than 500 in all – exposed numerous departments raking in exorbitant fine amounts. Atlanta collected below the metro region average of $116 per capita in fines, but still netted $50.6 million, or $112.98 for every person in the city. A scathing U.S. Department of Justice Department report found a more troubling kind of policing for profit in Ferguson, Mo., saying the city’s court system worked in tandem with police to charge escalating fines for minor offenses such as traffic violations in order to raise revenue. A reader reached out via email, arguing Atlanta actually mirrored the troubled Missouri city under Mayor Kasim Reed, when looking at all citations, not just traffic tickets, all in the name of generating income. Had Atlanta issued an increasing number of citations – and collected more money – since Reed took office? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check. Reed spokeswoman Anne Torres said traffic citations play an important role in overall public safety. There are more citations now, she said, because Reed has put more cops on the street in a bid to make Atlanta safer. "With hundreds of additional officers on patrol, and special tactical units assigned to traffic enforcement, the number of citations issued today versus 2009 will be significantly different, " Torres said in an emailed statement. By the numbers The reader email claimed that the number of tickets and citations issued in Atlanta had grown 20 percent during Reed’s tenure, from 337,697 in 2010 to 404,652 in 2014. Those numbers, he said, came from the Atlanta Police’s website, which includes data downloads, and a record request for the number of citations issued annually by PARK-atlanta, the name of the city’s outsourced parking enforcement. City leaders agreed in 2009 to a seven-year contract with Milwaukee-based Duncan Solutions to take charge of ticketing illegally parked vehicles and to install hundreds of parking meters across the city. Duncan agreed to pay the city $5.5 million a year under the PARK-atlanta program and keeps any additional money collected. That deal was problematic within days of beginning, with residents, business owners and patrons complaining that PARK-atlanta was too aggressive in its enforcement. Our reader attached a 2011 quote from Reed that he contends shows the reason for the complaints: a push for new revenue. "I think that if we do it well that that is an area to generate approximately $10 million dollars or more in revenue. We are going to have robust traffic enforcement and the court needs to be prepared to handle those cases because that is how revenue is being lost," the quote read. "We could ethically and appropriately, carrying out an essential government function, have a significant spike in revenue while protecting people," the quote continued. "Revenue is being lost." We were able to confirm the quote, part of Reed’s response to whether the increased enforcement would pay for the judges necessary to oversee the court, not pad the city budget. More problematic was coming up with the actual numbers of citations issued in Atlanta every year. The reader provided us with data from PARK-atlanta showing the number of annual citations. City officials confirmed the numbers are: 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 141,156 220,185 221,119 200,078 196,895 That’s a 40 percent increase in citations in five years. But remember, the city collects a set amount - $5.5 million a year – to hand over the enforcement to PARK-atlanta.So there is no reason for the city or Reed to encourage more citations. It’s a different story at the Atlanta Municipal Court, which handles the citations issued by Atlanta Police. The number cases handled each year are: 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 260,982 288,820 309,529 261,704 269,257 The city court collected $19.33 million from all fines and other sources, including fines and fees such as those associated with controversial private probation in 2010. By 2014, that number had grown to $27.94 million – a 45 percent increase in money that goes to the city’s general fund to pay for police, courts and other basic government needs. Torres said some increase would be expected, in part because Reed kept a campaign promise to grow the city’s police department. The department is constantly in flux but ended 2010 with 1,770 officers and ended 2014 with 1,936 (after briefly reaching Reed’s long-sought goal of 2,000 officers in 2013). Even accounting for attrition, that’s a 9 percent increase in the number of police on patrol in Atlanta. And that growth came on the heels of furloughs that reduced manpower in the police department by as much as 10 percent in 2009 because of the city’s financial woes during the economic downturn. In the meantime, Reed canceled red light cameras, and that revenue, in 2014 and has said he isn’t opposed to ending the deal with PARK-atlanta when it expires. That helps show the jump in tickets, and revenue, stems from the increased focus on public safety and is hardly a driver of the city’s budget, Torres added. Citations accounted for 3.5 percent of the city’s $552 million general operating fund in 2010 and about 5 percent of the $565 million operating fund last year. "It’s not a money maker to just issue tickets," Torres said. "The reason the city has a surplus today is because of pension reform, not revenue from traffic tickets. " Beyond Atlanta That brings us back to places like Ferguson. Atlanta doesn’t set policing policies in a vacuum. And given all of the problems cited in the Justice Department report, the city’s attitude about tickets is "remarkable," said Karin Martin, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. "I think you can’t really divine motivation," Martin said. "The language being used about increasing revenue is problem enough. Atlanta has its own socio-economic and racial divides, so who is subjected to this police force and is the proportion reflected by the population?" In other words, is Atlanta over-policing specific segments of the community with its citations? We didn’t get demographic details on citations, so that much is unknown. Given the city’s population grows by about half every workday, many of the citations are expected to be against people who live outside Atlanta but travel into it for jobs or special events. While research would support that an increase in police officers would increase citations, Martin said those studies generally focus on foot patrols and so-called community policing that assign officers to the narrow areas to build visibility and trust. If visitors turn out to be the bulk of those cited, it effectively makes the tickets a tourist tax, not the result of renewed enforcement in unsafe areas, Martin said. "If people are afraid of having their purse snatched or to walk alone because of crime, you would have a reason to approach traffic enforcement as increased policing," she said. "But that doesn’t appear to be the explicit need here, which raises the speculation about motive." Our ruling A reader reached out to PolitiFact Georgia, claiming Atlanta has issued an increasing number of misdemeanor citations since Mayor Kasim Reed took office in 2010. The reason was money, the reader argued. We couldn’t confirm the numbers the reader had calculated. But our research showed that tickets issued since Reed took office have increased, both when issued by city police and the city’s outsourced parking enforcer. Combined, the number of citations increased about 16 percent in that time – and the revenue collected from them swelled a whopping 45 percent. City leaders have a point that some growth would be expected, given the private parking enforcement and the increase in officers in the city. Proving the motivation – increased revenue, more focused policing or a combination of both – is difficult, if not impossible, to pinpoint. But even with the caveats, the statistics back up the claim about ticket and revenue growth. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Reader	None	None	None	2015-09-11T00:00:00	2015-09-03	['Kasim_Reed']
pomt-14470	"There have been multiple media reports about (Donald Trump's) business dealings with the mob, with the mafia."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/02/ted-cruz/yes-donald-trump-has-been-linked-mob/	Donald Trump "seems terrified to release his taxes" because they may reveal his true net worth, his donations to liberal causes, or something even seedier, Sen. Ted Cruz suggested on Meet the Press. "There have been multiple media reports about Donald's business dealings with the mob, with the mafia," Cruz said Feb. 28. "Maybe his taxes show those business dealings are a lot more extensive than has been reported." Pressed by host Chuck Todd to back up his claim, Cruz cited reports by ABC and CNN. A Cruz spokesman forwarded us several other media reports detailing the real estate developer’s alleged ties to organized crime. The Trump campaign did not get back to us. Is Cruz right that the Donald has worked with a few Dons in his career? HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRA FACT-CHECKER It’s important to note that Trump hasn’t been charged with any illegal activity, and it’s reasonable to argue that he was unaware or even a victim in some cases. But Cruz has a point that the mogul has been linked to the mob for decades. Mob control a ‘fact of life’ Before we detail Trump’s alleged ties, none of this proves that Trump was happy doing business with the mafia or even in cahoots with them at all. La Cosa Nostra had a virtual monopoly on concrete in New York at the time Trump was adding his name to its skyline in the 1980s. And the mafia’s control over building supplies and labor unions meant that the crime families had a hand in most construction projects in Manhattan. Trump and other major developers "had to adapt to that situation" or build elsewhere, said James B. Jacobs, a mafia expert who was part of a state task force on organized crime. "That was the fact of life, that was the way it was," he told PolitiFact. "The contractors and developers weren’t pure victims. You could bribe the mob-controlled union leaders and get relief from the more arduous conflicts. But we had no information that Trump was any different." That being said, Trump’s business dealings with the mob or mob-related characters are widely documented. Let’s run through them. Mafia concrete for Trump Plaza Trump was first tied to the mafia in the 1980s, when a $7.8 million subcontract for Trump Plaza was awarded to S&A Concrete, according to Fortune. The company, as Cruz correctly says, was partially owned by Anthony "Fat Tony" Salerno, the boss of the Genovese crime family. Trump himself acknowledged as much in a December 2015 interview with the Wall Street Journal, admitting that S&A Concrete was "supposedly associated with the mob." "Virtually every building that was built was built with these companies," he said, adding, "These guys were excellent contractors. They were phenomenal. They could do three floors a week in concrete. Nobody else in the world could do three floors a week. I mean they were unbelievable. Trump Tower, other buildings." When Salerno was indicted in 1986, the charges specifically mentioned Trump Plaza. Salerno’s 1992 obituary ends with a nod to the luxury highrise and 15 other Manhattan buildings. Trump World Tower, supported by the Quadrozzi Concrete Company, is also tangentially related to La Cosa Nostra. The head of the company, John Quadrozzi Sr., was tied to the Lucchese crime family and indicted for making illegal payoffs to the mob in 1992. TIME and Daily Beast have speculated that Trump Tower was also built with mafia influence, though the evidence is less concrete. Atlantic City partnerships Trump’s alleged mob dealings were not confined to New York. According to reports from the Huffington Post and Philadelphia Inquirer, Trump made a deal in Atlantic City with Kenneth Shapiro, an associate of mob boss Nicky Scarfo, and mob-connected labor boss Daniel Sullivan. Trump seemed aware of this, calling Shapiro "a third-rate, local real estate mafia" and Sullivan "the guy who killed Jimmy Hoffa." Nonetheless, in 1981, Trump leased a portion of the land for Trump Plaza and Casino from a company the two men controlled, according a report by New Jersey gaming regulators. The company refused to cooperate with the authorities, and Trump eventually ended the partnership and bought out their shares. Later Trump brought on Sullivan as a labor negotiator at the Grand Hyatt Hotel and introduced the man to his own banker, according to the Los Angeles Times. Through intermediaries Trump bought the property for the casino from the "crown prince" of the Philadelphia mob, Salvatore Testa, for $1.1 million in 1982. Multiple media reports and an unauthorized biography about Trump allege this was more than twice its market value. (Testa purchased the property in 1977 for $195,000.) According to The Federalist, two construction companies controlled by Nicky Scarfo ended up building Trump Plaza and Casino. "You had contractors that were supposedly mob-oriented all over Atlantic City," Trump said when the Wall Street Journal asked him about it, adding that "every single casino company used the same companies, just I hope you will say that." A few years later, Trump’s organized crime connections extended overseas. In 1992, a Senate subcommittee named Danny Leung, who was then the vice president for foreign marketing at Trump Taj Mahal, as an associate of the Hong Kong-based organized crime group 14K Triad. "Leung has also given complimentary tickets for hotel rooms and Asian shows to numerous members and associates of Asian organized crime," reads the report, which also identified three other triad-connected business associates or former employees of Trump’s gambling empire. According to gaming regulators, Leung "flew in 16 Italian organized crime figures from Canada who stole more than $1 million from the casino in a credit scam," reported the New York Daily News in 1995. "The incident was never reported because Trump never filed charges." Leung, who had a separate contract to bring gamblers from Toronto to the casino, denied the affiliation to organized crime, and his casino and junket licenses were renewed. (The Trump Taj Mahal declared bankruptcy in 1991, and his other Atlantic City properties folded a decade later.) Mob-linked business adviser And there’s Felix Sater, "a twice-convicted Russian émigré who served prison time and had documented mafia connections" and the subject of the ABC story Cruz referenced. Sater pleaded guilty to a charge of money laundering in 1998 and was indicted again in 2000 for taking part in a $40 million stock scheme involving four Mafia families, according to the New York Times report. From 2003 to 2007, Sater traveled the country promoting projects for Trump, and his company was a partner in the Trump SoHo hotel. Trump told the Times he "never knew that." Three years later, Sater returned to the Trump Organization and had business cards that described him as Trump’s "senior advisor," the AP reported. Trump told the AP that he’s "not familiar" with Sater. Our ruling Cruz said, "There have been multiple media reports about Donald's business dealings with the mob, with the mafia." While it’s important to note that these connections were not atypical in the real estate and casino businesses in the 1980s, Cruz’s statement is accurate. Media reports have linked Trump to mafia bosses and mob-connected business associates for decades. We rate the claim True.

pomt-09808	"It’s a plan that incorporates ideas from many of the people in this room tonight – Democrats and Republicans."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/09/barack-obama/Obama-says-health-plan-incorporates-ideas-of-Democ/	In his address on health care to a joint session of Congress on Sept. 9, 2009, President Barack Obama suggested the health care bills in Congress are a bipartisan collaboration. "It’s a plan that incorporates ideas from many of the people in this room tonight — Democrats and Republicans," Obama said. Earlier in the day, in a conference call with the media, Obama's deputy communications director, Dan Pfeiffer, argued that while the health bills in the House and Senate have not gotten Republican votes, the process was bipartisan because dozens of Republican amendments were adopted. And that's technically true. But it's a stretch to characterize it as bipartisan. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions adopted 159 amendments offered by Republicans, but only two of them were significant or controversial enough to merit roll call votes. One of those two affected the manufacture of biologics medication and another required members of Congress and congressional staff to enroll in the government-run option. Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, said 132 of the 159 were for "technical amendments" and that it was a misnomer to call them proof of bipartisanship. None of the Republicans' priorities have gotten any traction, he said: Tort reform, equalizing the tax code, reducing the proposed cuts to Medicare spending, and scrapping the proposed "public option." In fact, he said, only one big-picture Republican issue seems to have gotten the attention of the Democratic majority: creating incentives for wellness, such as cutting insurance costs for people who exercise or don't smoke. Over in the House, several versions of health care bills have passed various committees. Here's how Republican amendments fared there: In the Energy and Commerce Committee, 16 Republican amendments were adopted. With the exception of one that would create a pathway for nonpioneer drug companies to manufacture "follow-on" biologics, said Lisa Miller, a spokeswoman for Republicans on the committee, none of the Republican amendments could be considered major, and none change the core of the legislation. "The process in our committee was bipartisan only in that we were given the opportunity to mark up the bill," said Miller. "In large measure, the bipartisanship that existed during the E&C markup was that of luck and circumstance, not intent among Democrats." In the Education and Labor Committee, just six of the 17 amendments offered by Republicans were adopted. Several "probably are best described as technical," said Alexa Marrero, a spokesman for Republicans on the committee. And one, which sought to have members of Congress be enrolled in any government-run plan that would be created, was defeated by Democrats in other committees. One, from Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., would allow employers who would have to cut jobs to meet health coverage costs the opportunity to seek a waiver from the bill’s requirements. It was adopted by voice vote. In the House Ways and Means committee markup, all 38 of the Republican-sponsored amendments were rejected along a party-line vote. To see a more detailed accounting of some of the Republican amendments that have been considered, click on some of the links in our list of sources. But suffice to say, we didn't come across many that passed that seem significant. Michael Steel, spokesman for House Republican Leader John Boehner, said that while it's true that some Republican or bipartisan amendments were accepted, the legislation itself has received zero Republican votes. "No amendments have changed the core of the legislation" or altered the public option, Steel said. Back when the House Education and Labor Committee considered its version of the bill in mid July, several Republican legislators complained that there was little real effort to engage a bipartisan process, and they called on Democrats to scrap the plan and start over. According to an article in Congressional Quarterly , the panel’s chairman, George Miller, D-Calif., said that Republicans and Democrats simply have a "serious difference in opinion on how to approach health care in this country." We also note that after Obama's appeal to the joint session of Congress, the man designated to offer Republican rebuttal, U.S. Rep. Charles Boustany, R-La., again called on Obama and Congress to "start over on a common-sense, bipartisan plan focused on lowering the cost of health care while improving quality." When Obama said the health plan incorporated ideas from Democrats and Republicans, we think he grossly overstated the bipartisanship of the process to date. Both sides claim the other party is to blame for that, an issue that we will not wade into here. However, we note that none of the plans that have graduated from congressional committees have received a single Republican vote. Yes, Congress adopted dozens of the amendments proposed by Republicans, but we couldn't find any that dramatically altered the plan. Still, to the extent there were at least some, we give Obama's statement a Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00319	Says Tennessee Senate candidate Phil Bredesen "supports single-payer health care."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/sep/20/senate-leadership-fund/gop-super-pac-wrongly-says-democrat-bredesen-suppo/	In Tennessee’s U.S. Senate race, Democrat Phil Bredesen presents himself as a centrist candidate who just wants to fix problems. The Senate Leadership Fund aimed to change that image with an ad that casts him as a radical leftist when it comes to health care. The Republican super PAC, built by allies of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is spending $1.2 million on a television ad that opens with the bold headline: "Bredesen supports single-payer health care." "Phil Bredesen is on record supporting single-payer health care," a woman’s voice says. "He even wrote a book pushing socialized medicine." The ad pops the cover of Bredesen’s 2010 book Fresh Medicine. Bredesen made a small fortune as a health care executive. He was an early critic of Obamacare but now says he does not want to repeal the law. Single-payer health care didn’t seem quite like his style, so we cracked open his book and took a look at the ad’s claims. Key takeaways In 2010, Bredesen had a plan that would give every American a voucher that they could use to buy basic health coverage –– not from a traditional insurance company but from newly created "systems of care." The money for the vouchers would come from a payroll tax of about 20 percent. Providers would redeem the voucher money from the government, but the government would not be paying claims as it does under Medicaid and Medicare. Bredesen today says he opposes single-payer health care. Super PAC makes its case The Senate Leadership Fund draws heavily from Bredesen’s 2010 interview on C-SPAN about Fresh Medicine. "Single-payer, the federal government collecting the money and then turning it over, I mean that’s what I think actually we should do," Bredesen said Oct. 20, 2010. "Single-payer in the sense of Medicare, where government is collecting the money and then is paying all the claims, I think would be a disastrous direction for the country." In that one answer, Bredesen used the term single-payer two different ways, and had totally opposite takes on each. In another of the super PAC’s examples, Bredesen redefined Medicare for All, a popular shorthand for single-payer care. "What I was proposing was really a two-piece thing," Bredesen told Governing magazine in 2010. "It's Medicare for All, but give people a voucher and limit the amount of it. I don't think you can solve it by leaving it as an open-ended entitlement." Bredesen’s proposal went way beyond vouchers, but the idea of vouchers for Medicare, often called premium-support, is something most Democrats have pilloried, and some Republicans, such as House Speaker Paul Ryan, have supported. Not your grandfather’s Medicare for All There is a bill in Congress by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., to create a Medicare for All program. It would provide soup-to-nuts care for everything that is "medically necessary." From family doctors, to prescription drugs, to long-term care, Medicare for All would cover it. Importantly, every American of any age would be eligible and the government would pay doctors, hospitals and every other type of provider. That means no vouchers. As the advocacy group Physicians for a National Health Program put it, "single-payer national health insurance, also known as ‘Medicare for All,’ is a system in which a single public or quasi-public agency organizes health care financing, but the delivery of care remains largely in private hands." Bredesen’s proposal would cover every American, and government would play a huge role in defining what is and isn’t covered. But after that, his approach takes a different path. In his 2010 book, Bredesen envisioned a country filled with large multi-faceted provider networks he calls "systems of care." "What I mean specifically by this phrase is a formal organization that receives a determined payment for each of its patients, takes responsibility for the delivery, quality, coordination and payment for health care for for those who belong to it, and which competes with other systems of care in its geographic area for the business of citizens," Bredesen wrote. So the government would determine how much a standard basket of care would cost, give everyone a voucher for that amount and let them pick the network they liked best. The network would know that the voucher is all it would get for each person. If people wanted more, they could buy it from their own pocket. Employer-sponsored health insurance would be gone, and in large measure, so would insurance companies. The money for the vouchers would come from payroll taxes, which would be high, but less than the premiums people pay today, Bredesen argued. This table summarizes some of the key similarities and differences between Medicare for All and Bredesen’s plan: Everyone covered Basic package of care Voucher Government pays providers Medicare for All Yes Yes No Yes Bredesen Yes Yes Yes No "Single-payer implies that there is one entity such as the federal government that collects funds and pays for health care," said RAND health economist Christine Eibner. "The voucher system described –– which involves multiple competing payers –– wouldn’t fit into that category." Health policy professor Paul Ginsburg at the University of Southern California also said that today’s single-payer label wouldn’t apply. Ginsburg does see some key similarities between Bredesen’s idea and today’s Medicare Advantage program. With Medicare Advantage, a person over 65 picks a private plan and pays premiums, with some additional payments coming from Washington. "Large delivery systems are partnering with insurers to offer Medicare Advantage plans with networks built around the system," Ginsburg said. Eibner told us that while Bredesen’s approach doesn’t fit with the popular understanding of single-payer plans, the term is not precisely defined. Bredesen today vs. 2010 Bredesen’s vision for a future health care system built on organizations that don’t yet exist comes from a book he wrote eight years ago. Where he stands today is less clear. At a June 20, 2018, campaign event in Tennessee, he said he was "not for single-payer, particularly." His campaign website gives no details of his plan, although it does offer a link to Fresh Medicine. We asked his campaign if he had a policy paper on health care and heard that he does not. Our ruling The Senate Leadership Fund said Bredesen supports a single-payer plan. Bredesen used those words in a 2010 book interview, but in the same breath, he said a single-payer plan would be disastrous. Health policy researchers find telling differences between Bredesen’s ideas and single-payer plans as they are proposed today. Most important, Bredesen proposed a voucher system and the government would not pay provider claims. By that yardstick, they said his proposal does not fit the single-payer category. Plus, Bredesen said recently that he is not for a single-payer plan. The ad obscures some very important details and misleads voters on Bredesen’s stance. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-01783	"We have a 40 to 50 percent dropout rate in our inner-city schools."	false	/texas/statements/2014/jul/27/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-incorrectly-says-texas-has-40-percent-/	Houston state Sen. Dan Patrick, the Republican lieutenant governor nominee, vowed to reach out to all Texans in his general-election campaign. Addressing his party’s June 2014 state convention, Patrick continued: "I’m going to go into Democratic strongholds and I’m going to tell them about school choice and educational opportunities, because we have a 40 to 50 percent dropout rate in our inner-city schools, and that cannot stand, for those families and for our state." We wondered about those proclaimed dropout rates. The numbers from Patrick, who chairs the Senate Education Committee, contrast sharply with those cited by the the Texas Education Agency, which reported a statewide high school dropout rate for the class of 2012 of 6.3 percent. (Austin’s high schools averaged a 3.7 percent dropout rate, topping out at LBJ High School’s 8.4 percent rate, according to the agency.) The state said nearly 88 percent of more than 316,000 seniors graduated in 2012, with another 5 percent staying in high school and 1 percent receiving GED certificates. Patrick’s back-up information Asked how Patrick reached his percentages, Patrick’s campaign manager, Logan Spence, said by email Patrick looked at graduation rates for selected high schools in the Houston, Dallas and Fort Worth school districts. Spence listed 11 high schools in those districts that he described as having graduation rates ranging from nearly 60 percent down to 47 percent, implying dropout rates of more than 40 percent to 53 percent. Spence said Patrick’s numbers were based on raw data for the class of 2012 posted on TEA web pages for each school. Spence also suggested we contact Caroline Neary of the Houston-based Children at Risk Institute; she told us the group was the source of the graduation rates that Patrick used. Neary said the institute, which describes itself as a non-partisan research and advocacy organization dedicated to addressing the root causes of poor public policies affecting children, works from state data to calculate school graduation rates in part by choosing not to believe some of the reasons schools use to account for students leaving before graduation. Like the TEA, Children at Risk acknowledges students who have died or left for home-schooling and doesn’t count any of them as dropouts. The institute’s president, Bob Sanborn, told us it also credits a school with a graduate even if a student transfers to another Texas public school sometime before graduating. But unlike the state, the institute doesn’t assume students recorded by schools as leaving for private school or moving to a school in another state or country actually did so, instead considering such students all to be dropouts, Sanborn confirmed. Summing up: By Patrick’s approach, the dropout rates for his subset of 11 inner-city schools ranged from nearly 41 percent to 53 percent. By the accepted state and federal gauge, the rates ranged from 5 percent to 27 percent. We took a close look at Patrick’s dropout methodology. Snapshot: Lee High School, Houston To take one school as an example, we spoke with Houston school spokeswoman Sheleah Reed about the graduation rate result indicated by Patrick for students at the district’s Lee High. The school’s TEA profile page says the 2008-09 school year started with 608 "brand new ninth graders. If you had visited our school in May 2012, you would want to see 608 students wearing caps and gowns, right?" But students moved in and out of the school over the years, the profile says, leaving a net 531 students who "you would expect" to be 2012 graduates. Still, only 272 students received diplomas, the profile says. At a glance, this suggests a graduation rate of 51 percent, though not acknowledging students leaving or coming to the school over the four years yields a 45 percent graduation rate, a result based on dividing the 272 graduates by the 608 students in ninth grade four years earlier. This is close to the 47 percent graduation rate for Lee High presented by Patrick’s camp. Then again, drawing on the "leaver" codes employed by high schools, the state profile for Lee accounts for nearly all the students who didn’t graduate, stating that fewer than five students earned GEDs while 35 students remained at the school longer. Others were marked as returning to home countries (69 students); enrolling out of state (55) or in private school (41); or shifting to home schooling (less than 20). Also, 40 students dropped out or couldn’t be tracked, according to the profile. Asked for comment, a spokeswoman for the Houston school district, Sheleah Reed, suggested it’s an error not to adjust for students who have left and entered a school over four years or not to consider the students enrolled for another year. By email, Reed noted that by the metric accepted by the state (the longitudinal definition we covered above), Lee High had an 80 percent graduation rate. We confirmed that figure from a state chart posted online, which further indicated Lee’s class of 2012 had a 9.4 percent dropout rate. Source: Texas Education Agency, search of website starting here, July 2, 2014. Other analysts For outside expertise, we reached out to Grover J. "Russ" Whitehurst, a Brookings Institution senior fellow and former U.S. Department of Education official. Whitehurst, testifying in December 2012 on behalf of the state in a lawsuit over its school funding system, expressed concern that high schools could game the dropout reporting system. He said what commonly happens is a student drops out but is instead listed as having moved or transferred when his classmates and even school administrators know the truth. Still, Whitehurst, by email to us, called Patrick’s calculations idiosyncratic, hence generating the problems noted by the Houston district. Also, at our request, Lori Taylor, an associate professor in Texas A&M’s Bush School of Government and Public Service, explored how Patrick reached his graduation/dropout rate result for Lee High. Taylor, a member of the Children at Risk Institute’s Public Policy Advisory Board, then replied that any calculation getting to the graduation rates cited by Patrick for Lee and three other high schools he singled out as "bogus," she said by email, for ignoring certain students each school recorded as having left for other reasons. Taylor went on to say she didn’t see a way Patrick’s figures could be accurate. Responses from Patrick, institute We shared Taylor’s analysis with Neary and Spence, who emailed: "Dan doesn't use the state definition of ‘dropout’ because it doesn't accurately reflect the significant number of students who are leaving our schools before graduating." Neary said by email she could understand Taylor’s reasoning, adding: "Of course we know that every student who moves from public school to private school (or another state, or their home country) isn’t actually a dropout, even though our model does assume this. Since there is no way to independently verify leaver codes," meaning how the schools account for each student who leaves, "it is all or nothing in using them. We choose to use this more conservative estimate as a counterpoint to the state’s rates. We don’t claim to have a perfect calculation for exact graduation rates, but we are transparent in our method." Sanborn said by phone the institute's calculations are "the closest to the truth you’re going to get." Our ruling Patrick said: "We have a 40 to 50 percent dropout rate in our inner-city schools." Asked to back up his statement, Patrick failed to account for all the state’s inner-city high schools and the handful of schools he singled out had official 2012 dropout rates of 5 percent to 27 percent, far short of 40 percent or more. His proclaimed figures depend on assuming schools hide dropouts by misrepresenting them as leaving for private school or for schooling outside Texas. We rate this claim as False.

pomt-15337	Says President Obama "is reducing our naval fleet to 1917 levels..."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2015/jul/13/ew-jackson/ew-jackson-says-obama-cutting-naval-fleet-1917-lev/	E.W. Jackson, a minister who was the Virginia GOP’s nominee for lieutenant governor in 2013, says President Barack Obama is trying to sink the Navy. "(Obama) is reducing our naval fleet to 1917 levels, while China establishes naval hegemony over the Pacific," Jackson wrote in an Independence Day email announcing the formation of a veterans group seeking better treatment of active and former service members. We wondered whether Obama really is cutting the fleet to a level not seen since the U.S. entered World War I. Jackson backed his claim by sending us a 2012 PolitiFact National article detailing a downward trend in the fleet’s size and a 2014 op-ed in The Hill by two former Navy officers. Jackson is hardly the first politician to criticize the nation’s military readiness by comparing today’s fleet size with that of about 100 years ago. He joins company that includes Mitt Romney, the GOP presidential nominee in 2012; Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a current presidential candidate; and Leon Panetta, Obama’s secretary of defense from 2011-2013. The comparisons usually start in the final years before the United States’ 1917 entry into World War I. In 1915, the U.S. had 231 active ships, according to Navy figures. That rose to 245 ships by December 1916. The fleet rapidly grew in 1917, the year Jackson cited. That April 6, the date the United States formally entered the war, the Navy had 342 active ships. The Navy offers no other figure for 1917. Last year, the Navy had 289 active ships, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service. That’s four more ships than Obama inherited when he became president in 2009. So available statistics show it would be impossible for Obama to reduce the Navy to 1917 levels because the fleet, in raw numbers, was already below that level when Obama took office. We also examined Jackson’s statement using the December 1916 data, when the Navy had 245 active ships. Is Obama taking the Navy down to that level? There’s two ways to read the numbers. For several years, the White House has embraced a long-term plan that would elevate the Navy to 300 active ships in 2019 and keep it at or above that level through 2045. But any hope of achieving that depends on repealing sequestration -- a bipartisan agreement between Congress and Obama to slice debt by $1 trillion over nine years, with half of the savings coming from defense and half from domestic programs. The automatic cuts began in early 2013 after Democrats and Republicans failed to agree on any other way to pare debt. Adm. Jon Greenert said two years ago that sequestration, if not repealed, could force the Navy to trim its fleet to 255 or 260 active ships by 2020. That would be the lowest number since the end of 1916. Greenert, the chief of Naval operations, said during Senate testimony earlier this year that the Navy would do its best to shield ship building and restoration from sequestration by trying to find savings from other parts of its budget. He said the 255-ship figure was no longer valid, but didn’t provide an updated figure. There’s a final matter to consider in Jackson’s claim. Even if the number of ships is cut to a pre-World War I quantity, would that mean, as Jackson wrote, that Navy fleet has been reduced to almost a 100-year low point in readiness and capability? Many military analysts answer with a resounding no, saying those who utter such claims confuse quantity with quality. "Now, our fleet has nuclear-powered supercarriers and nuclear-powered attack submarines," said Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. "The capabilities of the ships we have today, you can’t even compare that to the ships we had in 1917." Alex Roland, a military history professor at Duke University, offered a similar take to PolitiFact National last year during a fact check on comments made by Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. "One of the reasons for the decrease in size -- both Army and Navy -- is that we now rely far more on technology than on sheer numbers," Roland said. "The question is not how we compare to our army in 1940 or our Navy in 1915, but how we compare with our potential enemies in 2014. We are head and shoulders above them." The bottom line, analysts have told PolitiFact time and again over the years, is that historic military numbers are not a good gauge of present-day strength. Our ruling Jackson says Obama "is reducing our naval fleet to 1917 levels." Even if we give Jackson a break and start his comparison at the end of 1916 -- prior to the U.S. entry into World War I -- his statement has significant problems. No doubt, our military is facing cuts from sequestration and, if the automatic reductions for defense and domestic programs continue, the Navy has said its number of active ships could fall to pre-World War I levels. But this has not been a solo act by the president. Sequestration is the consequence of a bipartisan deal between Congress and the White House who, otherwise, haven’t agreed on a plan to reduce debt. And counting the historic size of the fleet, analysts tell us, is a flawed way to assess Naval might. What chance would you give the dreadnoughts of the early 20th century against today’s nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and submarines? We rate Jackson’s statement Mostly False.	None	E.W.

pomt-04114	The fiscal cliff deal "ultimately raised taxes."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/jan/11/tom-price/fiscal-cliff-impact-taxes-matter-perspective/	Even before the smoke cleared from the new year’s fiscal cliff battle, politicos were at it again. They couldn’t agree whether the deal hiked taxes or cut them. Erstwhile allies contradicted each other. Tax nemesis Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, tweeted that it was a tax cut. Members of Congress who signed his group’s pledge to never raise taxes kept their promises, he said. U.S. Rep. Tom Price, a Roswell Republican and a fiscal hawk, came away with the opposite impression. "My assessment was that it ultimately raised taxes and didn’t decrease any spending. In fact, it increased spending," Price said during a Jan. 2 interview on WMAL-FM, a Washington-area radio station. So which one is it? A tax increase or a tax cut? We waded chin-deep into the swampy depths of federal budget making to find out. We’ll tackle whether the deal is a spending cut or an increase in a separate story. A spokesman for Price said that the congressman was referring to a variety of provisions that change taxes for individuals and businesses, such as the switch in marginal tax rates for those who make more than $400,00 a year and alterations to estate and investment tax rules. But this is only part of the story. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office issues independent analyses of legislation to help lawmakers gauge its impact on the federal government’s coffers. It found that the fiscal cliff deal, otherwise known as the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, will actually cut the money the federal government raises through taxes by $3.6 trillion through 2022. This means that by its reckoning, the deal is a tax cut. How can taxes rise and fall at the same time? It’s a matter of perspective, experts told us. The fiscal cliff was a legislative package of painful tax increases and spending cuts set to begin if Congress failed to take action on the budget by midnight Jan. 1. The lawmakers who designed it thought the measures would be so draconian that Congress would have to act before then. It wasn’t, and the country fell off the cliff. But something about staring into the fiscal abyss stirred the House of Representatives into action. A deal passed hours into the new year. If it had failed to act, the old law would have placed projected tax revenue at $44 trillion through 2022, according to the CBO. But under the new deal, revenue would equal $40.4 trillion -- hence the $3.6 trillion tax cut But there’s another way of assessing whether new tax legislation is a cut or increase: comparing the revenue to the taxes we used to pay in 2012. From this perspective, they’re up. In August, the CBO released tax revenue projections based on an "alternative fiscal scenario" where taxes through 2022 would stay much the same as they were in 2012. Its analysts found that receipts would have totaled $38.9 trillion. Under terms of the last-minute deal, they’re some $1.4 trillion higher. Both of these perspectives, or "baselines," have their strengths and weaknesses. Budget analysts use the first method because it keeps them from having to guess what future law will be. But the latter comparison can give more perspective on the law’s impact on consumer spending. "When politicians talk about this, either analysis is legitimate," said Howard Gleckman, an Urban Institute expert. The trick is to make sure you don’t mix up your baselines. If you’re comparing current taxes with the ones we paid in 2012, use it for spending as well to avoid an apples-to-oranges comparison. (Price runs into trouble on this front. We’ll address this in a future PolitiFact.) This brings us to the unsatisfying conclusion that Price is right and wrong. The fiscal cliff deal raises taxes compared with prior policy, but it lowered them compared with prior law. Or, in other words, if Congress kept the 2012 law, our taxes would be higher than they are now. But if our taxes stayed at 2012 levels, they’d be lower. This means Price’s statement that the fiscal cliff deal "ultimately raised taxes" is Half True. It is accurate but leaves out important details.

pomt-10147	"As mayor, every year I was in office I did reduce taxes."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/03/sarah-palin/property-taxes-rates-went-down-sales-tax-up/	In the vice presidential debate on Oct. 2, 2008, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin reached back to her tenure as mayor of a small Alaska town to make a point that she has some history as a tax cutter. "I’m going to talk straight to the American people and let them know my track record also," Palin said. "As mayor, every year I was in office I did reduce taxes. I eliminated personal property taxes and eliminated small business inventory taxes and as governor we suspended our state fuel tax. We did all of those things knowing that that is how our economy would be heated up." We’re going to focus here on the claims Palin makes about her record as mayor of Wasilla, Alaska, from 1996 to 2002. During that time, Wasilla’s property tax rate did inch down year after year, from 2 mills to 0.5 mills. But did taxes actually go down? That depends on how you define taxes. The overall amount of taxes collected increased by 25 percent under Palin. According to a review of Wasilla's financial reports, the amount of revenue taken in during 1996 was $6,070,806 and rose to $8,710,166 in 2002. That’s a 43 percent increase (25 percent when adjusted for inflation). So how is it possible to lower the property tax rate but take in more in taxes? The simple answer is sales tax. The sales tax is overwhelmingly the chief source of revenue in Wasilla. In 2002, the sales tax brought in nearly $6-million, compared to $343,000 from property taxes. And according to a city analysis, the amount of money brought in by the sales tax increased each year, by a total of about 50 percent between 1997 and 2002. That's a testament to economic growth in Wasilla, said current Mayor Diane M. Keller. In fact, under Keller, property taxes were later eliminated. The increased sales tax revenues allowed Palin to cut the property tax rate each year at the same time spending increased. The operating budget for Wasilla went from $6,050,160 in fiscal year 1996 to $9,393,768 in 2002, according to figures provided by the city. That’s a 55 percent increase (35 percent when adjusted for inflation). While the property tax rate decreased on Palin's watch, the sales tax rate increased from 2 percent to 2.5 percent. The increase was approved by voter referendum to pay for construction of a multiuse sports complex. Due to the economic growth in the community, Keller said, Wasilla is going to be able to stop charging that extra 0.5 percent sales tax two years earlier than anticipated. Under Palin’s mayorship, the city also took on an additional $23.7-million in long-term debt to finance the sports complex as well as for street and water projects. According to Keller, much of the additional spending under Palin was due to the growth of the city during those six years, both economically and in increased population. Palin is right when she says personal property tax and business inventory taxes were eliminated. But those cuts were mostly offset by an increase in a vehicle tax enacted by Matanuska-Susitna Borough — the equivalent of a county in many states — where Wasilla is located. A portion of the vehicle tax is distributed to Wasilla. According to a Dec. 24, 1997, article in the Anchorage Daily News , the elimination of Wasilla's personal property tax and business inventory taxes amounted to a revenue loss of about $93,000 a year. The borough's vehicle tax increase brought Wasilla an additional $70,000 a year. Palin can rightly claim that the property tax rate decreased when she was mayor. But she fails to note that while property tax rates went down, sales tax revenues went up. Some may not consider that a tax increase. But in addition to more revenue from increased economic activity, the sales tax rate also was increased. That increase was tied to funding a new sports complex, and was passed by referendum, but it’s still an additional tax. And so we find Palin's statement Half True.

pomt-09408	"Americans who get their insurance through the workplace, cost savings could be as much as $3,000 less per employee than if we do nothing."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/19/barack-obama/obama-says-health-reform-legislation-could-reduce-/	As the health care reform legislation heads toward a final vote, President Barack Obama has been out stumping hard for the plan, promising that if it passes, insurance premiums for most people will go down, at least compared to where they would be if the bill doesn't pass. "Americans who get their insurance through the workplace, cost savings could be as much as $3,000 less per employer than if we do nothing," Obama said in a health reform speech at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., on March 19, 2010. "Now, think about that. That’s $3,000 your employer doesn’t have to pay, which means maybe she can afford to give you a raise." We couldn't help but notice that this statistic is at odds with the forecast from the government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that Obama has been so fond of citing in the health care debate. But the CBO is not where the president got his number. Rather, the White House told us he got this statistic from a November report commissioned by the Business Roundtable, an association of CEOs from some of the country's leading companies. The report, prepared by Hewitt Associates, a global human resources outsourcing and consulting company, states, "We estimate that if enacted properly, the right legislative reforms could potentially reduce that trend line by more than $3,000 per employee, to $25,435." As a baseline for its analysis, Hewitt assumed that if the government does nothing, health care costs will continue to rise at the same pace they have over the last decade -- just over 10 percent a year. By that measure, health care expenses for companies would rise 166 percent by 2019, a rate they conclude is "not sustainable." The report is not a line-by-line analysis of the bill now being considered by the House, but rather looks at reforms in a broader context, said MacKenzie Lucas, a spokeswoman for Hewitt. Nevertheless, the report did consider the legislation in play at the time, most of which remains in the bill now being considered, and concluded it "provides opportunities for real savings." Among the promising ideas included in the legislation, the report stated, are "proposed delivery system reforms such as value-based purchasing, Innovation Centers to experiment with alternative methods of provider reimbursement, accountable care organizations, payment bundling, and financial penalties for avoidable hospital readmissions." The report estimates these and other reforms "could potentially reduce the rate of future health care cost increases by 15% to 20% when fully phased in by 2019." The report includes this caution, however: "This assumes the government implements the initiatives quickly, accurately, and consistently, and that private payers follow by implementing similar measures in a disciplined and timely way." So that's the Hewitt report. But what about the report from the oft-cited Congressional Budget Office? In November, the CBO estimated that for the four out of five Americans who would get their insurance through their employer, the effect on premiums would be modest. Specifically, the CBO found that for people in the small group market, employers with 50 or fewer workers, the change in premiums would range from an increase of 1 percent to a decrease of 2 percent in 2016. In the large group market, premiums are projected to be zero to 3 percent lower in 2016 (relative to current law). That shakes out to a reduction of about $100 a year, at best, for single policies. So how do we get from the CBO's projected reduction of maybe $100 to Hewitt's $3,000? While Hewitt tried to quantify the long-term effects of some of the cost-saving pilot projects being tried in the health reform bill, and assumed their potential if they were fully implemented industry-wide, the CBO shied away from forecasting the effect of such programs. The CBO report states: "The analysis does not incorporate potential effects of the proposal on the level or growth rate of spending for health care ... from the development and dissemination of less costly ways to deliver care that would be encouraged by the proposal. The impact of such 'spillover' effects on health care spending and health insurance premiums is difficult to quantify precisely, but the effect on premiums in 2016 would probably be small." But that doesn't mean those provisions should be dismissed, said Len Nichols, director of the Center for Health Policy Research an Ethics and George Mason University. While the CBO lacked the necessary proof to forecast the effects of programs that have never happened before, the potential savings from reorganizing the health care system are significant, he said. Assuming those changes occur, the $3,000 figure cited by Obama is a "pretty reasonable projection," Nichols said. Just don't expect those changes to affect your premiums any time soon. Some of them may be 10 to 20 years down the road, he said. "But if it's going to take 17 years, we need to start this afternoon," Nichols said. "Either we realign the incentives, or we suffer the fate." A couple qualifiers are in order here. First, none of the forecasts suggests premiums will be going down. Rather, the Hewitt report talks about premiums going up dramatically over the next decade, just not as much as if proper reforms are instituted. And the report is talking about long-term effects. The CBO doesn't think people getting insurance through an employer will see much change in premiums either way by 2016. And while the Hewitt report suggests significant reductions in health care costs could be achieved through meaningful health care reform, it doesn't say specifically that that is the case with the plan now before the House. And it provides lots of warnings about how things could go awry. In short, Obama is citing a very speculative report that doesn't speak directly to the legislation at hand. And it's a report that speaks to potential effects many years in the future. For more near-term effects, we think the CBO report is more definitive. But the Hewitt report does track a number of the provisions that were in the Senate plan in November, most of which are in the plan now before the House. We rate Obama's claim Half True.

pomt-04108	Says "how much money the government is collecting from people...in terms of the gross domestic product" is "the lowest in 40, 50 years."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/jan/13/bill-pascrell/rep-bill-pascrell-says-federal-revenues-share-econ/	The day before voting in favor of raising taxes on higher-income Americans as part of a deal averting the so-called "fiscal cliff," one North Jersey congressman argued that the amount of dollars reaching federal coffers has reached a historic low. As the nation braced for a series of automatic spending cuts and tax increases, Rep. Bill Pascell (D-9th Dist.) claimed in a Dec. 31 radio interview that, as a share of the economy, federal revenues are at their lowest level in up to a half century. "How much money the government is collecting from people...in terms of the gross domestic product" is "the lowest in 40, 50 years," Pascrell said on WOR-AM. It’s actually been even longer than Pascrell claimed. As a share of the gross domestic product, or GDP, federal revenues in recent years have been at their lowest level in roughly 60 years, according to data from U.S. Department of the Treasury and the White House’s Office of Management and Budget. In fiscal year 2012, which ended in September, federal revenues were 15.7 percent of GDP, slightly higher than the 15.4 percent in fiscal year 2011 and the 15.1 percent in both fiscal years 2009 and 2010. The last time when federal revenues were lower than those amounts occurred in fiscal year 1950, when revenues were 14.4 percent of GDP. Between fiscal years 1951 and 2008, the ratio of federal revenues to GDP ranged from 16.1 percent to 20.6 percent. Alan Auerbach, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told us the lower ratio in recent years is due, in part, to the fact that incomes and thus tax collections dropped during the recession. Another contributing factor is the tax cuts provided over the last decade, including the lower income tax rates first approved by President George W. Bush, according to Auerbach. "Taxes as a share of GDP tend to be ‘procyclical,’ meaning that the tax/GDP ratio rises during expansions and falls during recessions," Auerbach said in an e-mail. "That’s due to the progressivity of the income tax (increases in income are taxed at higher rates) and the volatility of corporate profits." "In addition to the Bush tax cuts, which also reduced revenues, we had measures adopted during the recession, notably the payroll tax cut that just expired," Auerbach added. In response to our findings, Pascrell spokesman Thomas Pietrykoski said in an e-mail: "What is clear as day is that the Bush Tax cuts took a hatchet to government revenue, significantly contributing to our current debt problems. Congressman Pascrell is supportive of a balanced approach in resolving the current fiscal situation that both cuts spending and asks the wealthiest among us to pay their fair share to reduce our deficit." Our ruling In a radio interview, Pascrell said "how much money the government is collecting from people...in terms of the gross domestic product" is "the lowest in 40, 50 years." The congressman’s point is solid, but his timing is slightly off. As a share of the economy, federal revenues in recent years have been at their lowest level in roughly 60 years. Starting in fiscal year 2009, revenues have remained below 16 percent of GDP, the lowest point since they hit 14.4 percent in fiscal year 1950. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-10461	Obama "supports hate-crimes expansion ... potentially putting churches at risk if they preach the truth about homosexuality."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/23/focus-family-action/the-first-amendment-is-still-in-effect/	A letter from the conservative group Focus on the Family Action makes a multifaceted attack on Sen. Barack Obama in an attempt to portray him as someone who would be "the most left-wing president in our nation's history." The article, written for the organization's Web site and widely circulated via chain e-mail, tries to paint Obama as bad for families, accusing him of everything from trying to further "the homosexual agenda" to being soft on the war against terrorists. Focus on the Family Action is the lobbying arm of Focus on the Family, an organization founded by evangelical Christian Dr. James Dobson. One of the claims in the article, written by Tom Minnery, senior vice president of Focus on the Family Action, states: "He (Obama) has pledged to homosexual leaders that he will sign the Employment Non-Discrimination Act ... (forcing businesses to defend themselves against discrimination lawsuits should they not hire a particular candidate who then announces he or she is homosexual or transsexual). He also supports hate-crimes expansion ... (potentially putting churches at risk if they preach the truth about homosexuality)." First off, Obama has, in fact, strongly supported the Employment Non-Discrimination Act and hate crime expansion. It's the bits that Minnery puts in parentheses that are misleading. We'll take these one at a time. The Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2007 would make it unlawful for employers to discriminate against an individual on the basis of actual or perceived sexual orientation. The law would provide employment protections to gay, lesbian and bisexual employees similar to those in the Civil Rights Act. The bill passed the House and has come to the Senate. Obama not only supports that measure, but would support expanding it to include gender identity as well, according to his campaign Web site. Focus on the Family has long been opposed to the legislation. Minnery told PolitiFact it could lead to this scenario: "Someone applies for a job and they are turned down, and later they identify themselves as a homosexual and claim that is why they weren't hired. How is an employer supposed to defend themselves against that charge? Proving a negative is nearly impossible." Particularly vulnerable are businesses that have religious people working for them, he said. Suppose, he said, that the person doing the hiring has a Bible on his or her desk and the applicant is put off by that, and claims later that the person had an agenda against homosexuals. If the new law is passed, he said, that applicant would be able to file a claim against the company. "That's a possibility here," Minnery said. Hardly, said Arthur Leonard, a professor of law at New York Law School and an expert in gay rights and discrimination based on sexual orientation. "They have to have known or thought the person was gay for there to be a discrimination claim," Leonard said. Brian Moulton, associate counsel for Human Rights Campaign, a strong proponent of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, said Minnery's hypothetical scenario is a red herring. "The burden of proof under ENDA is on the employee who has made a claim of discrimination," Moulton said. Twenty states already have these kinds of discrimination laws, he said, and there has been no run of unsubstantiated lawsuits. "If this were a real concern, we would have long ago seen this present itself," Moulton said. "The importance of the bill is that people who are losing their jobs because of their sexual orientation have no recourse. That's the real problem." Minnery's expressed concern about the expansion of hate-crime laws as "potentially putting churches at risk if they preach the truth about homosexuality" is similarly off base. An amendment co-sponsored by Obama sought to expand federal hate crime laws to include sexual orientation and gender identity. According to Minnery, that could lead to this scenario: Someone hears a sermon about the Bible teachings on homosexuality and then goes out and commits a crime against an innocent person; they claim they got the impetus from the church pulpit; and then the church gets charged with a hate crime. "It would have a chilling effect on teaching that part of the Bible that deals with homosexuality," Minnery said. Leonard, the law professor, said: "That's ridiculous." The First Amendment would protect the church against any kind of action like that, Leonard said. "No sane prosecuting attorney in the United States would go after a church due to a preacher making a sermon based on the Biblical teachings about homosexuality," Leonard said. Moulton, of Human Rights Campaign, noted that 32 states have hate crime laws that cover sexual orientation and, he said, "you aren't seeing members of the clergy being prosecuted under that state law for preaching about homosexuality." The hate crime legislation specifically notes that it will not impact anyone's First Amendment rights, including freedom of speech and religion. Is there such an instance where a church or pastor could be at risk under the law? "If you say, 'Gay people are evil and should be killed and here's a gun,' then yes," Moulton said. "But someone simply expressing what their religious tradition says about homosexuality from the pulpit, no." Although the Senate passed the expanded hate crimes legislation backed by Obama in September 2007, negotiators in the House and Senate did not include it as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, and it stalled. It's fair enough to take issue with Obama on his support of the two measures — certainly they were highly controversial and hotly debated. But Minnery's characterizations of what the bills would mean are misleading. We rule his statement False.	None	Focus on the Family Action	None	None	None	2008-04-23T00:00:00	2008-03-26	['None']
pomt-08563	"It takes as much energy to make a solar panel as it likely generates in its entire life."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2010/sep/28/jd-alexander/solar-panels-make-far-more-energy-they-require/	The Florida solar rebate debate begs for a little sunshine. The state owes Floridians $52.7 million in unpaid solar energy rebates. But lawmakers recently ignored Gov. Charlie Crist’s request to tap federal stimulus money to dent the backlog. Senate budget chief J.D. Alexander, R-Lake Wales, told a St. Petersburg Times reporter, "It takes as much energy to make a solar panel as it likely generates in its entire life. I really doubt that this is a good investment for the people of Florida." His energy payback claim caught some eyes — and ours. Steve Plice quickly e-mailed PolitiFact Florida. To the president of Tampa Bay Living Green, a nonprofit that teaches about environmental sustainability, Alexander’s claim stuck out. "Could you please check this?" he asked. "I have seen estimates for the energy payback period ranging from 18 months to 11 years. Solar panels are expected to last 20-30 years, so Mr. Alexander's claims would seem to be very wrong." As Plice suggests, this isn’t unexplored territory. For years, energy payback studies have examined how much energy it takes to manufacture, install and operate various kinds of solar panels, also referred to as photovoltaic modules or arrays. The idea is, a solar panel should capture more energy over its lifetime than it saps. Otherwise, as Alexander notes, one would hardly be a "good investment." We asked Alexander for support for his comments. He sent a link to a solar energy payback study he thought we "may find helpful." And did we ever. The study published by Energy Bulletin, an online clearinghouse of news and analysis, did, indeed, address Alexander’s claim. It mentioned the most commonly cited — and "possibly the only" — study that says the energy payback time on a solar panel may exceed its lifetime. The Energy Bulletin authors hadn’t found any published studies that reference the work, a 1996 book by Howard Odum called Environmental Accounting. They did note the popularity of Odum’s analysis on Web forums. Then they explain why Odum’s findings can be rejected. The Energy Bulletin authors, who reviewed other published work to reach wider conclusions about roof-mounted solar panel systems — a type a Florida homeowner might install — concluded the systems would generate enough electricity to cover their energy debt in two to eight years, and turn sunlight into energy for at least 25 years. So, they wrote in 2006, the systems "have a positive energy payback and are capable of contributing to a sustainable energy future." Alexander’s own link debunks his claim. But we were ready to examine other evidence, just in case. In 1975, the Florida Legislature created the Florida Solar Energy Center to research, test and certify solar systems and develop education programs. Dr. James Fenton, a professor of mechanical, materials and aerospace engineering, directs the institute at the University of Central Florida. Fenton pointed us to a study published two years later than Alexander’s that focuses on emissions from the life cycle of photovoltaic cells, and makes references to multiple energy payback studies. It explains that the life cycle of a photovoltaic system starts with mining quartz sand or metal ore, depending on the type of system, which then has to be purified and turned into silicon wafers or thin film. That takes a lot of energy, right? Sure, but only as much as is generated by solar systems in three to six years, and sometimes as little as a year or so, especially in sunnier climates, the study summarizes. The U.S. Department of Energy also weighs in on the topic, through a PV FAQs explainer piece called "What is the energy payback for PV?" produced by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. No good news for Alexander’s claim here. Instead, the FAQ says, "Based on models and real data, the idea that PV (photovoltaics) cannot pay back its energy investment is simply a myth." It concludes that for an investment of one to four years worth of energy output, rooftop systems can provide 30 years or more of clean energy. Other studies sent our way reached similar conclusions. Now, when Alexander provided us with the Energy Bulletin study, he explained in support of his claim that "the answer really depends on so many variables that are often difficult to control" such as materials used to create a solar panel, the type of solar system and where it is located. (He noted that "obviously some parts of the country get a lot more sunlight and cloud cover than others." Perhaps he forgot he’s a lawmaker in Florida, the Sunshine State.) "Given best materials and optimal conditions," he wrote, "there clearly can be energy payback in two to eight years. Given other conditions, the answer is there will not be payback. So, the real answer is it depends on many factors, which is true for all things involving green/clean technologies." Sounds reasonable, right? The only problem is that the study he points to, and others, attempt to control for those variables — and make allowances for them. That’s why the ranges are so wide: from one to four years, or from two to eight. And Alexander’s claim doesn’t contain nearly the flexibility of his followup explanation. He said: "It takes as much energy to make a solar panel as it likely generates in its entire life." By saying "as it likely generates in its entire life," Alexander suggests that he's talking about a typical example of solar panel output, not a fringe case with undefined "other conditions." Thus, our ruling. Alexander’s own evidence says his view "can be rejected," and a mainstream consumer publication call it "simply a myth." But he uses this long-debunked claim to help justify rejecting $13.9 million in federal funds for Floridians. We have no choice other than to focus a little sunlight his way and declare his Pants on Fire.	None	J.D. Alexander	None	None	None	2010-09-28T17:33:47	2010-09-16	['None']
pomt-02661	Buried in the Affordable Care Act is "a huge government bailout."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/13/charles-krauthammer/krauthammer-obamacare-has-hidden-insurance-company/	Bailout has never been a pretty word in politics or business and since the Great Recession, the stigma has only intensified. When Wall Street banks and automakers General Motors and Chrysler were awash in red ink, Washington threw them a $420 billion lifeline (of which $430 billion came back), while the Federal Reserve bought nearly $1.5 trillion worth of toxic mortgage-backed securities. Enter conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer with news of a new bailout. Krauthammer wrote in the Washington Post that "buried deep" in the Affordable Care Act is "a huge government bailout" to cover "up to 80 percent of insurance company losses." Krauthammer is talking about a couple of important pieces in the law that limit insurers’ losses in the first few years of the program. Without those protections, most insurance companies likely would have avoided the government marketplaces where people can pick a health plan. Krauthammer, who is no fan of Obamacare, supports legislation to remove those protections for health insurance providers from the law. "Without viable insurance companies doing the work, it falls apart. No bailout, no Obamacare," he wrote. We wanted to look deeper into Krauthammer’s assertion that these measures are bailouts, akin to the support offered to banks and car makers. A bridge over risky waters The Affordable Care Act does a complete number on the insurance game as Americans know it, at least in the individual and small group markets. Instead of companies making a profit through selling policies to the healthy and avoiding the ill, the law aims to pull carriers into a world where they insure everyone and compete based on efficiency and value. We’re not saying that will necessarily happen, but that’s the goal. In sickness and health and everything in between, that’s the population the insurers must work with. The problem is, if you are an insurance company, how do you decide how much to charge in such a different landscape? Until you have a few years to see who is actually in the pool and how much health care they use, the uncertainty is way beyond your comfort zone. Enter the government and a few tricks to make the risk picture more manageable. The law forces insurers to share some profits and losses across health care plans. Money shifts from companies that paid out less than average in claims to companies that paid out more than average. It’s a permanent program meant to help level the playing field. The law also protects insurers from suffering losses for providing insurance to higher cost customers -- to a point. The program is called reinsurance, and here’s how it works. The law slaps a $63 fee or tax on most policies. That pool of money, which translates to $20 billion between 2014 and 2016, helps insurers pay for claims for people who require more medical attention. The reinsurance program lasts for only three years. A third part of the law, called a risk corridor, is another temporary program meant to mitigate an insurer’s risk. It’s the program that largely drives the concern over potential bailouts. The idea behind the corridor is that the government and insurers share risk for plans offered through the government marketplaces. Like the reinsurance program, it lasts only from 2014-16. Here’s how it works. The government sets financial benchmarks for each plan offered on the marketplace. As long as insurers come close to that benchmark, nothing happens. If an insurer overperforms by up to 3 percent, they can keep the extra revenue. If they underperform by up to 3 percent, they are forced to absorb those additional costs. When the gaps get wider, however, money starts changing hands. If insurers beat their benchmark by 3-8 percent, they have to split that extra revenue with the federal government. If insurers beat the mark by more than 8 percent, the government receives 80 percent of that additional money. On the flip side, when insurers fail to meet their benchmarks the government helps absorb those costs. If insurers underperform by 3-8 percent, the government will cover half the extra cost. The government covers 80 percent of the costs after that. The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number cruncher of Congress, says all of these measures will be budget neutral. Some plans will share gains with the government and some will get checks from the government. Overall, the CBO predicts that the money going out will be matched by the money coming in. However, if the CBO is wrong, there is nothing to stop the money from flowing from the government to private insurers. There is no cap written into the law. The fear among conservatives is that ad hoc changes to the law since it passed could be creating a ripple effect where the marketplace insurance pools have more sick people and losses would rise. Hence, the concern over bailouts. The bailout dispute We asked Krauthammer why he called this a bailout and he said he relied on the definition from Merriam-Webster. "The act of saving or rescuing something (such as a business) from money problems," he quoted. "A rescue from financial distress." Rescue is clearly the operative word. We looked at other definitions. The Palgrave Dictionary of Economics spoke of a rescue from "potential or actual insolvency." Investopedia had to prevent "the consequences that arise from a business's downfall." The country’s recession bailouts fit these definitions nicely. First the private firms were in crisis and then the government stepped in with taxpayer dollars. For Scott Harrington, professor of health care management at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School, Krauthammer’s use of the word in the context of the Affordable Care Act gets the sequence wrong. "Bailouts involve ex post actions to address private sector screw-ups," Harrington said. "That's not what happened here." Although the government could end up writing some large checks, the system was not explicitly set up to do that. Companies are expected to try to make a profit, and they have yet to experience any losses. Mark A. Hall, professor of law and public health at Wake Forest University, took exception to Krauthammer’s statement because Krauthammer writes as though all the money comes from American taxpayers. "A bailout is using general taxpayer revenues to help an industry or interest group," Hall said. "Here, the funding source is mainly from insurers themselves." Mary van der Heijde, a principal and actuary with the health care consulting firm Milliman, told PunditFact that Krauthammer’s term "strikes me as an aggressive characterization." In her view, Krauthammer spoke only to the negative side of the program. "This (risk corridor) provision is applied uniformly, in that both gains and losses are shared with the government," van der Heijde said. "Not just losses." Melinda Buntin, chair of the Department of Health Policy at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, noted that this is not the first time the government has used the risk corridor approach. It was part of the launch of the Medicare Part D prescription drug program. "Under that, insurers have actually incurred higher profits than expected on average and have thus paid money back into the government," Buntin said. Our ruling Krauthammer said the Affordable Care Act contains a hidden government bailout for insurance companies that would cover up to 80 percent of their losses. The health care law does contain several mechanisms to mitigate potential losses for insurance companies, and the government stands to help absorb some losses up to 80 percent. But the government also stands to gain if insurance companies are able to turn profits, and the Congressional Budget Office has projected that the government would neither make nor lose money. Experts we spoke with also took issue with Krauthammer’s use of the term "bailout." In the past decade, bailouts came after private businesses faced a financial crisis. The measures in the Affordable Care Act have a more complicated sequence that include a variety of outcomes. This claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.

pomt-02032	Redskins is "used historically" as "a term of respect."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/04/pete-hegseth/pundit-claims-redskins-historically-used-term-resp/	In the early years of the National Football League, the owner of the Boston Redskins asked his coach to don a headdress on the sideline. The players wore war paint, and a marching band played the fight song "Hail to the Redskins," with broken English lyrics that referenced scalping. Today, the team plays in the nation’s capital, the headdress and war paint long gone. But contention over the team’s "Indian" identity has never been greater. In May, 50 U.S. senators signed a letter urging the Washington Redskins to change its name. Team owner Daniel Snyder isn’t budging, even as colleges and high schools dropped "redskin" mascots over the years and other professional teams abandoned traditions like the Atlanta Braves’ Chief Noc-A-Homa (Knock-A-Homer). Why? Dumping the brand of a storied franchise carries an obvious cost. Still, people who support the nickname offer another defense. "When’s the last time you heard someone use that as a racial slur?" asked Pete Hegseth, a guest panelist on the Fox News show Outnumbered. "It’s not used commonly at all as a racial slur. It’s used historically to refer to — a term of respect to people." In this fact-check, PunditFact will explore the roots of the word redskin, the origins of the team’s name and whether the term was meant as a show of respect. ‘The red people’ How the word formed and evolved is ripe for academic debate, with scholars probing documents, speeches, literature and news articles for its earliest mentions. Redskins team president Bruce Allen cites the work of Ives Goddard, senior linguist emeritus at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Natural History. Allen isolated a line from a 2005 academic journal article that aimed to knock down "unfounded" claims that the word refers to bloody "red skins," or dead American Indians, as proof for bounties. Goddard said the word’s origin is "entirely benign and reflects more positive aspects of relations between Indians and whites." It was not disrespectful, he told us, and originated from the French translation of a Native American idiom to designate racial differences with Europeans. The earliest verified uses of "redskins" come in the mid 18th century in colonial dealings with tribes in Illinois Country. The first recorded public use in English was when President James Madison spoke to a delegation of Indian tribes at President’s House in Washington at the onset of the War of 1812. Madison talked about "the red people who live on the same great island with the white people." Two tribal leaders referred to themselves as "redskins" in response. Goddard further traced the term to an 1815 speech by Meskwaki chief Black Thunder amid peace treaty negotiations. Addressing the governor of the Missouri Territory, Black Thunder said, "I have never injured you, and innocence can feel no fear. I turn to all, redskins and white skins, and challenge an accusation against me." The point of Goddard’s research: The term "redskins" was born as a neutral description of American Indians during a limited, positive time between colonials and some tribal nations. Hegseth went further, though, describing its use as a "a term of respect." Hollywood western culture Nancy Shoemaker, a University of Connecticut history professor who studied the etymology of "red" references to Indians, said she considers Goddard’s work thorough but wished he had tracked the word post-1826. Throughout the rest of the 19th century, she said, the term was deployed by whites in acts of violence against Native Americans. The Redskins team name "was not harking back to French-Meskwaki treaty councils," Shoemaker said. "It was harking back to 19th century use of the word." Some tribes occasionally referred to themselves as "red people," she said, such as Cherokees claiming "red" as a way to differentiate themselves from the whites "they saw as greedy and grasping." Other experts said "red men" was used to reference red body paint worn by tribes. The word’s evolution over the 19th century is not as well researched, though Shoemaker says historians find its disparaging use "kind of obvious." The term carried a negative connotation -- that people of darker skin were inferior -- over the past two centuries, said Sherry L. Smith, a Southern Methodist University history professor. "Pete Hegseth seems to have taken the argument that teams selected Native American sports mascots as a sign of respect for ‘Indians’ and shifted that over to the use of the word ‘redskins’ as a sign of respect," Smith said. "He is simply wrong." The term came up in some 19th century literature, and experts debate whether references are sympathetic or condescending. James Fenimore Cooper used "red men" and "red-skin" throughout his 1820s novels The Pioneers and The Last of the Mohicans to describe Native Americans. To Goddard, the terms are an "affectless designation," an earnest attempt to use the more accurate term compared to "Indian." To others, Cooper is romanticizing native characters in a racist way, treating them as "living relics" doomed to extinction, said Philip J. Deloria, a University of Michigan professor of history and American culture. Clearer derogatory portrayals emerged in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The Wonderful Wizard of Oz author Frank Baum invoked the word in 1890 and 1891 newspaper editorials calling for the extermination of Native Americans. Baum wrote of Sioux leader Sitting Bull’s death in 1890 that "with his fall the nobility of the Redskin is extinguished, and what few are left are a pack of whining curs who lick the hand that smites them." 20th century depictions of war-like, primitive redskins endured in early Hollywood westerns and the 1932 Tom and Jerry cartoon "Redskin Blues," in which the title characters escape an attack on their wagon by Indians (some, for example, appear chubby but are revealed to be Indian women in skimpy dress) thanks to the U.S. military. The "Indian" caricature persisted as American Indians were pushed onto reservations and dealt with a law that banned outward practice of their religions. Experts we consulted were hard-pressed to find "redskin" used in a cut-and-dried show of respect. "That's not to say one might not be able to find an instance of it someplace," Deloria said. "I’d say there's no evidence that it was a common form of discourse, widely understood as a word of value and respect." ‘Hail to the Redskins’ Despite the prevailing depictions of American Indians as "redskins" in the early 20th century, the football team says it chose its name out of respect. "It is a symbol of everything we stand for: strength, courage, pride, and respect -- the same values we know guide Native Americans and which are embedded throughout their rich history as the original Americans," Snyder, the owner, wrote in a 2013 letter to season ticket holders. The team played as the Boston Braves in its first season in 1932. Owner George Preston Marshall chose the Redskins name in 1933 with the team’s move into Fenway Park, home of the Red Sox. Marshall’s motivations remain uncertain, though it’s clear he loved to exploit Native American imagery for games. A known racist, his team was the last to integrate. Team officials have claimed throughout the ongoing legal battle over the team’s trademark that Marshall was honoring its coach, William "Lone Star" Dietz, who claimed Sioux heritage, and the early American Indian players recruited for the team. But Dietz’s heritage is another sore subject, with evidence suggesting he was a German American who assumed a Native American identity. Another theory is Marshall was likely choosing a synonym for "Braves." Indian names had already proliferated throughout sports, chosen to reference hometowns or states, express patriotism or warrior-like strength, or touch on enthusiasm for American Indian athletes like Jim Thorpe, said J. Gordon Hylton, a law professor at Marquette University and University of Virginia and a sports historian. Our ruling This fact-check isn’t about whether the Redskins owner believes his football team’s name is meant to be respectful (that’s his opinion). It’s also not about whether the Redskins name has a place in the 21st century (that’s your opinion). We’re evaluating a claim by a defender of the nickname that the word itself was used as a term of respect. It’s a stretch. Its earliest use was as a racial designation before being used in derogatory portrayals of American Indians in literature, movies and newspapers, and in 19th century clashes between whites and tribal nations. That sentiment extended into 20th century culture. Hegseth’s talking point suggests "redskins" was used as an honorific and doesn’t tell the full story about the word’s historical usage. We rate his claim Mostly False.	None	Pete Hegseth	None	None	None	2014-06-04T13:50:11	2014-05-26	['None']
pomt-01253	"Every single day in this country, 1,000 people are deported and the vast majority of those people that are deported aren't criminals."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/nov/12/jose-diaz-balart/diaz-balart-vast-majority-deportees-arent-criminal/	As part of his post-election analysis, Telemundo news anchor and MSNBC host Jose Diaz-Balart argued that the Hispanic vote remains up for grabs going forward because politicians of both parties seem uninterested in addressing Hispanics’ concerns. "Every single day in this country, 1,000 people are deported and the vast majority of those people that are deported aren't criminals," Diaz-Balart said on NBC’s Meet the Press Nov. 9, 2014. "The people that are being deported many times are family, fathers and mothers and those people don't see anyone in Washington standing up and saying, let's deal with this problem." We’ll stay out of the politics of the issue, but we were curious about Diaz-Balart’s claim that 1,000 people are deported every day and that the vast majority aren’t criminals. Deportation lingo Before we break down the numbers, it’s important to note that officials no longer use the word "deportation" to describe immigration enforcement actions. What we commonly think of as deportation can include two categories -- returns and removals. "The return process is more informal," said Marc Rosenblum, deputy director of immigration policy studies at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research group that counts among its funders the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Carnegie Corporation and the World Bank. "It generally takes place at the border and there’s no judicial order and no real penalty." Basically with a return, a person gets caught and agrees to go back home. Authorities retain a record of their entry and can use that against them if they show up again. Most returns happen right at the border. A removal is more formal. There’s nothing voluntary about it. It comes with an official order, either from a judge or one of two immigration control agencies. If the person is caught again, he or she may face criminal penalties. Based on the numbers he used, Diaz-Balart focused solely on removals in making his comments. In fact, he has talked about these exact removal stats before (without the additional note that the "vast majority" were non-criminal cases). Diaz-Balart’s claim by the numbers Representatives for Diaz-Balart said he relied on data from the Department of Homeland Security. In 2013, according to Homeland Security, more than 438,000 people were subject to removal. That is the highest number ever. Of those, 45 percent faced some kind of criminal charge; 55 percent did not. The following table, based on Homeland Security data, shows the trends during President Barack Obama’s time in office. How do those numbers match Diaz-Balart’s statement? More than 1,000 people per day, on average, have been removed from the country since Obama has been president. In 2013, an average of 1,200 people per day were removed. But non-criminals no longer make up the "vast majority" of removals and have not since 2009, as Diaz-Balart claimed. "It’s not accurate to say that the vast majority are non-criminals," Rosenblum said. "It’s a bare majority." If you include returns in the calculation (178,000 in 2013) Diaz-Balart would be correct that the vast majority are non-criminals but would have understated the daily average of returns and removals by close to 700 per day. A note about those criminals While the percentage of criminal removals is high (45 percent), there’s enough evidence to tell us this category itself should be viewed with care. Homeland Security reports that violations of immigration law represent nearly a third of the cases. Another 15 percent are criminal traffic offenses. We can’t draw a definitive line between minor and more serious offenses. But the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a big data center at Syracuse University, examined cases handled by courts — a subset of all the removal actions — and found about 90 percent of the convictions there have been for illegal entry or re-entry. (In short, these people’s crime is entering the country illegally in the first place.) Kevin Johnson, dean of the University of California-Davis School of Law, said his reading of the record tells him immigration officials define criminality quite broadly. "Throughout the Obama years, the data has shown that removals based on non-criminal or minor criminal offenses, such as driving without a license, have greatly outnumbered the removals of serious criminal offenders," Johnson said. Our ruling Diaz-Balart said that 1,000 people are deported each day and the vast majority are not criminals. Diaz-Balart is right that 1,000 people a day on average are formally removed from the country. In fact, in 2013, it was 1,200 per day. But he reached too far by saying the "vast majority" are not criminals. Strictly speaking, non-criminal removals only slightly outnumber the people removed under the cloud of a criminal charge. Those crimes in many cases include entering the country illegally or overstaying a visa. But they are still crimes. The statement is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.

pomt-10517	Obama says Clinton in 2002 suggested there was a connection between al-Qaida and the Iraqi government.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/12/barack-obama/yes-clinton-used-the-bush-administration-line/	Asked about a new report that found no connection between al-Qaida and the old Iraqi government before the U.S. invasion, Sen. Barack Obama said it shows that Sen. Hillary Clinton had poor judgment in 2002 when she repeated claims from the Bush administration to support its plan to go to war. "President Bush and Dick Cheney insisted there was a connection. Senator Clinton on the floor of the Senate suggested that there was such a connection," Obama said in an interview on MSNBC's Hardball on March 11, 2008. "I think it was part of a series of misjudgments that have not only cost us dearly in terms of lives lost and people who are injured, has distracted us from Afghanistan and our ability to pin down bin Laden and al-Qaida, but has also cost us hundreds of billions of dollars." Clinton's support of the war is well-known, but we wondered if Obama was quoting her correctly about al-Qaida. So we checked the transcript of a speech she gave on Oct. 10, 2002, just hours before the Senate voted to approve the war resolution. In that speech, Clinton explained her reasoning for supporting the war resolution. She described Saddam Hussein as "a tyrant who has tortured and killed his own people" and said that he blocked weapons inspections in 1998. "In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al-Qaida members, though there is apparently no evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of Sept. 11, 2001." In their book Her Way: The Hopes and Ambitions of Hillary Rodham Clinton, Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta Jr. note that Clinton was rare among Democrats in citing the al-Qaida link. The book quotes Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware as saying the links were "much exaggerated," while Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California described them as "tenuous." Gerth and Van Natta point out that Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut came closest to echoing Clinton's comments, but even he said "the relationship between al-Qaida and Saddam's regime is a subject of intense debate within the intelligence community." Clinton was asked to explain her al-Qaida remark during an appearance on Meet the Press on Sept. 23, 2007. She sidestepped the part about al-Qaida but said, "Well, I cast a sincere vote based on my assessment at the time, and I take responsibility for that vote. I also said on the floor that day that this was not a vote for pre-emptive war. I thought it made sense to put inspectors back in. As you recall, Saddam had driven out the U.N. inspectors in 1998 and the situation in Iraq was opaque, hard to determine, and I thought that it made sense to put inspectors back in." She put the blame on the Bush administration. "Now, obviously, if I had known then what I know now about what the president would do with the authority that was given him, I would not have voted the way that I did." Still, Obama has accurately described her statement, so we find his claim True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-03-12T00:00:00	2008-03-11	['Bill_Clinton', 'Iraq', 'Barack_Obama']

Using reading and math scores from the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test may make sense for reading and math teachers, but what about educators who teach electives, language and arts courses? Those subjects do not come with a standardized test. It’s a fundamental flaw in the merit-pay system, one that prompted Gov. Charlie Crist to veto the Republican-led proposal in 2010. Crist’s successor and potential 2014 opponent, Gov. Rick Scott, signed a similar bill into law in 2011. "The results were, unfortunately, as expected," Crist wrote in a Sept. 22 column in the Tampa Bay Times. "Today many Florida teachers are at risk of having their pay impacted by the performance of children who are not even in their classrooms or subject areas." We decided to see if Crist is right: Are Florida teachers "at risk of having their pay impacted by the performance of children who are not even in their classrooms or subject areas"? Under the law, teachers are evaluated based on a scoring system with categories of highly effective, effective, needs improvement and unsatisfactory. (Performance-based evaluations started in the 2011-12 school year but will not be tied to salary increases and job status until the 2014-15 school year, at least statewide.) How districts measure a teacher’s influence is basically up to them. About half of the teacher’s grade is based on student performance. For teachers who teach reading and math in grades tested by the FCAT, the assessment data was pertinent. But for the thousands of teachers who teach other subjects, such as art, music or social studies, or those grades that are not measured by FCAT, districts had to think of another way to gauge their performance. Most went with schoolwide FCAT scores, which measure reading (grades 3-10), math (grades 3-8) and science (grades 5 and 8). The decision was controversial enough that seven teachers, with the backing of the Florida Education Association, sued the state’s education commissioner and board. One plaintiff, Hernando County teacher Bethann Brooks, was evaluated based on reading test scores of freshmen and sophomores, but Brooks taught juniors and seniors health science. In the new system, Brooks’ performance fell from "highly effective" to "effective." As evidence to back up his claim, Crist sent us an April 2013 Washington Post blog post highlighting the lawsuit. But that’s not the latest news on this issue. Sen. Anitere Flores, R-Miami, tried to improve the 2011 law by inserting language in a 2013 bill that said teachers had to be evaluated on the performance their students. But the change was hardly a magic wand. It told districts what not to do, but not how to avoid it. Take Pinellas County, where the school board tried to comply with the new state law by passing a plan that greatly reduced the number of teachers evaluated based on students they did not teach. However, many teachers will continue being evaluated by student scores in subjects they do not teach. Schoolwide reading and math FCAT scores will continue to be used in evaluations for teachers in non-core subjects, such as art, music and physical education, as well as middle and high school science teachers, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Hillsborough County schools were in a better position than most, because the system developed end-of-course exams for all academic subjects including electives a few years ago because of a grant, said district spokesman Stephen Hegarty. In other words, much is still being worked out. Thanks to a $20 million federal grant, Hillsborough, Miami-Dade, Duval and Polk counties are developing assessments for "hard-to-measure" subjects that do not have statewide assessments, including physical education, performing arts, visual arts, world languages, and career and technical education. The result will be a bank of test questions for districts to use for those subjects. The goal is to have an assessment for every subject, said Department of Education spokeswoman Cheryl Etters, but it’s not ready yet. Education groups will continue to push for changes in the evaluation formula so it does not rely so much on test scores in the 2014 legislative session, said Wayne Blanton, executive director of the Florida School Boards Association. "The bottom line is the testing and assessments of teachers have not been fleshed out to the point where everyone in the education community is comfortable with it," he said. Our ruling Crist is echoing a legitimate concern of teachers, administrators, lawmakers and unions of the performance pay law. Crist neglects to mention the Legislature tried to address this in a new law that says teachers can only be evaluated by students in their classrooms. Until more assessments are prepared for more subjects, some teachers, particularly in non-core classes or in grades without assessments, will continue to be evaluated not based on the subjects they teach but on overall student scores in FCAT reading and math. Crist’s point is largely accurate given the first round of evaluations, but a new law aims to reduce the problem. We rate this Mostly True.

pomt-08746	"We have 50 state lobbyists that just lobby the Legislature for money every year."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/aug/30/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-50-state-employees-are-paid-lobby-/	Newly minted Republican nominee for governor Rick Scott is making the rounds on national television promoting his plan to cut state taxes and spending. On MSNBC's The Daily Rundown on Aug. 26, 2010 -- two days after his defeat of rival Bill McCollum -- Scott faced questions from host Chuck Todd about whether the major tax and spending cuts he has suggested are realistic given Florida's budget structure and current tax policy. Todd correctly noted that the state budget has been crafted by Republicans for the last 12 years. Todd, who grew up in Miami, then tried to get Scott to zero in on some specific program that could be cut. "It's a pretty lean and mean government, is it not?" Todd asked. "No," replied Scott. "We have a $70 billion budget. We're not going back and looking at how we spend everything. And for example, we have 50 state lobbyists that just lobby the Legislature for money every year. That's not what state governments ought to be doing." We were intrigued by Scott's specific example of government excess -- his claim about the 50 state lobbyists who "just lobby the Legislature for money every year." So we decided to check it out. Anyone who lobbies the Legislature is required to register with the state, so we started by going to the Florida Legislature's lobbyist directory. State statutes define a "lobbyist" as a "person who is employed and receives payment, or who contracts for economic consideration, for the purpose of lobbying, or a person who is principally employed for governmental affairs by another person or governmental entity to lobby on behalf of that other person or governmental entity." The same statutes define "lobbying" as "influencing or attempting to influence legislative action or nonaction through oral or written communication or an attempt to obtain the goodwill of a member or employee of the Legislature." The definitions could catch a lot of state employees who talk policy or budget with the Legislature on behalf of their agency or department. And when we searched through the 2010 registered lobbyist list, that's exactly what we found. We counted more than 200 state employees who have been registered as lobbyists by the Legislature. A few examples: The Agency for Health Care Administration has eight registered lobbyists. The Department of Children and Family has 31 registered lobbyists. The Department of Education has 10 registered lobbyists. Florida Education Commissioner Eric Smith is listed as a lobbyist, as is Florida Department of Law Enforcement Commissioner Gerald Bailey, Department of Community Affairs Secretary Tom Pelham, Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Mike Sole, and Florida Department of Transportation Secretary Stephanie Kopelousos. So is someone like Secretary of State spokeswoman Jennifer Davis and James Karels, the director of the Division of Foresty under the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. In total, the list includes way more than the 50 state employees Scott claimed on MSNBC. But as we looked at the list, many of the state employees aren't lobbyists in the traditional sense -- meaning that they only lobby the Legislature. We went to the Executive Office of the Governor -- the formal title for Gov. Charlie Crist's office -- to examine the issue in a little more detail. Crist's office includes 40 registered lobbyists, according to the directory. The list includes many employees who work in the Governor's Office of Policy and Budget, the arm of the state executive branch that crafts and reacts to policy proposals and drafts a state budget. Put simply, the governor's sausage makers. That list includes John Mitchell (environmental policy), Jasmin Raffington (transportation and economic development policy), Christian Weiss (economic analysis) and Randy Ball (public safety policy). Then there are folks like Bruce Grant of the Office of Drug Control, JoAnn Carrin of the Office of Open Government, Lucia Fishburne of the Office of Film and Entertainment, and Chris Hart of Office of Tourism, Trade, and Economic Development. And then there's Crist's executive team, which includes chief of staff Shane Strum, and deputy chiefs of staff Ken Granger, Chuck Drago and Jerry McDaniel. "Most of our staff discuss policy before legislative committees and (are) not necessarily there to lobby for money," said governor's office spokesman Sterling Ivey. Later, Ivey added that the governor's office "does not have an employee whose only job is to lobby the Legislature. Anyone lobbying or appearing before committees would have other primary job responsibilities and appearance before the legislature would be a secondary part of their job." All that information left us skeptics. On one hand, Scott's number was awfully low. And also, it seems misleading because it's labeling employees as lobbyists when they get that title more by technicality. So we turned to the Scott campaign for clarity. The campaign provided us with this spreadsheet, which wasn't really clear at all until we got a more detailed explanation. In short, the Scott campaign created a subset of those 200-plus lobbyists, specifically those whose primary or sole responsibility is to work with the Legislature. For many agencies, these positions are often called "Legislative Affairs Director" or something like that. With that information, we started doing our own research. Take, for instance, the Agency for Health Care Administration. The agency has its own Legislative Affairs Office, which "serves as the Agency resource for statutory interaction," according to the AHCA website. "It provides information to legislators and the public about health care legislation. The office also acts as liaison between AHCA staff, legislators, legislative committee staff and industry interests." The office employs three people -- Warren Moore, Jim Alfred and Ashley James -- all of them registered to lobby before the Legislature. Then we searched around the other departments and agencies in Tallahassee. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection has a legislative affairs office, which "includes developing legislation and support information, and finding sponsors for legislation. The Office also serves as the central point of contact for legislators and their staffs for information about the Department's programs," according to its website. The office is headed by Cameron Cooper, who is registered to lobby the Legislature. Grace Lovett is a registered lobbyist and the office's deputy director. The Department of Corrections has three people in its legislative affairs office -- Jason Welty, Tommy Maggitas, Kristen Manalo –- registered to lobby. Rivers H. Buford is the legislative affairs director for the Department of State. Kimberly Case is the legislative affairs director for the Attorney General's office. It turns out most agencies and departments have their own legislative point person. Jim Henry, a registered lobbyist, is the legislative affairs director for the Department of Children and Families. Sunny Phillips at the Department of Community Affairs. Two slots at the Department of Juvenile Justice -- one for Sarah Toms and a vacant director position. The Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation has a legislative director and three legislative affairs coordinators. Three of the four are registered to lobby before the Legislature. There is a director and a deputy director in the legislative affairs office of the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. The Department of Elder Affairs has a legislative affairs director. So does CFO Alex Sink's Department of Financial Services. So does the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Department of Highway Safety & Motor Vehicles has a legislative affairs administrator. The Department of Health has a legislative planning director. The Agency For Workforce Innovation also has a legislative affairs position. The Department of Management Services has a director and deputy director of legislative affairs. Both are registered to lobby. The Department of Veterans' Affairs has a Legislative, External & Cabinet Affairs Director who is registered to lobby. The Department of Education has an office of governmental relations. Its director is registered to lobby in Florida. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission has a legislative affairs office with a director and legislative liaison who are both registered to lobby. The Department of Health employs a director of legislative planning and a deputy secretary for advocacy and policy, both who are registered to lobby. The Department of Revenue has an office of Legislative and Cabinet Services. We found at least two people in the office who are registered lobbyists. The Department of the Lottery has a director of legislative affairs and a senior legislative analyst who are both registered to lobby. That's 37 people we found in a few hours searching who are registered lobbyists for state agencies and departments whose primary responsibility is dealing with the Legislature. And we admit we're likely overlooking some employees at the state department and agency level. Then there are the college and university lobbyists -- technically state employees -- who also lobby the Legislature. The University of Florida employs a director of government relations and an associate vice president of government relations. Both are registered to lobby the Legislature. The University of Central Florida has a director of governmental relations. So does the University of West Florida. The University of North Florida has a vice president for governmental relations. Even non-universities have full-time lobbyists. St. Petersburg College has a government relations director. As does Palm Beach State College. And Miami-Dade College, Valencia Community College, Daytona State College, Edison State College, Pensacola Junior College, and Seminole State College. That's another 13 people, or 50 all together, and again that most likely is just a partial list. (For the record, state law says departments and colleges "may not use public funds to retain a lobbyist to represent it before the legislative or executive branch." However, full time department and college employees "may register as lobbyists and represent that employer before the legislative or executive branch." In other words, the state lobbyist must also be a full time department or college employee). Scott's number is credible. There are at least 50 state employees whose primary responsibility is to lobby the state Legislature. But Scott also said that they "just lobby" for money. That's not true. While lobbyists will no doubt support the budget requests of their specific agency, department or university, they also spend significant time lobbying for policy, and they act as a point person for legislators looking for information about a specific program. It's more than just money, though money is a part of it. For instance, here's how the Department of State's Office of Legislative Affairs describes itself: "The office ... supervises and coordinates the Department's legislative agenda and identifies needed legislation; drafts proposed bills; identifies bill sponsors; tracks departmental legislation and other filed legislation that will potentially impact, positively or negatively, the Department's programs. This information is then used to help educate the Legislature, other state agencies, the Governor's Office and the public to understand how these proposals impact the department's legislative and budgetary goals and objectives. The unit also takes the lead with constituent issues generated by legislative offices that affect the department." Which brings us back to Scott's claim. In a national television interview, Republican gubernatorial candidate Rick Scott said that Florida has "50 state lobbyists that just lobby the Legislature for money every year." There are more than 200 state employees registered as lobbyists in Tallahassee to advocate either for policy or money. And there are at least 50 of them whose primary job is work with the Legislature. But they do more than lobby just for money as Scott suggested. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-08356	Says Scott Bruun supports allowing corporations to secretly funnel millions of dollars to front groups to finance attack ads.	half-true	/oregon/statements/2010/oct/27/jeff-merkley/jeff-merkley-accuses-scott-bruun-supporting-secret/	As anyone watching all the television ads knows, freshman U.S. Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore., faces Republican Scott Bruun in Oregon’s 5th Congressional District. In a fundraising letter on behalf of Schrader last month, U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley describes Bruun -- without naming him -- as a big-bank-loving, middle-class-hating Republican. The letter contains this line: "No wonder Kurt’s opponent has said he supports allowing corporations to secretly funnel millions of dollars to front groups to finance attack ads." Secretly funnel millions? Front groups? Attack ads? It all sounded so very Dr. Evil. PolitiFact Oregon was all over it. Bruun, in line with most other Republicans, supports the U.S. Supreme Court’s 5-4 decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (January 2010). The ruling loosened restrictions, allowing corporations and unions to spend as much money as they want directly from their treasuries to support or oppose a candidate. Before, donations had to come from employees or union members through a political action committee. Also before the ruling, corporations couldn’t spend any money on campaign ads -- the ones that urge a vote for or against a candidate -- within 60 days of a general election. In general, Democrats call the Citizens United ruling a slap to grass-roots democracy. Republicans, who get lots of contributions from corporate interests, say there should be no limits on speech. (The majority held that First Amendment protections should apply to corporations as well.) Asked for evidence that Bruun ever said such a thing, the Merkley campaign offered his response to a question about the Citizens United decision from the League of Women Voters of Oregon guide: "Free speech is messy, noisy and uncomfortable for some. Of course the alternative to free speech is much worse. Political ‘speech’ is the most important form of speech for a free, open and tolerant society. The Supreme Court has ruled and Congress should leave it alone." Nothing there about "secret" millions or "front groups." In fact, Bruun never said any such thing. But we wanted to know if the sentiment behind Merkley’s statement was accurate. In other words, is it fair to say that you favor secret donations to front groups to pay for attack ads if you think Congress should leave Citizens United alone? Citizens United expanded the amount of money allowed and how it can be used, but it was the final nail in a bout of hammering. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court started allowing corporate money into elections by letting groups, including corporations, spend money to run "issue advocacy" commercials. The decision in Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life struck down a portion of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law. And let’s not discount the roles of federal tax law and federal enforcement of elections communications in allowing donations to remain secret. First, the IRS tax code allows 501(c) nonprofit groups to shield donor names even as it allows politically minded nonprofits to engage in political speech. (To compare, political groups identified under IRS tax code 527 must disclose regularly.) Second, the FEC requires disclosure only of corporate money earmarked for "electioneering" -- which few companies do. It’s true there’s been much more money dumped into elections this year, with a lot less disclosure. A Washington Post analysis found that less than half of the total third-party spending this election was disclosed with donors’ identities. "Nothing is greater than the Citizens United decision in opening the floodgates," said Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist for Public Citizen. The nonprofit consumer advocacy group, based in D.C., has urged Congress to pass a disclosure law to fix the ruling. In fact, a host of nonpartisan groups interested in open government called for the same. The national League of Women Voters issued a call earlier this month for television stations to reject ads paid for with secret money. Marge Easley, president of the League of Women Voters of Oregon, wanted to make clear that the nonpartisan group favors neither candidate in the 5th District. But she added that if a candidate is "not in favor of disclosure of campaign funding, then that means they are in favor of keeping things secret." So is Bruun in favor of secrecy or disclosure when it comes to campaign spending? Significantly, Bruun does oppose the Disclose Act, which would have required groups to name donors behind commercial ads. Bruun’s campaign spokeswoman Alee Lockman wrote in e-mails that Bruun supports "transparency & reporting in campaign finance" but disagrees with the way the Disclose Act "is set up." "He is, of course, open to bipartisan discussions about campaign finance regulations, but as he is not in Congress yet, he can’t speculate on what hypothetical legislation he may or may not be presented with," she wrote. Bruun has said he favors Oregon's system, which has no limits on contributions but requires full disclosure of donor information. In sum, as over the top as Merkley’s statement may be, PolitiFact Oregon finds it to be Half True. Comment on this item.	None	Jeff Merkley	None	None	None	2010-10-27T06:00:00	2010-09-17	['None']
pomt-07465	"What we have done with the PATRIOT Act, we've given the government enormous powers. We've given the government the right to reach deeply into people's private lives, into their business affairs, without a court order."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/apr/18/dennis-kucinich/rep-dennis-kucinich-critical-over-reach-patriot-ac/	A vocal opponent of the PATRIOT Act since its passage nearly a decade ago, Rep. Dennis Kucinich has been in the thick of the discussion since Congress teetered on the brink of refusing to renew some key provisions. With the help of Tea Party Republicans the Democratic minority in Congress did, indeed, preempt renewal when the vote went 277 to 148 for a nine-month extension of three key provisions. That was short of the two-thirds majority needed to keep the provisions alive through then end of the calendar year. They came back Feb. 17 and voted for an extension for 90 days to allow further debate. And it passed. Not surprisingly, Kucinich had many things to say, invoking among other things, "The Star Spangled Banner," the spirit of the First Amendment and bi-partisanship in defense of basic liberties. From the floor of the House and in a Feb. 10 press release, he said: "What we have done with the PATRIOT Act, we've given the government enormous powers. We've given the government the right to reach deeply into people's private lives, into their business affairs, without a court order. We need to think about that." Given that the debate will soon be revived as the 90-day extension nears expiration, PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look. The House was debating extensions of three provisions that already expanded the government’s ability to keep an eye on us, and Kucinich rattled them off by the numbers, citing sections 206, 215 and 6001. House Republicans posted the three sections online at the official GOP website. Their legislative digest didn’t quote Kucinich, but didn’t disagree with his reading of the provisions either. "Business Records Provision (the So-Called "Library Provision"—Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act): This provision allows the FBI to apply to the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance court for an order granting access to tangible items—including books, records, papers, and other documents—in foreign intelligence, international terrorism and clandestine intelligence cases." "Roving Wiretaps Provision (Section 206 of the PATRIOT Act): This provision authorizes FISA orders for multipoint or "roving" wiretaps for foreign intelligence investigations. A "roving" wiretap applies to an individual and allows the government to use a single wiretap order to cover any communications device that the suspect uses or may use." "Lone Wolf Provision (Section 6001 of Intelligence Reform Act): This provision amends the definition of "agent of a foreign power" to include individual foreign terrorists who may not be directly affiliated with a foreign power or international terrorist organization. This provision would prevent terrorists who work on their own from escaping surveillance simply because they are not agents of a foreign power or avowed members of an international terrorist group. This provision ONLY applies to foreign terrorists or agents of a foreign power." So do the extensions of these three provisions allow the government to reach more deeply into people’s lives? Yes, though the third one, the Lone Wolf provision, only applies to "foreign terrorists or agents of a foreign power." Language in Sections 215 and 206, two Kucinich specifically cited, enables federal investigators to gain access to things like library records, e-mails and financial papers and to wiretap multiple communications devices. But can it be done without a court order, as the congressman said? Kucinich and other critics of provisions in the PATRIOT Act decry that the law allows for warrant-less searches. Federal law enforcement officials do not have to go the regular route to obtain court authorization to conduct searches and collect evidence. In those cases the court’s orders would ultimately become public. The sections cited in the PATRIOT Act allow federal law enforcement to apply to a court for an order, but it’s through a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which operates very differently than other U.S. courts. In the case of these special courts, the proceedings are conducted behind closed doors and kept secret. Kucinich is correct that the PATRIOT Act opens the door for government to conduct broad levels of surveillance into U.S. citizens’ lives and activities and that the surveillance can be without traditional law enforcement having to get the traditional warrant. But the law does require an order from a court, albeit a special court that can do so secretly. That’s an important detail. On the Truth-O-Meter, Kucinich’s claim rates as Half True.

pomt-08236	"Rick Scott got a majority of the Hispanic vote in Florida."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/nov/15/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-rick-scott-won-florida-hispanic-vote/	On a swing through Florida to promote his presidential memoir, Decision Points, George W. Bush was joined by his brother Jeb to talk about the Bush family name, the 2010 midterm elections and the upcoming 2012 presidential election. Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, reiterated that he would not run for president in 2012 -- despite pleas from his brother -- and that he wasn't interested in becoming the chairman of the Republican National Committee, either. "I'm Switzerland as it relates to national Republican politics," Bush told CNN's Candy Crowley in an interview that aired Nov. 14, 2010. Yet Jeb -- who is 57, and seven years younger than the former president -- still was quick to talk politics when the issue turned to the results of the 2010 midterm elections. The topic -- why Latino or Hispanic voters voted 2-to-1 for Democrats over Republicans, according to Crowley. "That's some problemo," George W. Bush started, when hearing Crowley's figure (Another transcript recorded Bush as saying, "Es un problema"). After some back and forth, Jeb provided a bit of nuance to the debate over whether Republicans can attract Hispanic voters by talking about the race for governor in Florida. "Rick Scott got a majority of the Hispanic vote in Florida. We elected two Hispanic governors, Susana Martinez and Brian Sandoval (Martinez was elected governor in New Mexico and Sandoval in Nevada.) There were congressmen and women elected of Hispanic origin," said Jeb, who speaks Spanish fluently and whose wife is Mexican. "I think the problem is not just a West Coast problem but it is a big-time California problem. And I think a part of it relates to tone. "If you're watching TV, and someone is kind of legitimately angry that we can't control our border, and sending signals that it's them and us, and, by the way, you're not 'us,' you're 'them,' it doesn't matter what else, people turn out. If they (don't) feel like they're welcome, they're not going to listen to the message. "Hispanics want the border controlled," Jeb added. "A great nation has to control its border for national security purposes, for all sorts of purposes. And no one has -- I don't know anybody that says, 'Yes, let's just open up our border to create chaos.' So once the border is controlled and people view it that way and there's a perception, it's benchmarked and people say, 'Yes,' then I think you're going to find that there is ground to change our immigration policy to help us grow faster as a nation and to welcome people that work hard and play by the rules to create prosperity for us." If Hispanic voters overwhelmingly supported Democrats nationwide, we wondered if Jeb was right that the script was flipped in Florida, where Republican Rick Scott narrowly defeated Democrat Alex Sink in the race for governor. There's no official certified count of who Hispanic or Latino voters supported in any given election, so Jeb and others rely on exit polling data. The data is just like it sounds -- researchers interview people after leaving the polling place and try, using a sample of the electorate, to replicate the voter turnout by gender, race, age and other characteristics. Exit polling measures how people voted but also tries to figure out why. Like any other poll, exit polling has a margin of error. This year's national and Florida exit polling was conducted by Edison Media Research for the National Election Pool. Researchers interviewed 3,185 voters in Florida at 45 polling places on election day and also included a telephone poll of absentee and early voters. The bottom-line numbers back the Bush brothers up. Democrats had a nearly 2-to-1 advantage -- 64 percent to 34 percent -- over Republicans in U.S. House races among Latino or Hispanic voters, according to the data. Yet the same exit polling data said Scott defeated Sink in Florida among Hispanic voters 50 percent to 48 percent. You can see the 50-48 split in this Miami Herald report or in this report crated by the the Pew Hispanic Center, which studied the Hispanic 2010 vote. The Sink-Scott race itself was extraordinarily close, so Hispanic voters were about as divided as everybody else. But if you're from Florida, and you're a Bush, you should know to be at least a little leery of exit polling (See, 2000). Joe Lenski, executive vice president of Edison Media Research, told PolitiFact Florida that the Scott/Sink split of the Hispanic vote has a 7 percentage point margin of error. Statistically, that means it is entirely possible Sink won the Hispanic vote. Or Scott. Or that it was a razor-thin margin. The large margin of error is because while researchers interviewed more than 3,000 voters, they only spoke with 332 people who identified themselves as Hispanic. In its methods statement accompanying the results, Edison Media Research specifically said that "characteristics for minority racial groups will have larger sampling errors." "The exit polls are always taken like gospel, but they are a survey," Lenski said. In this case, the percentages could swing on just a handful of votes. By our calculation, if four voters said they voted for Sink and not Scott, Sink would have won the Hispanic vote, according to exit polling. For the record, Lenski attributes Scott's performance among Hispanic voters in large part to the Cuban vote. Lenski said Scott carried Cuban voters 68-32 percent, while Sink won the non-Cuban Hispanic vote 65-33. Those numbers also have large margins of error. But the gap is easily outside those margins. Which brings us back to Jeb Bush, who said Rick Scott won a majority of the Hispanic vote in his close victory for governor. Bush was trying to make the point that some Republicans were successful in attracting Hispanic voters. And on that broader point he's right. Scott far outperformed most Republicans across the country when it comes to Hispanic or Latino voters. But it's a stretch to say he definitively won the majority of Hispanic voters. Exit polling shows that Scott carried the Hispanic vote 50-48, but the poll itself comes with a 7 percentage point margin of error, which means it's impossible to make a broad declaration of victory for either candidate. The margin of error too often gets lost in translation or political headlines. But not for us. We rate this statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-14006	Says Donald Trump "has the gall to say that prisoners of war like John McCain aren’t heroes."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/03/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-attacks-donald-trump-over-his-war-/	Hillary Clinton accused Donald Trump of disrespecting veterans in a scathing speech, just days after Trump made headlines by giving $5.6 million in donations to 40 veterans groups. "He says climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese, and he has the gall to say that prisoners of war like John McCain aren’t heroes," Clinton said in her June 2, 2016, speech. In a separate fact-check, we rated the climate change claim Mostly True. Here, we’ll take on the claim about McCain. It dates back to a Trump an event in Ames, Iowa, on July 18, 2015. Trump, referring to McCain, R-Ariz., said "he’s not a war hero." McCain spent five and a half years in a Vietnamese prison camp. Trump’s comments were criticized by many of his then-competitors for the Republican presidential nomination. Texas Gov. Rick Perry, for example, said Trump was "unfit" to be commander-in-chief for his remarks — the very point Clinton aimed to make throughout her speech. Since then, Trump has claimed repeatedly that his statements were misinterpreted. We have looked at Trump’s statements before, but we wanted to re-examine the issue to see whether Clinton’s characterization of Trump’s words is accurate. The feud The bad blood between McCain and Trump started on July 16, 2015, when McCain said Trump had "fired up the crazies" at an Arizona anti-immigration rally. A few days later in Iowa, Trump fired back during an interview with Republican pollster Frank Luntz. Trump accused McCain of not doing enough for veterans and proceeded to call McCain a "loser," at which point Luntz expressed incredulity, noting multiple times that McCain was a war hero. Here’s the back-and-forth: Luntz: "He’s a war hero. He’s a war hero …" Trump: "He’s not a war hero ..." Luntz: "He’s a war hero." Trump: "He is a war hero ..." Luntz: "Five and half years in a Vietnamese prison camp …" Trump: "He’s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured. So he’s a war hero …" Luntz: "Do you agree with that?" Trump: "He’s a war hero, because he was captured, okay? I believe, perhaps, he’s a war hero. But right now he said some very bad things about a lot of people. So what I said is John McCain, I disagree with him that these people aren’t crazy." Clinton would certainly be correct accusing Trump of saying McCain is not a war hero, which he does right off the bat. Trump does attempt to walk it back immediately, but he does so with caveats that continue to question McCain’s service -- suggesting he is only a war hero because he was captured -- and seemingly mock captured soldiers. Also, in a press conference immediately after the rally, Trump insisted he was not blaming McCain for being captured. On a radio show May 11, 2016, Trump also said McCain is a hero. "You know frankly, I like John McCain, and John McCain is a hero," Trump said on the Imus in the Morning radio show. In an interview on the O’Reilly Factor on July 20, 2015, Trump told Bill O’Reilly that he would "take back his remarks" if there was a "misunderstanding," adding that he has since corrected them to express what he meant. Clinton’s comments Clinton’s remarks can be interpreted in different ways. On the one hand, Trump did call McCain, a POW, "not a hero," even if Trump has since distanced himself from that position. However, Clinton’s remarks have a broader interpretation as well — that Trump has made a general statement against POWs being heroes, with McCain as an example. That insinuation is present in what Trump said, as the Clinton press office and spokesman Zac Petkanas pointed out. "I like people who weren’t captured, okay?" Trump said at the initial Iowa rally. But Trump has repeatedly offered statements that support POWs more broadly. In the press conference immediately after the rally, Trump said that all prisoners are war heroes, with the exception of Bowe Bergdahl. "If a person is captured, they’re a hero as far as I’m concerned, unless they are a traitor," Trump said. Trump also explained his comments about liking veterans who weren’t captured, saying that soldiers, both captured and not-captured, deserve credit. "You have many people who didn’t get captured, I respect them greatly. You have many people who did get captured, I respect them greatly also," Trump said. Trump also pivoted back to his main talking point -- that McCain has failed to advocate for veterans in the Senate (a statement we have previously rated False). Our ruling Clinton accused Trump in a speech Thursday of having "the gall to say that prisoners of war like John McCain aren’t heroes." In one sense, she has a point. Trump did in fact say that John McCain is not a hero despite his POW record, although Trump has since taken those comments back and called McCain a hero. However, Clinton’s speech was intended to more broadly attack Trump’s national security credentials, yet Trump has never made the general statement that POWs are not heroes, even if his McCain-specific comments did insinuate it. In fact, he has insisted to the contrary on multiple occasions.

pomt-02205	Last election, the Koch brothers "spent three times what the top 10 unions spent combined."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/23/doonesbury/doonesbury-says-koch-brothers-outspent-unions-3-1/	The billionaire Koch brothers, Charles and David, have become titans of money in politics. The two personally have given over $3.2 million to federal candidates and parties over the past 15 years. But that sum represents just a sliver of their ability to bring cash to bear. By one count, they spent over $400 million during the 2012 elections alone through a series of affiliated and hard-to-track groups. This Sunday, the comic strip Doonesbury took aim at brothers Charles and David. The character Kim bemoaned the impact of the Supreme Court on campaign money. "You know, the Roberts court really did screw us over with Citizens United," she said to Mike Doonesbury, speaking about the U.S. Supreme Court and a decision that allows corporations and unions to contribute unlimited amounts of money to political campaigns. "Last election cycle, a pair of nasty billionaires spent three times what the top 10 unions spent combined." "You mean David and Charles Koch? The respected civic-minded job-creators?" asked Mike. It might be a comic strip, but Doonesbury certainly reaches plenty of eyeballs. And in this case, the claim is no laugher. We can fact-check whether the Koch brothers themselves spent three times as much as the top 10 unions in the last election. We asked Doonesbury creator Garry Trudeau where he got his numbers, and he pointed us to a couple of articles. One from the Huffington Post tied the two men to a total of $490 million. The other from Republic Report, a liberal investigative project, found that the top 10 unions (based on their donations) accounted for $153 million. That’s actually a little more than a 3 to 1 difference. "I rounded it in Kochs’ favor for rhetorical purposes," Trudeau said. But the numbers aren’t so simple. In fact, after talking to independent experts, we could not find an apples-to-apples comparison that included all the Koch brothers’ spending and all the union spending that ranges from local to federal races, and from supporting a candidate to supporting a cause. A limited comparison is possible, and we’ll get to that in a bit, but when it comes to tracking Koch money, the two brothers have set up a Byzantine network of nonprofits that make it impossible to know how much of their own money they have put into the game. The Koch brothers' spending We can say for sure that the $490 million Trudeau cited came from more people than just Charles and David Koch. It included campaign contributions from Koch Industries political action committees and from Koch Industries employees. In fact, the article itself doesn’t contend that all the money came from the Kochs. It called it part of the "Koch network." "I saw that claim in Doonesbury and was surprised by it," Lloyd Hitoshi Mayer, a University of Notre Dame Law School professor who studies political nonprofits, told us. "Trudeau may have mistakenly overestimated the amount attributable to the Koch brothers." Mayer noted that financial records show that at least $39 million spent by the Koch-affiliated group Americans for Prosperity came from donors other than the Kochs. The biggest share, $407 million, came from the Koch’s unusual network of nonprofits. This network has been the focus of intensive research. The Washington Post and the Center for Responsive Politics, a group that tracks money in politics, sifted through 17,000 tax records to piece together how the Koch network deploys its funds. Its signature method is to create what are called "disregarded entities." These are nonprofits that totally mask the people behind them. Robert Maguire is the center’s lead investigator. "We haven’t found a network of organizations like this anywhere else," Maguire said. "The Koch brothers have mobilized this money and the amount is incomparable, even relative to other conservative funding organizations." Maguire and the nonprofit investigative journalism organization ProPublica have documented how the legal structure of this network allows the Koch brothers to exercise a great deal of control over how this money is spent. The Kochs organize regular meetings where they invite donors who share their policy goals to join with them in common purpose. Managers and lawyers with strong ties to the Kochs play a key role in running this network. But so far, the corporate veil remains impenetrable. That means while the Kochs control the purse strings, the money doesn’t all come out of their pocket. "We have no idea how much of the money comes from the Kochs," Maguire said. The union spending There are difficulties, too, in trying to calculate spending by unions. We found a variety of totals for union political spending, although only the one cited by Trudeau exclusively tallied up the activities of the top 10. Remember, Doonesbury compared the Kochs to that smaller group. One of the problems is the national unions give money, but so do their local affiliates. Some of that spending is on candidates and parties, and some is on lobbying. A comparable analysis on the Koch Industries side would include similar spending by its 12 companies and their subsidiaries. We did not find anything like that. The Huffington Post estimated total union spending on elections and lobbying nationwide at $1.7 billion. It cautioned that this probably included double counting. The Republic Report had a total for the top 10 unions of $153 million. To further complicate the picture, the unions also give through third-party organizations that don’t reveal their donors. However, in this arena, unions face some special reporting requirements. A Huffington Post analysis found that a pro-Democrat group, Patriot Majority USA, received about $2.26 million from unions in 2012. We would also note that when it comes to action on the ground in elections, unions can deploy hundreds of volunteers in a single city -- a way to influence the political process that the Kochs cannot match. Volunteers are not campaign spending, but they are a key tool in the political process. The lone apples-to-apples comparison We know there are holes in the data, both on the Koch and union sides. We don’t know how big those holes are, but there is one narrow part of the political world where we can find reliable data. Federal elections offer the most uniform framework for tracking campaign money. There is information on donations to candidates, parties and political action committees, and information on expenditures. Once the Center for Responsive Politics figured out the names of the many nonprofits in the Koch network, it was able to spot when those dollars showed up in the federal database or tax documents. In 2012, the center found that groups in the Koch network, so-called social welfare organizations with 501(c)(4) tax status, spent $170 million, and $86 million of that had come through the Koch network's main donor organizations. The comparable number for all the union groups, those with a 501(c)(5) tax status, was $24 million. "We can trace $86 million back to the top of the Koch network," Maguire said. "The magnitude far exceeds the total for the liberal and union groups." Again, this is not total spending. It is just a comparison where the kind of organizations and the use of the money are matched as closely as possible. In other words, for this sort of political money tracked at the federal level, the network linked to the Koch brothers spent three and a half times more than the unions. We contacted Koch Industries for a response to Trudeau’s claim and did not hear back. Our ruling Doonesbury, aka Garry Trudeau, said the Koch brothers spent three times more than the top 10 unions combined in the 2012 elections. The information came from sources that attempted to track the political giving of the Kochs and the biggest unions. But there are some complications with the numbers. On the Koch side, the sources Trudeau cited did not say that all of the money connected to David and Charles Koch was their personal money. The Kochs have played a key role in creating a unique legal mechanism to raise and spend money that obscures the ultimate donors, and the nature of that mechanism gives them a high level of of control over how it is spent. To some extent, unions also feed into third-party money operations. And union political activity is spread much wider and among more organizations than the Kochs’ giving. In short, a true apples-to-apples comparison is quite difficult. That said, one independent analysis of trackable federal data found organizations tied to the Kochs spent three and a half times what unions did in 2012. How does all of this shake out? Trudeau goes too far in ascribing all of the money to the Kochs but the ratio he offers is in the ballpark of what we can determine at the federal level. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-12186	In economic growth, "Obama's best year was slower than Bill Clinton's worst year."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2017/jul/27/newt-gingrich/was-barack-obamas-best-economic-year-worse-bill-cl/	How bad was the economy under President Barack Obama? Pretty bad, argues former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. In economic growth, "Obama's best year was slower than Bill Clinton's worst year," Gingrich told Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo on July 23, 2017. "That's astonishing." We’ve previously looked at why it’s so hard these days for the United States to sustain 3 percent annual economic growth — a benchmark President Donald Trump says the country can again reach with his leadership. But we wondered whether the difference in economic performance under the two most recent Democratic presidents was so stark. We found that Gingrich’s talking point is correct, though he leaves out some important context. Annual economic growth is typically measured by the change, up or down, in gross domestic product from year to year, after adjusting for inflation. This data is collected by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a federal office. As it turns out, Clinton had two years tied for last place -- 1993 and 1995. In both years, GDP grew by 2.7 percent. As for Obama, his best annual showing came in 2015, with 2.6 percent. In the following chart, the worst Clinton years and the best Obama year are marked in blue. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com So by the primary measure, Gingrich’s statement is correct. However, it’s worth noting that a related statistic shows the record on Obama’s watch in a somewhat more favorable light. Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, said that GDP growth depends on two major factors -- how productive workers are, and how many workers there are. And Clinton was blessed with a worker population that was growing much faster than it later would under Obama. When Clinton was president, Burtless said, the population between the ages of 15 and 64 increased by 1.2 percent a year. Under Obama, the increase was just 0.6 percent. "So it seems to me a bit absurd to compare overall GDP growth in the two administrations without somehow accounting for the different rates of growth in the population," Burtless said. It’s possible to use a variant on our previous metric — GDP growth per capita — that lessens this problem. Here’s what that measurement looks like: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Using this measurement, Obama exceeded Clinton’s worst annual performance during four years (2010, 2012, 2014, 2015). In other words, while Clinton still did better overall when population growth is taken into account, the Obama administration had a better experience using this metric than is implied by Gingrich's statement, Burtless said. Gingrich’s office did not reply to an inquiry. Our ruling Gingrich said that in economic growth, "Obama's best year was slower than Bill Clinton's worst year." Measured by the annual change in inflation-adjusted GDP -- the typical measurement -- Gingrich is correct. But it’s worth noting that if you strip out the impact of population growth, the Clinton-Obama comparison is more mixed. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-07358	From 2008 to 2011, "the pages in the conforming bills have gone from 400 pages to 2,200."	true	/florida/statements/2011/may/07/jack-latvala/senator-rails-against-growing-conforming-budget-bi/	A group of state senators temporarily threw the Florida Legislature into upheaval on May 6, 2011, after several Republicans joined Democrats in opposing a pair of bills that were tied to the $69.7 billion budget. The bills -- called conforming bills -- generally provide language to carry out how the Legislature wants money in the budget to be spent. But leaders in the House and Senate also tacked on two substantive bills to deregulate several professions, including interior designers. On top of that, senators had just hours to read the bills -- 43 of them -- and then cast votes. So, senators put their collective foot down. A bill to deregulate interior designers died in the Senate 32-6. Another conforming bill died 21-18. State Sen. Jack Latvala, who previously served in the Senate from 1994-2002 and was elected again in 2010, took to the floor early in the morning on May 7 to decry the entire process. "I don't really want to get into winners and losers. I think that winners and losers, which ever way they interpret it, are the people of Florida," Latvala said. "There is one lesson I hope we learn. When I left the Florida Senate in 2002, the (conforming) bill was 11 or 12 pages. Sen. (Thad) Altman recently counted the number of pages for the implementing bill in 2008, it was 400 pages. I mean, conforming bills. Sen. Altman also counted the pages in the conforming bills this year -- 2,200. "In three years, the pages in the conforming bills have gone from 400 pages to 2,200," he said. Talking directly to Senate President Mike Haridopolos, Latvala then said: "I pray that when we have the closing night of our session next year that your leadership will show us that we can turn the clock back on that trend." Latvala's numbers -- courtesy of Altman -- may sound staggering. But they're pretty much right. House and Senate leaders proposed 43 conforming bills to go alongside their nearly 500-page budget. We counted the pages of each of the bills. Some takeaways: * A government reorganization bill, SB 2156, was so big that we couldn't download it onto our computer in an Adobe Acrobat version. We had to open a different version of the bill to find out that it includes 20,990 lines of text -- which would translate to about 740 pages; * A growth management bill, HB 7207, measured 349 total pages; * The smallest conforming bill was just two pages. It eliminated the cybercrime unit in the Attorney General's office. In total, we counted 2,170 pages of conforming bills (the specific number can vary slightly based on the exact number of pages in the government reorganization bill). Compare that to 2008, when there were 29 conforming bills and a total of 499 pages. We built a spreadsheet so you can see the difference between the years for yourself. Latvala said that from 2008-2001, "the pages in the conforming bills have gone from 400 pages to 2,200." We rate this claim True.

pomt-11195	"There are some counties in Texas where the first day of hunting, you have to shut down the schools because people are going to go hunting."	false	/texas/statements/2018/may/16/lupe-valdez/lupe-valdez-says-texas-schools-some-counties-shut-/	The former Dallas County sheriff running for governor made us wonder about Texas schools that shut down when it’s hunting time. We failed to find evidence for Lupe Valdez’s claim, although state law permits school districts to manage their own calendars so it’s possible for a district to declare a holiday for a community activity (including hunting) so long as schools stay open long enough through the year. Valdez faces Houston investor Andrew White in a May 22, 2018 Democratic primary runoff with the victor facing Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in November. She was asked in a May 8, 2018 Facebook Live interview by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram editorial board if she still carries her service firearm and how she believes gun laws should change. Valdez, who favors universal background checks for gun purchases, replied: "You know, I believe in the Second Amendment. I believe in all the amendments. And I continue to carry my weapon. That’s part of my morning routine. It’s been for over 40 years. Valdez went on to say that a person "who cannot solve their issues by other than total violence should never be allowed to carry a weapon." Next came her hunting claim. Valdez said: "There are some counties in Texas where the first day of hunting, you have to shut down the schools because people are going to go hunting. That’s a source of sports for them. But that isn’t a source of violence for the majority of those folks." Valdez’s campaign didn’t respond to our inquiries about the basis for her hunting claim. Agencies, school districts unaware of hunting holidays When we queried the Texas Education Agency, spokeswoman Lauren Callahan responded that districts set their own calendars. State law requires each district to operate for at least 75,600 minutes a school year unless the state education commissioner grants permission to run short. "While districts may consult agency staff for guidance as they adopt a local calendar, they do not submit the calendars to us for approval once they are adopted," Callahan said by email. At the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department, Steve Lightfoot replied by email that in 2018, the Texas dove hunting and deer hunting seasons begin on Saturdays--Sept. 1 and Nov. 3, respectively. The Parks & Wildlife Commission, Lightfoot said, "supports providing opportunities to get youth involved in Texas’s rich hunting traditions, and sets aside youth-only weekends for that reason. I checked with staff who would know and they are unaware of schools or districts that close in recognition of hunting season," Lightfoot said. We also connected with Don Rogers, executive director of the Texas Rural Education Association; Rogers told us he was about to huddle with directors of the state’s regional education service centers. After that meeting, Rogers said by phone that none of the directors was aware of a district currently calling a holiday at the start of a hunting season. By phone, we also came up empty with a pair of Central Texas districts in hunting communities. James Payne of the Llano Independent School District said he’s worked in varied districts for 26 years and not heard of a district taking a holiday for the sake of a hunting season. "Do you think she was saying that in jest?" Payne said. Duane Limbaugh, superintendent of the Brady ISD, said that district doesn’t take a day off for the sake of hunting though he’s heard of districts declaring a staff work day for the start of a hunting season. In his experience, he said, most student hunters get their hunting done in time to be in school by mid-morning. Our ruling Valdez declared: "There are some counties in Texas where the first day of hunting, you have to shut down the schools because people are going to go hunting." We didn’t learn how Valdez reached this conclusion, for which we found no confirmation. We rate this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-10620	"Congress just passed another huge, pork-filled spending bill. The Democrats allowed less than a day to read all 3,400 pages and stuffed it with nearly 10,000 earmarks costing about $10-billion dollars."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/16/john-mccain/more-in-the-8-billion-range/	One reason John McCain is so unpopular with fellow senators is his relentless, high-volume crusade against pork — specifically the earmarks for local projects that lawmakers are fond of tucking into annual congressional spending bills. So it was hardly surprising that McCain chose to showcase his fiscally conservative credentials in the days before the Michigan primary by assailing Democratic congressional leaders for loading the year-end fiscal 2008 omnibus spending bill with money for local projects. "Congress just passed another huge, pork-filled spending bill. The Democrats allowed less than a day to read all 3,400 pages and stuffed it with nearly 10,000 earmarks costing about $10-billion dollars," McCain said in remarks delivered to the Americans for Prosperity Michigan summit in a Detroit suburb. The bill McCain cites is the $555-billion package of 11 unfinished spending bills that Congress bundled together and cleared in a crush of last-minute business in mid-December. While the general thrust of McCain's remarks are correct, he's exaggerating some facts to drive home his point. It's technically correct that the Senate had less than a day to read the final version of the legislation; 10 hours and 11 minutes elapsed between when the House voted on a rule adding 10 spending bills to the State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill the evening of Dec. 17 and when the Senate first voted on the package the next afternoon. But while McCain's point is well taken, it's not at all uncommon for major legislation to be completed and turned around on short notice at the end of a congressional session before lawmakers can read it line-by-line. Frequently, members and senators vote with the understanding their party leaders have negotiated or signed off on the most significant details. The bill itself was 613 pages — hardly light reading, but nowhere near the 3,400 pages McCain depicts. In fairness, McCain might have been referring to accompanying conference reports and other documents that detail House-Senate negotiations on the package. McCain also appears to be leaning on the scale in detailing the number of earmarked projects. A preliminary analysis by Taxpayers for Common Sense, which makes a practice of closely tracking earmarks, puts the number of projects in the package at 8,983 worth $7.4-billion. If one adds a fiscal 2008 defense spending bill that Congress passed as a stand-alone measure, the total grows to 11,144 earmarks worth $15.3-billion. The group says it's still scouring conference reports and other documents to establish a final number. But it's misleading to blame the pork just on Democrats. The Republicans learned how to pack the pork when they ran Congress and they got plenty in this bill, too. Though earmarking remains hugely popular, lawmakers are being more discreet about their requests due to a new lobbying and disclosure law that changed Senate rules. It requires that all earmarks and their sponsors, including those in conference reports, be identified on the Internet at least 48 hours before the Senate votes. Earmarks added in conference — known as airdropped provisions — can be challenged through points of order. Watchdog groups report Democrats have tried to make good on a pledge they made upon assuming control of Congress to limit the number of earmark-funded projects. Not surprisingly, McCain fails to note that his own party turned the appropriations process into a veritable earmark mill during the GOP's 12 years in power. "There are a lot of self-proclaimed fiscally conservative Republicans who take earmarks," said Keith Ashdown, chief investigator for the watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense, adding that McCain has walked his talk by refraining from making requests for local projects. The gist of his charge is true about spending, but his numbers are off and it's misleading to suggest all the parochial spending is being done by Democrats. When we add it up, we get Half-True.

pomt-10514	Both McCain and Bush favor tax breaks for oil companies.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/17/campaign-defend-america/mccain-voted-against-bushs-energy-bill/	An ad from the Campaign to Defend America attacks Sen. John McCain as being the same as President George W. Bush on a number of issues, including Iraq, taxes and health care . It also bashes the two on energy policy. "Oil companies, they get tax breaks while we pay at the pump. McSame as Bush," the ad states. The Bush administration's signature energy initiative was the Energy Policy Act of 2005, a major piece of legislation that included subsidies and incentives for several sectors of the energy industry, including oil companies. It was the first national energy legislation in more than a decade, and the Bush administration worked for several years to get it passed. We ruled previously that the bill contained significant measures to encourage clean energy . To be sure, the bill still had its detractors. Some people felt it included too many incentives for industry and too little to help consumers. Those detractors included McCain. "This bill does little to address the immediate energy crisis we face in this country," he said in a statement his Senate office issued at the time. "The handouts to big business and oil companies are irresponsible and will be disastrous for the people of Arizona. I cannot in good conscience vote to pass legislation that does not adequately address issues related to energy efficiency, security, and energy independence." The statement noted that McCain liked the plan's reliability standards and incentives for new refinery capacity, but concluded that the bad outweighed the good. McCain also said he opposed it because it might make pump prices higher with its mandates for the increased use of ethanol. On the final vote on the bill, McCain was one of 26 senators who voted against it. ( Hillary Clinton also opposed it while Barack Obama voted for it. ) The McSame ad doesn't mention this legislation specifically, but it was a priority of the Bush administration and a notable source of tax breaks for the oil and gas industry. McCain opposed it. You can't call them the "McSame" for such a significant difference. For this reason, we find the statement False.

pomt-09846	Pregnant women trying to buy health insurance on their own are barred from maternity coverage because they have a "pre-existing condition."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/18/j-james-rohack/ama-president-says-pregnant-women-are-barred-buyin/	You've probably heard of "pre-existing conditions," which provide an escape clause for health insurance companies. If you have a pre-existing condition, an insurance company typically won't pay for treatment. J. James Rohack, president of the American Medical Association, cited them when he was asked during an appearance on Fox News Sunday on Aug. 16, 2009, whether the Democratic health plan would lead to rationing for older patients. "Well, there's a myth that rationing doesn't occur right now," Rohack said. "In the United States, if a woman's pregnant and on the individual market (and) tries to get health insurance, that's called a pre-existing condition and it's not paid for. That's why this bill's important. It gets rid of some of the rationing that's occurring right now." The AMA endorsed the House version of health care reform legislation in July. First, we should emphasize that he's only talking about the relatively small number of women who buy their coverage through what insurers call the individual market. About two-thirds of women have health insurance through their employer or their spouse's employer, and about 13 percent have public coverage such as Medicaid or military health care. So the people affected by these limitations include the 19 percent now uninsured and the 6 percent that have coverage purchased on the individual market. These policies are sold directly to an individual by a private insurer, and the purchaser doesn't get the same consumer protections routinely given to those who have coverage through an employer. For example, people in employer-based health plans have benefited from requirements for maternity coverage that date back to the federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978. But individual plans are not included under that umbrella and are regulated state by state. In 39 states, listed here , insurers can turn down anyone for virtually any reason. It can be because you have a pre-existing condition, like cancer or diabetes. And pregnancy almost always counts too, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which represents the state government officials who regulate insurance sold within their borders. So if you're pregnant and living in one of these 39 states, you're very likely out of luck in securing individual health coverage. You'll have to pay for your care out of your own pocket or seek out charitable assistance. And the coverage isn't much better in the remaining 11 states. These states have "guaranteed issue" laws that say insurers cannot turn applicants down based on their health or risk status. But there's a caveat: Even if an insurer must offer you a plan, it can place exclusions on what the plan covers. Typically, the NAIC says, these exclusions last from six to 12 months, which rules out most or all maternity coverage. (After the exclusion expires, the insurer does have to cover those conditions, meaning that a subsequent pregnancy could be covered.) One category of individual policyholders has it slightly better ? those who leave an employer's plan that had given them uninterrupted coverage for the pre-existing condition in question. Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, people in this category can obtain a plan that covers their pre-existing condition once they have exhausted their old employer's coverage under the law known as COBRA. However, a state only has to provide a minimum of one "HIPAA plan" within its borders, rather than requiring that every insurer operating in the state offer one. Such plans may have unfavorable terms and high premiums. So back to Rohack's claim. Health care reform legislation now under consideration in Congress would, if enacted, improve the situation for pregnant women seeking health insurance by prohibiting restrictions based on pre-existing conditions. But for now, Rohack is correct that pregnancy is considered a pre-existing condition and prevents many women from getting coverage if they seek insurance on the individual market. We find his statement True.	None	J. James Rohack	None	None	None	2009-08-18T18:26:15	2009-08-16	['None']
pomt-01144	In the U.S. agreement with the Cuban government, "no commitment was made to allowing the establishment of political parties or to even begin the semblance of a transition to a democracy."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/dec/18/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-talks-cuba-produced-no-commitment/	Sen. Marco Rubio -- a Republican born to Cuban emigres whose Florida constituency includes the nation’s largest concentration of Cuban-Americans -- has taken the lead opposing President Barack Obama’s overhaul of U.S.-Cuba relations. His main complaint: The United States isn’t getting enough out of the deal, especially when it comes to democratic reforms. On Dec. 17, 2014, Obama said the United States would be re-establishing diplomatic relations with Cuba for the first time in more than five decades, as well as easing longstanding travel and export restrictions. The move coincided with Cuba’s release of jailed American contractor Alan Gross. Rubio called the warming of relations "profoundly disappointing. It is a victory for the oppressive Cuban government, but a serious setback for the repressed Cuban people." To Rubio, the agreements between the two governments -- which had been worked out in secret over 18 months -- were one-sided, with the United States drawing the short end of the stick. Here’s more of what Rubio had to say at a press conference: "The White House has conceded everything and gained little. They gained no commitment on the part of the Cuban regime to freedom of press or freedom of speech or elections. No binding commitment was made to truly open up the Internet. No commitment was made to allowing the establishment of political parties or to even begin the semblance of a transition to a democracy. "And in exchange for all of these concessions, the only thing the Cuban government agreed to do is free 53 political prisoners who could wind up in jail tomorrow morning if they once again take up the cause of freedom and to allow the United Nations and the Red Cross to monitor conditions on the island, the same United Nations that did nothing when Cuba last year was caught helping North Korea evade United Nations sanctions." We wondered whether Rubio is right that, under the agreement, Cuba doesn’t have to "even begin the semblance of a transition to a democracy." What's in the agreement? After looking over the publicly available information, it seems like Rubio has a point. If talks between the United States and Cuba resulted in any final document, it hasn’t been released yet. Instead, we’ll rely on what the White House has made public in its comments. (Rubio’s office did not respond to an inquiry for this story.) On the subject of "human rights and civil society," a White House summary focuses mostly on what the United States promises to do in fostering those goals in Cuba, not on what the Castro regime had promised to do. The administration "will continue to implement U.S. programs aimed at promoting positive change in Cuba, and we will encourage reforms in our high level engagement with Cuban officials," the White House summary said. "Ultimately, it will be the Cuban people who drive economic and political reforms." In his remarks announcing the change in policy, Obama seemed to acknowledge that the two countries disagree on human rights and democracy. "Where we disagree, we will raise those differences directly -– as we will continue to do on issues related to democracy and human rights in Cuba," Obama said. "But I believe that we can do more to support the Cuban people and promote our values through engagement. After all, these 50 years have shown that isolation has not worked. It’s time for a new approach." This theme was reiterated during a conference call with reporters featuring unnamed "senior administration officials." They said that the United States’ emphasis on human rights won’t be decreasing, only pursued within a context of direct relations with the Cuban government. The officials said the United States would seek to leverage other nations’ efforts to promote democracy in Cuba, including at the Summit of the Americas in Panama next year. They said the difference now will be that the United States would conduct its democracy-building efforts -- which they said the Cuban government forcefully opposes -- within the context of normalized relations. Meanwhile, Raul Castro, in a televised speech from Havana, promised only "dialogue," not concrete steps, on democracy and human rights. He said Cuba recognizes "that we have profound differences fundamentally in the subject of national sovereignty, democracy, human rights and domestic policy. I reaffirm our willingness to dialogue on all these topics." Are there concrete steps? So far, we see nothing about what the Castro regime needs to do to promote democracy. Is there anything specific in what’s been announced? The answer is: A bit. During the conference call, officials said that the the Cuban government has made "sovereign decisions" to release 53 political prisoners whose cases were brought to Cuba’s attention by the U.S. government." In addition, the White House says the Cuban government said it would be taking steps to increase Internet connectivity for its citizens. The White House argues that, in conjunction with additional authorization for U.S. telecommunications companies to operate in Cuba, ordinary Cubans will be empowered by better Internet access. Finally, officials announced that Cuba would increase its engagement with the United Nations and with the International Committee of the Red Cross about monitoring conditions within Cuba. Indeed, Rubio mentioned these three steps in his press conference -- but even if these changes prove permanent (and there’s no guarantee they will) they were outweighed, in his view, by the lost opportunity to leverage bigger pro-democracy reforms, such as the creation of political parties and a loosening of the Castro family’s grip on the island’s politics. When we asked experts whether Rubio’s description is on target, they said it was. "It’s accurate," said Eric Farnsworth, who worked in the Clinton White House’s office of the special envoy for the Americas and now serves as vice president of the Council of the Americas. "Rubio is about right," agreed Brock Tessman, associate director of the Center for the Study of Global Issues at the University of Georgia. "While these initial changes, particularly the introduction of open media technology, may eventually lead to more profound political changes, nothing in yesterday's agreement commits Raul Castro to concrete steps toward democratization." Jonathan Benjamin-Alvarado, a political scientist at the University of Nebraska Omaha, concurred. He predicted that any concrete concessions on democracy and human rights would have to wait until -- or if -- Congress decides it’s ready to lift the decades-old trade embargo. "This is what Congress will argue must be dealt with for the embargo to be lifted," Benjamin-Alvarado said. He added, "I take Raul Castro’s response to mean that he too understands the nature of how normalization must unfold and what conditions will have to be addressed." Our ruling Rubio said that in the U.S.-Cuba negotiations, "no commitment was made to allowing the establishment of political parties or to even begin the semblance of a transition to a democracy." He’s largely correct. Cuba did promise to release 53 political prisoners, take steps to open up the Internet and allow greater scrutiny by international organizations. But the secret talks led to no breakthroughs in structural reform to a political system dominated for more than half a century by the Castro brothers. Rather than producing pro-democratic results now, the agreement seeks to create the conditions for results later. Rubio's statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2014-12-18T18:01:20	2014-12-17	['United_States', 'Cuba']
pomt-05667	Because of the new health care law, "17 million kids can no longer be denied for a pre-existing condition."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/16/barack-obama/barack-obama-film-says-health-care-law-aided-17-mi/	A new film from President Barack Obama's re-election campaign makes the case that his health care law has expanded coverage and stopped insurance companies from denying benefits to people because of previous illnesses. We’re checking several claims from the film, including this one, that "17 million kids can no longer be denied for a pre-existing condition." It’s true that the law prohibits excluding children with pre-existing conditions from private health insurance, effective six months following enactment. (Adults with pre-existing conditions get new protections that aren’t as strong.) We found problems with both the number of children affected by this provision and by how that number is used. The number It comes from an analysis by the Department of Health and Human Services. It used a list of serious health conditions to create two estimates of how many Americans would run into trouble with private insurers in the individual market if they ever needed to obtain insurance after a break in coverage. The first and more limited estimate counts the people who would likely be denied coverage outright if the new health care law is overturned (or was never passed). The second and more expansive estimate adds cases in which the applicant might be offered a more expensive policy or one that excludes the pre-existing condition in question. In the big picture, the study found that "as many as 82 million Americans with employer-based coverage have a pre-existing condition, ranging from life-threatening illnesses like cancer to chronic conditions like diabetes, asthma, or heart disease." Specifically looking at children, the study found that for the more limited definition -- one that would be expected to result in outright exclusion from coverage -- would affect 5 percent of minors. The broader definition, which could include policies that cover everything but the pre-existing condition or full coverage for a higher price, would affect 24 percent of children. "Translating these percentages into numbers of people, there are 4 to 17 million children under age 18 with some type of pre-existing condition," the HHS analysis said. So the film is cherry-picking the high end of that range. It’s also worth noting that the film has stripped some important context from this number. The film said that due to the new health care law, "17 million kids can no longer be denied for a pre-existing condition." That’s the higher of the two figures -- by a factor of more than four -- and one that includes cases in which the child isn’t actually denied, but in which the family has to pay higher premiums. For those situations, it’s not really accurate to say that they’ve been "denied" coverage, but rather that they are forced to pay more for coverage. How the number is used The phrasing the film uses -- "17 million kids can no longer be denied for a pre-existing condition" -- is open to interpretation. To watch the film, it’s easy to think that 17 million children have been freed from the shackles of pre-existing conditions and are now able to purchase coverage as a result of the law. But that’s not what the statistics used to back up this claim actually say. Most of those 17 million children already have insurance. The HHS study sampled the national U.S. population -- both insured and uninsured -- and looked at how many Americans in various age groups would be at risk of having a pre-existing condition that would pose barriers in the insurance market if they were currently uninsured and were seeking insurance on the individual market. For various reasons, including access to Medicaid or the State Children’s Health Insurance Program, the number of children nationally who were both (a) uninsured before the passage of the law, and (b) had a pre-existing condition that posed a barrier to their obtaining insurance is almost certainly a whole lot lower than 17 million. And it’s probably a whole lot lower than 4 million, too. We couldn’t find precise figures on this, but we can triangulate a bit. The same study says that "the number of people who both have a pre-existing condition and are uninsured ranges from 9 to 25 million -- or as much as 46 percent of the uninsured. Among non-elderly people with some type of pre-existing condition, about one in five, or 19 percent, is uninsured." Apply that percentage to the range of estimates and you get 760,000 to 3.2 million children who are uninsured due to pre-existing conditions. But even those estimates are probably too high. The likelihood of having a problematic pre-existing condition is not equal for all ages. According to the same study, children have pre-existing conditions either at one-fifth the rate of the population at large (using the first, narrower measurement) or one-third the rate of the population at large (using the second, broader measurement). If you multiply these rates by our previous estimate of uninsured children with pre-existing conditions, the numbers fall further -- to 160,000 on the low end and 1.1 million on the high end. That's a lot lower than 17 million. One additional point. The study argues -- and we wouldn’t deny -- that in the absence of the law, pre-existing conditions would be a big problem for people who "become self-employed, take a job with a company that does not offer coverage, or experience a change in life circumstance, such as divorce, retirement, or moving to a different state." But the film would have been more accurate if it had described the impact of the law as offering a backstop for people who have pre-existing conditions, whether they have no coverage or if they for any reason lose or give up their coverage in the future. Our ruling We find this claim problematic on several levels. While the law does serve as a backstop for those at risk of being denied coverage, the film cites the higher of two equally plausible estimates, cherry-picking a number that’s more than four times as high as the smaller estimate. And it glosses over a key difference: The study focused on people who could potentially be helped by the law if they found themselves uninsured in the future, not on those who actually were uninsured and were blocked from getting coverage by pre-existing conditions today. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-03-16T18:33:12	2012-03-16	['None']
pomt-13043	Says he "won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/28/donald-trump/donald-trumps-pants-fire-claim-millions-illegal-vo/	President-elect Donald Trump provoked a firestorm on social media with a series of tweets on Nov. 27 that questioned the integrity of the balloting that elected him president. In one tweet, Trump wrote, "In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com He later tweeted, "Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California - so why isn't the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem!" These tweets offer a cornucopia of assertions we’ve already debunked, including the notion that Trump won the Electoral College in a "landslide" (False), that he won the popular vote (Pants on Fire), and that 3 million votes were cast by illegal aliens (False). We found zero evidence for Trump’s charge that he "won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally," and a lot of reasons to conclude that it didn’t happen. The current status of the vote Almost three weeks after Election Day, the ballots are mostly — but not entirely — counted. The most comprehensive vote-tracking analysis is published by David Wasserman of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. As of noon on Nov. 28, according to Wasserman’s calculations, Hillary Clinton led Trump by roughly 2.24 million votes -- specifically, 64,654,483 for Clinton, 62,418,820 for Trump, and 7,192,036 for other candidates. Late ballot tabulations in some states are still trickling in -- many of them states, such as California, where Clinton fared overwhelmingly well. For this reason, Wasserman tweeted on Nov. 26 that Clinton seems to be on track to win the popular vote by 2.5 million to 2.7 million votes, or a margin of about 2 percentage points over Trump. So to erase Trump’s popular-vote deficit, there would need to be almost 3 million votes for Clinton that were cast illegally. And that assumes that all 3 million of these "illegal votes" went to Clinton and not a single one went to Trump. That’s a really big number. For a sense of scale, 3 million votes is more than were cast for any presidential candidate in 36 states plus the District of Columbia. And 3 million people is more than a quarter of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States — a group that InfoWars specifically singled out as the source of 3 million illegal votes. A lack of evidence As we’ve previously noted, conspiracy-minded websites — notably Alex Jones’ InfoWars — have posted articles claiming that 3 million votes in the presidential election were "cast by illegal aliens." We rated that False. As evidence of its claim, InfoWars’ headline referred to a report from VoteFraud.org and tweets from Gregg Phillips, whose Twitter profile says he’s the founder of VoteStand, a voter fraud reporting app. However, there is no report from VoteFraud.org, and Phillips told PolitiFact he is not affiliated with that website. Tweets by Phillips on Nov. 11 and Nov. 13 said that "we have verified more than 3 million votes cast by non-citizens" and that Phillips had "completed analysis of database of 180 million voter registrations. Number of non-citizen votes exceeds 3 million. Consulting legal team." Phillips has not responded to PolitiFact’s queries for additional information. He told us previously that he has chosen not to release more information because he is still working on analyzing the data and verifying its accuracy. Phillips would not say what the data is or where it came from, or what methodology he used. He said he would release the information publicly once he is finished. On a Nov. 28 conference call with reporters, Trump spokesman Jason Miller mentioned two pieces of evidence that Trump had also cited earlier in the campaign. One was a 2012 Pew Center on the States study whose author denies that it found any evidence of voter fraud. The other was a 2014 article posted on the Monkey Cage blog hosted by the Washington Post; it prompted multiple articles by other political scientists casting doubt on its accuracy. In any case, neither study offers analysis of the 2016 electoral returns. True the Vote, a group that has argued that election fraud is widespread, gave Trump’s comment rhetorical support but did not provide specific evidence. Backing from elected Republicans was scarce. One GOP senator, James Lankford of Oklahoma, said on CNN's New Day, "I don't know what (Trump) was talking about on that one." He added that while there may be irregularity "on the edges," he has "not seen any voter irregularity in the millions." Voter fraud uncommon Other research suggests that voter fraud is not widespread. • News21, a national investigative reporting project funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, found just 56 cases of noncitizens voting between 2000 and 2011. • A report by the liberal Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law found that most cases of noncitizens voting were accidental. "Although there are a few recorded examples in which noncitizens have apparently registered or voted, investigators have concluded that they were likely not aware that doing so was improper," reads the 2007 report. • In 2012, Florida Gov. Rick Scott’s administration started an effort trying to crack down on noncitizens voting by comparing driver's license data against voter rolls. The Florida Department of State created a list of 182,000 potential noncitizens that had voted. That number was whittled down to 2,700, then to about 200 before the purge was stopped amid criticism that the data was flawed given the number of false positives — including a Brooklyn-born World War II vet. Ultimately, only 85 people were removed from the rolls. Meanwhile, ProPublica, an investigative journalism project, tweeted that "we had 1,100 people monitoring the vote on Election Day. We saw no evidence the election was ‘rigged’ " and "no evidence that undocumented immigrants voted illegally." Experts unconvinced Experts dismissed the substance of Trump’s tweet. "This is patently false," said Costas Panagopoulos, a Fordham University political scientist. "There would need to be a massive national conspiracy and coordination effort to do this, and illegal aliens would need to be on the voter rolls in states across the country months earlier to be eligible to vote. It is also very convenient the estimated fraudulent vote is just enough to give Trump the popular vote. Not likely a coincidence." Emory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz added, "If Mr. Trump seriously believes that there was significant vote fraud in any state, he should file a formal protest and ask for an investigation. He does not — he is simply repeating baseless claims." And University of Denver political scientist Seth Masket said the claim is short on basic logic. "It’s bizarre to claim that Clinton had the ability to generate millions of illegal voters but not use them to help her win the Electoral College," Masket said. Our ruling Trump tweeted that he "won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally." Neither Trump nor his allies have presented any evidence of widespread illegal voting. In reality, studies have consistently shown that voter fraud is nowhere near common enough to call into question millions and millions of votes. Indeed, the ability to carry off such a far-reaching conspiracy — potentially involving millions of people over the course of several months and without being noticed by election administration officials, many of them in states controlled by Republicans — is ridiculously illogical. We rate Trump’s statement Pants on Fire. Editor's note, Nov. 28, 5:00 p.m.: This post has been updated to include references to Miller's conference call.

pomt-13709	"I’m not one for name calling."	pants on fire!	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/jul/28/ed-rendell/rendell-not-one-name-calling-sobs-idiots-wusses-be/	Rendell thinks Katie McGinty took things too far when she called Pat Toomey "an asshole." McGinty apologized for the comment hours after saying it, at a Communications Workers of America union event Monday. Rendell told Politico reporter Burgess Everett her remarks were "probably a little extreme." "I love Katie, but I’m not one for name calling," he said. "I think there’s too much disrespect in the business." He also said that she responded correctly in apologizing. Is Rendell truly "not one for name calling?" It’s tough to agree. We vividly remember the time he name-called the whole country. This was back in 2010, after the NFL bumped a late December Eagles home game against the Minnesota Vikings from a Sunday to a Tuesday due to weather. "We've become a nation of wusses. The Chinese are kicking our butt in everything," he told a local radio station. "If this was in China do you think the Chinese would have called off the game? People would have been marching down to the stadium, they would have walked and they would have been doing calculus on the way down." After his comments went viral, Rendell not only stuck to his guns, in 2012 he published a book on the topic: A Nation of Wusses: How America's Leaders Lost the Guts to Make Us Great. Wuss appears to be a common word in the Rendell lexicon. He called Chris Christie one in 2014 for rooting for the Cowboys. In 2012, he called then-Virginia Gov. Bob McConnell one for not voicing support for a ban on semiautomatic weapons. "I like Gov. McDonnell and think he does some good things, but he is being nothing but a coward and a wuss when he won’t confront the question," he stated on MSNBC. That same year, the Wall Street Journal and Boston Globe reported that despite condemning stimulus funding, Paul Ryan had actually requested some. By Rendell’s measure, Ryan was "a total wuss for denouncing something and then asking for money from it, and stating that it’s going to create jobs," as he told HuffPostLive. "Had Paul Ryan read my book, he would not have made [this] mistake he made on the campaign." It’s also hard to forget when, in 2011, Rendell didn’t appreciate some of "60 Minutes" correspondent Leslie Stahl’s questions. She was asking whether gambling legalization could have a poor influence on gambling addicts. Rendell reacted: "You’re not getting it. Those people would lose that money anyway. Don’t you understand?" Then... he popped off: "You guys don’t get that! You’re simpletons! You’re idiots if you don’t get that." Last year, after the Amtrak derailment in Philadelphia, Republican lawmakers in Congress backed a plan to cut Amtrak funding by $252 million. "Those SOBs, and that’s all I can call them, these SOBs didn’t even have the decency to table the vote," he told MSNBC’s Chris Hayes. And this May, he observed that many US women are "ugly." He felt, when assessing potential damage Donald Trump’s comments could have on his campaign, that one should consider the relative unattractiveness of women in the country. "For every one he’ll lose 1½ , two Republican women. Trump’s comments like ‘You can’t be a 10 if you’re flat-chested,’ that’ll come back to haunt him," he told the Washington Post. "There are probably more ugly women in America than attractive women. People take that stuff personally." Our Ruling Rendell told Everett, "I’m not one for name calling." Pennsylvanians know: Rendell can put his foot in his mouth. But he also can very purposefully read a fellow politician(s) for filth during a live broadcast. We’re not judging. We’re just saying. We rule this claim a Pants on Fire.	None	Ed Rendell	None	None	None	2016-07-28T14:30:00	2016-07-27	['None']
pomt-09069	Says U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul is "the sixth-richest person in Congress."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/jun/28/ted-ankrum/ankrum-says-mccaul-sixth-richest-member-congress/	Painting his November opponent as an out-of-touch millionaire, Democrat Ted Ankrum invoked U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul’s wealth in remarks to the Democrats with Disabilities caucus at the Texas Democratic State Convention in Corpus Christi. The Austin lawyer "is the sixth-richest person in Congress," Ankrum said Friday. We scurried to check. When we followed up with Ankrum, he immediately said he should have described McCaul as the sixth-richest member of the House — not all of Congress. How would Ankrum know? Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper, annually examines financial disclosure filings by members of Congress and ranks the 50 richest members by calculating their minimum net worths. On the disclosure filings, members don’t reveal exactly what they’re worth. Instead, they indicate assets and liabilities within broad categories such as $1 to $1,000, up to more than $50 million. Roll Call estimates each member’s net worth by calculating the lowest possible total assets and subtracting the lowest possible liabilities. According to Roll Call’s latest assessment, based on members’ 2008 submissions, McCaul was then the 11th-richest member of Congress, and the sixth-richest House member. McCaul’s estimated net worth that year: $38.08 million. The sixth-richest member that year, according to Roll Call’s research, was Rep. Jared Polis of Colorado, with an estimated net worth of $71 million. "McCaul’s assets grew by at least $14 million in 2008," Roll Call said, "a jump of nearly 60 percent from his reported minimum value the year before. McCaul holds the largest percentage increase in wealth among any member." Roll Call also reported that many lawmakers on its top-50 list had suffered steep financial losses, reporting a combined loss of more than $275 million from their combined estimated net worths in 2007. Roll Call said McCaul’s boost in wealth reflected a significant jump in some of his wife’s investments, which were valued at a minimum of $25 million. McCaul’s father-in-law is Lowry Mays, the founder of media giant Clear Channel Communications. We checked in with McCaul’s campaign, whose spokesman Mike Rosen, didn’t quibble with the ranking. Overall, 28 Democrats and 22 Republicans made the publication’s top-50 list. The most flush member of Congress that year was Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., with an estimated net worth of $167.55 million. Other Texans in the money: U.S. Rep. Kenny Marchant, R-Irving, ranked 25th with an estimated net worth of $11.89 million, Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, came in 35th at $7.14 million and Rep. Randy Neugebauer, R-Lubbock, landed 46th at $5.91 million. Summing up (ahem): Ankrum misspoke because McCaul, by the latest ranking, is the the sixth-richest member of the House, not Congress. Still, the punch line is about the same; McCaul was better off than most colleagues. We rate Ankrum’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-00245	Says a bill co-sponsored by Sen. Claire McCaskill "would give a free pass to any illegal immigrant who brings a child to the border."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/06/josh-hawley/hawley-misconstrues-mccaskills-support-keep-famili/	Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley and outside groups supporting his campaign have criticized Sen. Claire McCaskill for her views on immigration during their Senate race. A recent salvo in this subtext of their contest comes from Hawley in the form of an op-ed for FoxNews.com. "…now she (McCaskill) is sponsoring the most radical open-border bill ever introduced in Congress," Hawley wrote. "Her bill was written by California liberal Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, and it would give a free pass to any illegal immigrant who brings a child to the border." Hawley is referring to the Keep Families Together Act, which would bar family separations except if the child is at risk of trafficking and abuse by parents or guardians. Kelli Ford, the Hawley campaign’s press secretary, said that Hawley’s "free pass" comments meant that if you are an immigrant coming here illegally with a child, this bill would let you enter into the United States. With immigration becoming a wedge issue between McCaskill and Hawley, we spoke to experts and consulted the text of the bill to determine the accuracy of Hawley’s assertion. Hawley’s explanation Ford pointed to the language of the bill from Section 2(a), which, in her words, "tells agents/officers that they can’t remove a child from a parent/legal guardian within the 100-mile limit" of the United States. That’s true — with exceptions. Border officials could separate if the child is a victim of trafficking or at significant risk of it; if there's a strong likelihood that the adult is not the parent; or if the child is in danger of abuse or neglect. State courts and state or county child welfare agencies can also separate families if it's in the child's best interest. Finally, Ford pointed to an excerpt from the bill that says children can’t be removed from guardians "solely for the policy goal of deterring individuals from migrating to the United States or for the policy goal of promoting compliance with civil immigration laws." Expert consensus Hawley’s depiction of the Keeping Families Together Act is incorrect, experts said. "The bill would not grant illegal immigrants a ‘pass’ — free or otherwise — to enter or live legally or illegally in the United States," David Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute think tank wrote in an email. "It would only prohibit the separation of children from their parents who come to the border unless the child is a victim of trafficking or abuse." Bier went on to write that the bill does not forbid the removal of parents who are undocumented immigrants from the U.S., meaning it does not change existing immigration law, nor does it seek to make it easier for such parents or guardians to stay in the U.S. Leon Fresco, an immigration attorney based in Washington, D.C., put his objections to Hawley’s claim simply: "Nothing in this bill prevents the removal of a family unit in its entirety." The bill does not block families from being detained together, said Fresco, a former deputy assistant attorney general who drafted the Senate’s comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013. While Fresco understands the reasoning behind thinking it’s wrong to "prevent the government from prosecuting an adult for crossing the border illegally if they bring their child," that is not what this proposed law would do. "It only prevents the separation of the adult and the child," Fresco wrote. The bill does not put forth safeguards for immigrants without documentation; adults can still be prosecuted. Matt Barreto, UCLA professor of political science and Chicana/o studies, was adamant in his disagreement with Hawley’s conclusion about the bill: "It absolutely does not do that." "It just blocks DHS/CBP from taking children away from their parents," Barreto wrote in an email. "People still have to go through all the normal procedures for asylum, refugee or immigration." The Hawley campaign pointed out that Barreto’s firm Latino Decisions did polling work for the Hillary Clinton campaign. Our ruling Hawley said McCaskill backed a bill that "would give a free pass to any illegal immigrant who brings a child to the border." The bill in question takes no such measure. Undocumented immigrants are not afforded any new protections from prosecution under the bill; it seeks to stop the separation of immigrant children from their families or guardians. The thinking behind Hawley’s charge against McCaskill has been echoed by Republican officials throughout the country. That doesn’t make it more right. We rate the statement False. Update, Oct. 6, 11:30p.m.: The article has been updated to add context to two sources, Leon Fresco and Matt Barreto.

pomt-08918	People in the top tax bracket, "these so-called wealthy, most of them are small-business owners."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/27/stephen-hayes/so-called-wealthy-are-actually-small-business-owne/	Across-the-board tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush are set to expire at the end of the year, stoking the political debate over tax policy. President Barack Obama campaigned on the position that lower tax rates should only be extended for single people who make less than $200,000 a year, or couples who make less than $250,000. Republicans, on the other hand, want the lower tax rates to stay in place for everyone. One of the arguments Republicans use to support tax cuts for the wealthy is that most are small business owners. Conservative pundit Stephen Hayes made the case on ABC News' This Week, after U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner affirmed the Obama administration's commitment to raising taxes on high earners. "The people that we're talking about, these so-called wealthy, most of them are small-business owners," Hayes said. "So if you're talking about cutting taxes for people who can put people back to work, that's who you're talking about." It's certainly more politically palatable to urge lower taxes for mom-and-pop business owners than for Wall Street fat cats. But is it true that most of the rich are small business owners? We fact-checked similar claims during the 2008 election, so we're familiar with the sources that both sides use to argue this point. The basis for Hayes' claim comes from details gleaned from Internal Revenue Service data. The U.S. Treasury Department found in 2007 that many of the wealthiest tax filers report some type of non-wage income, such as income from a sole proprietorship, a partnership or an S corporation. (An S corporation is simply a corporation that chooses to pass corporate income, losses, deductions and credit through to their shareholders for federal tax purposes.) The Treasury Department estimated that 75 percent of tax payers in the top bracket reported this type of income. Does this mean that all those wealthy taxpayers were small business owners? Probably not. This kind of income could be reported from anyone who earned money from a source other than a regular job, such as consulting or public speaking. It could also be reported by those who make most of their income from partnerships, such as law firms and medical practices. And it could include investors who have little involvement in the day-to-day operations of a company. It's impossible to know how many of these high earners are what most people think of as small business owners. One indication, however, might be if these wealthy taxpayers reported that most of their income was from this business-type income. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center analyzed IRS data in March 2009, looking to see how many wealthy tax filers could say that half of their income or more came from business income. The center found that, among the wealthiest filers -- the top 1 percent -- only 25 percent earned more than half their income from business-type income. The percentages for non-wage income were even smaller among taxpayers earning less. (Editor's note: After we initially published this item, the Tax Policy Center released a new analysis looking at business income by tax bracket. They found that in the top bracket, only 32.5 percent earned more than half their income that way.) Hayes defended his statement in an e-mail to PolitiFact. While he conceded that not every tax filer who reports business income is a small business owner, he said he found the 50 percent cut-off for defining owners arbitrary. "I can see not counting as a 'small business owner' someone who makes $500,000 in from an employer and $2,000 in small business income. And if we included all of those people the number would be comfortably above 'most' among the top earners. So reasonable people can disagree about where to draw that line. But it seems odd that we would not count as a 'small business owner' someone who owns a small business that generates 49 percent of her overall income," he said. There's one final point we want to clarify here for our readers, because we've been asked about this before: If you are a small business owner yourself, you would have to be a whiz running a very profitable small business to get hit with a tax increase under the plan Obama supports. You would have to report total income of more than $200,000 (or $250,000 for couples) after all your business expenses were deducted. You may remember this being a key point during the Joe the Plumber debate during the 2008 campaign when Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher said to then candidate Obama, "I'm getting ready to buy a company that makes 250 to 280 thousand dollars a year. Your new tax plan's going to tax me more, isn't it?" Back then, the Tax Policy Center analyzed all taxpayers, of any income level, who report these types of business income. They found only about 2 percent of them would see tax increases if the government increased the rates on the top earners. So the vast majority of possible small business owners would not see a tax increase if the Bush tax cuts expire for those in the top incomes. In conclusion, do many wealthy tax payers report types of business income that might be from owning a small business? Sure. But it's impossible to tell how many meet the definition of what most of us think of when we think of small business owners. Other data indicate that among all tax payers who might be small business owners, most would not see taxes go up if the Bush tax cuts for the highest earners are allowed to expire. Hayes said that "these so-called wealthy, most of them are small-business owners." We rate that statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Stephen Hayes	None	None	None	2010-07-27T16:23:31	2010-07-25	['None']
pomt-11360	"Breaking! Terrorist attacks Trumps at Mar A Lago."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/03/trump-talks/misleading-headline-says-terrorist-attack-trump-pr/	An alarmist headline on Facebook went too far in describing what happened in South Florida while President Donald Trump and his family celebrated Easter weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate. "Breaking! Terrorist attacks Trumps at Mar A Lago -- police on scene," said an April 2 headline on The Trump Talks, a pro-Trump website. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found that what actually happened at a Trump property in Palm Beach County was an act of vandalism, not terrorism. The story described those who oppose Trump as "turning to threats of physical violence." "Now, over this holiday weekend, President Trump and his family had an urgent situation unfold that had the police rushing to the scene, and has everyone wondering when the violence will end?" the story said. But after several paragraphs, what the story then described wasn’t actually violence -- and it wasn’t at Mar-a-Lago but at the nearby Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. The Trump Talks cites a Local 10 TV news report about what actually happened: Red paint was splattered on the Trump International Golf Club sign on the night of March 31. Trump had spent several hours at the golf course earlier in the day. Multiple news reports said that the U.S. Secret Service and the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office were investigating. News accounts described the incident as vandalism. We didn’t get much information about the incident from either entity. A Secret Service spokesman referred PolitiFact to the sheriff’s office, and a spokeswoman for the sheriff’s office referred PolitiFact to the Secret Service because it is the lead investigative agency. A headline said that "terrorist attacks Trumps at Mar A Lago" creating a false impression that terrorism occurred targeting Trump and his family. What actually happened involved was a less nefarious case of red-hued vandalism -- not terrorism. We rate this claim False.

pomt-09539	"Florida still averages more students in its classrooms than any other state in the Southeast."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/feb/06/franklin-sands/florida-democrat-says-state-last-among-southeast-s/	After spending almost $16 billion to implement Florida's voter-approved plan to reduce class sizes, Gov. Charlie Crist and the Republican Legislature are now talking about reining it in. But a leading Democrat says the idea would leave the state not much else than a big bill to show for the investment. "I am hesitant of the governor's call for changing the class-size amendment in the state Constitution," House Democratic Leader Franklin Sands of Weston said in a press release on Jan. 29, 2010. "I seriously doubt that Floridians will want to undo what they approved in 2002. I strongly support giving school districts the flexibility they need to deal with small increases in the student-teacher ratios. But it is important to remember that Florida still averages more students in its classrooms than any other state in the Southeast." We wondered if Sands' claim, that Florida averages more students per classrooms than other states in the Southeast, is right. First, some background. In November 2002, Florida voters passed a constitutional amendment that sets limits for how many students are allowed per class starting in the 2010-11 school year. The limits are subdivided by grades K-3, 4-8 and 9-12: no more than 18 students for grades K-3, no more than 22 students for grades 4-8 and no more than 25 students for grades 9-12. In 2003, the state started to slowly implement the changes. First, classroom reductions were measured at the school district average, then at the school average. In the fall, districts are scheduled to meet the new limits in every classroom. But Crist and some prominent state legislators have suggested freezing the class-size reduction program at the school average rather than investing more money. (The state Department of Education says reducing class sizes further would cost an additional $3.2 billion.) A recent state report suggests almost 235,000 classrooms in 2,769 schools across Florida would fall short if the amendment were fully implemented in the fall. In contrast, only a small percentage of schools have not met the requirements of a schoolwide average. Districts face possible financial penalties in the millions if they fall short. Back to Sands' claim. His office pointed us to the National Center for Education Statistics, part of the U.S. Department of Education, which is considered a primary source on education statistics and research. States submit annual data to NCES, which then calculates enrollment and teacher statistics. The most recent data available is from the 2007-08 school year, said Patrick Keaton, a researcher with the group. Data from the 2008-09 school year is due out this spring, he said. Using teacher and enrollment data, NCES calculates a pupil/teacher ratio. Florida, in 2007-2008, had 15.8 students for every classroom teacher, the NCES reported. That is more than Alabama (14.8), Arkansas (14.1), Georgia (14.1), Kentucky (15.3), Louisiana (14), Mississippi (14.7), North Carolina (14), South Carolina (15), and Tennessee (14.9), according to the NCES. Now Sands said in the "Southeast" -- which isn't a region defined by the U.S. government and has subjective boundaries. If, for instance, Virginia fits your definition of Southeast, it had a higher pupil/teacher ratio in 2007-08 (17.1) than Florida (15.8), the NCES found. If you consider Texas or West Virginia in the Southeast, each has a pupil/teacher ratio lower than Florida's. Among the 50 states, Florida was tied for 35th with respect to pupil/teacher ratio in 2007-08, according to the NCES. Another important distinction: Sands said Florida "averages" more students in its classrooms when compared to other states. But average class size and pupil/teacher ratios are not equivalent, said Alan Richard, with the Southern Regional Education Board, a nonpartisan group that helps 16 member states create education policy. Class size measures the number of students in a class, most often core math, science and English classes -- while pupil/teacher ratios take the number of students in all types of classes and divide by the number of teachers. Put another way, if 30 high school juniors were in an English class and 10 high school juniors were in an art class, the calculation for class size would likely be 30 but the calculation for pupil/teacher ratio would be 20. Not all states calculate average class size. (At least Tennessee and Kentucky don't, education officials in those states confirmed.) Back to what Sands said: His broader point -- that Florida has more students in its classrooms than other states -- is largely true, as measured by pupil/teacher ratios. But Sands said "Florida still averages more students in its classrooms than any other state in the Southeast," and there are at least three caveats to his statement: Use of the word "still" implies currently, but Sands is relying on 2-year-old data to make his claim. (We tried to calculate 2008-09 pupil/teacher ratios ourselves using state enrollment and teacher data. While Florida's position didn't change among the states we were able to collect information from, we can't say unequivocally that Florida ranks last.) Sands is slightly misrepresenting the NCES calculation. Though speaking about average class sizes, he refers to a report measuring pupil-to-teacher ratios, which can be different. And then there's a question on what states are included in the Southeast. If Virginia is included, Florida ranks second. In our minds, that's enough asterisks to knock Sands' statement to Half True.

pomt-11266	Says Mitt Romney is using "a million of his presidential campaign dollars to finance his Utah Senate race."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/27/jenny-wilson/yes-1-million-mitt-romneys-failed-white-house-bid-/	A Democratic candidate for Utah’s U.S. Senate seat claimed Republican opponent Mitt Romney is using $1 million of leftover donations to his unsuccessful presidential run to finance his Senate bid. "The former Governor of Massachusetts is taking yet another short cut to the Utah Senate Seat," Nickie Titus, campaign manager for Democrat Jenny Wilson, said in a press release. "Mitt certainly does things his way — moves to Utah from California (and) uses a million of his presidential campaign dollars to finance his Utah senate race." It turns out Wilson’s campaign is right: Romney is using $1 million from his failed presidential bid to fuel his Senate campaign. Experts told us this is common in politics, though the practice has come under criticism. Campaign fund-shifting Romney’s failure to reach the White House in 2008 and 2012 is not without a silver lining. It elevated Romney’s public stature, gave him staying power in Republican politics and left him with a substantial — and flexible — bankroll. Campaign finance rules have long allowed a candidate to hold on to surplus campaign funds indefinitely, said Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist at the group Public Citizen, a progressive consumer rights advocacy group. Under the Federal Election Campaign Act and Federal Election Commission rules, candidates can also make unlimited transfers of funds between campaigns, Holman said. "It happens all the time," said Michael J. Malbin, the executive director of the Campaign Finance Institute, a campaign finance policy think tank. "House members take their bankrolls to run for the Senate, senators to run for president. As long as the money was raised for a federal office under federal contribution limits, it's okay." Holman argued just because the practice is widespread doesn’t mean it’s fair. He said the policy can create an uneven playing field and permits candidates to use funds in a way that’s contrary to donors’ intentions. "A donor may have supported Romney’s presidential campaign against the Democratic nominee, but not support Romney’s new campaign for Senate in the primary or general election," Holman said. "Yet, under the law, Romney has the authority to use those donors’ funds without getting their approval." Romney followed suit At the beginning of 2018, Romney for President, Inc., the nonprofit organization that supported Romney’s failed 2012 presidential bid, had roughly $1.3 million cash on hand. On Feb. 5, the organization transferred $1 million to Romney for Utah, Inc., according to an FEC filing. To the chagrin of Romney’s opponents, the transfer from Romney’s presidential campaign to his Senate run comprises donations made mostly by non-Utah residents, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. "The $1 million is indicative of what we’re seeing from Mitt Romney. He’s bringing in national money to make this a national-profile race," Wilson told the Tribune. "I’m a Utahn running for Utahns." The April 15, 2018, FEC filing, which covered the first three months of the year, shows the organization also made smaller disbursements for consulting work, email services and bank fees. At the end of the reporting period, Romney for President, Inc., had $222,755 cash on hand. Our ruling Wilson’s campaign said Romney is using "a million of his presidential campaign dollars to finance his Utah senate race." The nonprofit organization that collected money for Romney’s 2012 campaign transferred $1 million to Romney’s bid for Utah’s Senate seat. We rate this True.

pomt-11021	"More than 66% of ALL births in California are to illegals on Medi-Cal."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/05/viral-image/viral-image-overstates-births-undocumented-mothers/	A viral image on social media -- one that’s critical of illegal immigration -- has been circulating for years. The list of claims first circulated in the form of a chain email in 2006, according to Snopes.com. Six years later, we checked several of the claims ourselves. With immigration in the headlines today, these claims are popular again. In this article, we’ll fact-check No. 4: "More than 66% of ALL births in California are to illegals on Medi-Cal." Medi-Cal is the name of California’s Medicaid program, which covers low-income residents of the state. Undocumented immigrants may be eligible for health plan options through Medi-Cal, although the benefits may be limited. The most recent complete data we found was from 2011. That year, the state had 502,120 total births. According to Medi-Cal, 50.4 percent of the state’s births that year were paid for by Medi-Cal. That works out to 253,068 total births on Medi-Cal. Medi-Cal also reported that 29 percent of Medi-Cal mothers in 2011 were undocumented. So that year, 73,390 undocumented mothers gave birth on Medi-Cal. As a percentage of all births in the state, that works out to about 15 percent -- not 66 percent, as the meme says. After we initially published this article, a spokeswoman for California's Department of Health Care Services provided statistics for 2012 and 2013. As it turns out, the percentage declined in those years -- to 13.4 percent in 2012 and 12.6 percent in 2013. In its previous review of these claims, Snopes evaluated an earlier version of the assertion that was worded, "Over 2/3’s of all births in Los Angeles County are to illegal alien Mexicans on Medi-Cal whose births were paid for by taxpayers." So we looked at the data for Los Angeles in 2013, the most recent year we could find on the California Department of Public Health website. That doesn’t support the earlier version of the claim either. That year, about 57 percent of births to residents of Los Angeles were Hispanic. But that refers to all Hispanic births -- not just those to undocumented immigrants, who accounted for only a fraction of the total Hispanic population. Our ruling The meme says, "More than 66% of ALL births in California are to illegals on Medi-Cal." That’s wrong. Between 2011 and 2013, the most recent years available, between 12 percent and 15 percent of all births statewide were to undocumented immigrants using Medicaid, not 66 percent. We rate the statement False. UPDATE, July 5, 7:00 p.m.: This article has been updated with the most recent figures provided by California's Department of Health Care Services.

pomt-05345	Florida has "1,200 golf courses. I think 58 million rounds played a year in Florida. We’ve got 44 percent of all travel golf in the country here. 5 million people come here just for golf."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/may/11/rick-scott/rick-scott-talks-floridas-golfing-creds-ahead-play/	Gov. Rick Scott considers himself Florida’s promoter-in-chief. So it makes sense that he would use a TV interview on the opening day of the Players Championship at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach to show off just how important golf is to Florida. "Golf is big for the state," Scott told Action News Jacksonville on May 10, 2012. "1,200 golf courses. I think it’s 58 million rounds of golf played a year in Florida. … We’ve got 44 percent of all the travel golf in the country here. 5 million people come to Florida just for golf. It’s big business. It creates a lot of jobs." Look, we’re not all politics all the time. We like to unwind and embrace our Florida side, too. We decided some golf-related research was in order. There’s no doubt the sport is huge for Florida. Experts we consulted agree it’s the No. 1 destination for golf in the world. Scott received this information from a 2004 National Golf Foundation report, spokesman Lane Wright said. We tried to get a copy but couldn’t locate one. Scott is mostly on the mark with his statements, but we found some rough patches that we’ll explain one by one. 1,200 golf courses: Scott is close. Play Florida, the state’s golf marketing program, puts the number of facilities a little lower, at 1,056. Did you catch how we used "facilities" instead of "courses"? That’s because one facility may have multiple courses. Take the Innisbrook Golf Resort in Palm Harbor, which has four courses but counts as one facility. For that reason, the real number of courses is probably higher than 1,200, but "that’s the number we use," said Gary Jones, who manages Play Florida. 58 million rounds played a year: The number of rounds played each year is the barometer of the popularity of golf, said Tom Stine, co-founder of Golf Datatech, which conducts market research for the industry. It seems the governor caught wind of some expired talking points. The number of rounds was 59 million in 2000, according to a University of Florida study. In 2011, the number of rounds was 41 million, Stine said. That’s a slight uptick from 2010, but it still trails the annual number of rounds before the recession set in, which is probably where Scott is drawing his number, he said. Round counts are up for 2012 in Florida and the country, he said. The reason is lots of sunny weather nationwide -- good news for golf lovers but bad for people who prefer skis. Florida gets 44 percent of all travel golf in the country: This is the hardest one to track down. Stine said he doesn’t know what Scott means here, and that he’s skeptical all the golf in California, the Carolinas, Georgia, Arizona, Texas, and Michigan (in the summer) comprises just 56 percent of "travel golf." "It’s one of those numbers if you don’t attach the methodology for it, how in the heck do you know what that means?" Stine said. Jones also couldn’t be sure. "I can tell you that it’s over 40 percent," he said, citing a university study he could not find by our deadline. If we get more information on this point, we'll update our report. 5 million people come here just for golf: Scott is close here but misses a distinction between the two types of out-of-state golfers, Jones said. On one hand, there are visitors who come to Florida just to play golf. There are about 1.5 million of these people, Jones said. They play an average of 5.2 rounds. Then there are "amenity golfers" who come to Florida for reasons other than playing golf but fit it in anyway. Think of fathers making a break for it on an Orlando family vacation. Jones estimates there are 3.6 million of these golfers, which play an average of 1.2 rounds. Combining these out-of-state golfers (1.5 million + 3.6 million) amounts to 5.1 million people. A chunk of these people, though, came to Florida for other reasons, which isn’t exactly what Scott said. Our ruling Golf is a big deal for the Sunshine State -- and now we know that more rays equal more rounds. Still, Scott needs to finesse his points before getting our hole-in-one rating.

pomt-06255	Says Mitt Romney flip-flopped on a taxpayer protection pledge.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/29/democratic-national-committee/dnc-ad-says-mitt-romney-flip-flopped-taxpayer-pled/	On Nov. 28, 2011, the Democratic National Committee released two videos designed to paint Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney as a serial flip-flopper. The shorter, 30-second version gives a taste of the attack, specifically citing abortion and health care, and directs viewers to a website with a four-minute version that offers alleged flip-flops on a variety of other issues. For this item, we’ll check one of the claims from the four-minute version -- specifically, whether Romney has changed his position on signing a taxpayer protection pledge. We're looking at other aspects of the ad in separate items. Here’s the relevant portion from the DNC ad: Screen text: Will not sign pledge Audio of Candy Crowley: "Republican Mitt Romney says he will not sign a no-new-taxes pledge." Screen text: Then he did Audio from Romney radio ad: "I’m proud to be the only major candidate for president to sign the tax pledge." The first clip refers to an announcement during Romney’s 2002 gubernatorial campaign that he would not sign a pledge circulated by Citizens for Limited Taxation, a Massachusetts-based anti-tax group. Here’s how the Boston Globe covered the news: "In a break with Acting Governor Jane Swift and her GOP predecessors, Republican gubernatorial candidate Mitt Romney is refusing to rule out tax increases and said yesterday he will not sign a ‘no new taxes’ pledge," the newspaper wrote. "Romney said that while he opposes all tax increases in principle, he will not make such a pledge in writing." The article went on to quote Romney saying, "I am not in favor of increasing taxes. … At this stage, I am inclined to make that position as clear as I can but not to enter into a written pledge of some kind, and that's true on this and other issues." The Globe cited another comment by Romney that had been reported by the Union-News of Springfield, Mass. "I'm against tax increases," Romney told attendees of Western Massachusetts GOP meeting, according to the Union-News. "But I'm not intending to, at this stage, sign a document which would prevent me from being able to look specifically at the revenue needs of the Commonwealth." Barbara Anderson, an official with Citizens for Limited Taxation, was unhappy with Romney's refusal to sign, which came after he’d met with her for half an hour. "He's thinking like an independent businessman who doesn't sign pledges," she suggested to the Globe. Meanwhile, the Boston Herald quoted then Romney deputy campaign manager Eric Fehrnstrom saying, "Mitt Romney doesn't have to sign a piece of paper to have a position on an issue. He's pledged to oppose any tax increase, he doesn't support them, his position on taxes is clear." In an interview with the Globe, Fehrnstrom was even more dismissive, calling the pledge "government by gimmickry," the newspaper reported. Put it all together and you have a candidate who didn’t just decide against signing a pledge but who cast doubt on the propriety of such pledges in general. Now we’ll fast-forward a few years, when Romney, having finished a term as governor of Massachusetts, was running for president. On Dec. 31, 2006, Romney became the first major candidate for the 2008 election to sign a taxpayer protection pledge offered by Americans for Tax Reform, the anti-tax group headed by Grover Norquist. "In signing the pledge, Gov. Romney firmly commits himself in writing to fiscal discipline and economic common sense," Norquist said in a news release. "Mitt Romney has told taxpayers in no uncertain terms that he plans to look out for their interests." Romney hardly signed the Norquist pledge covertly. On Jan. 4, 2007, he issued a press release touting his action, and on Oct. 5, 2007, he released a radio ad spotlighting it. That’s where the DNC got the clip used in its ad. "For years, conservative candidates for president signed their name on the dotted line pledging to oppose tax increases," Romney said in the ad. "I'm Mitt Romney. I'm proud to be the only major candidate for president to sign the tax pledge. The others have not. I signed the tax pledge because I want everyone to know where I stand. We've got to get taxes down and grow our economy. I believe it's not fair that you have to pay taxes when you earn your money, when you save your money and when you die. That's why I'll kill the death tax once and for all and roll back tax rates across the board. And savings? When I'm president, for every middle class American, the new tax rate on your interest, dividends, and capital gains will be absolutely zero. I stood firm to roll back taxes as governor. I'll roll back taxes as president." In this case, then, Romney not only signed a written pledge but actively broadcast it to the electorate. It’s worth noting that the two pledges are not exactly the same. One addressed the state context and one the federal context.
