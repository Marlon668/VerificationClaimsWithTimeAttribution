pomt-05820	Says Texas legislators in 2011 increased state spending on education.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2012/feb/20/myra-crownover/myra-crownover-says-2011-legislature-increased-sta/	In a letter to constituents, state Rep. Myra Crownover strikes a familiar Republican chord by suggesting the 2011 Legislature dealt with tough times without shorting Texas public schools. Crownover’s message, which a reader pointed out to us on her campaign website in January 2012, says: "Most importantly, we balanced the state's budget with the first overall decrease in state spending in 50 years. We also were able to increase state spending on Education by $1.6 Billion even in the face of the worst recession in decades." We wondered if Crownover, R-Denton, was right about state education aid going up while the Republican-majority Legislature balanced the 2012-13 budget without a tax increase. That’s proved a common refrain from some Republicans including Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, who presides over the Senate. Crownover’s chief of staff, Kevin Cruser, provided a statement from Crownover pointing out that lawmakers last year wrote the budget after learning the state would reap $27 billion less in tax revenue over the two years than it would need to maintain "current services" spending, which takes into account the impact of growing demands in major funding areas including education, health and human services and employee benefits, according to the December 2011 "Fiscal Size-up" report by the nonpartisan Legislative Budget Board. Crownover’s statement further says schools were asked to tighten their belts and that federal funding available for the education part of the budget decreased significantly. "The Legislature did the best it could to lessen the impact of the recession and the decreased federal funding for public schools," her statement says, which the note says lawmakers could not cover. "In House Bill 1 (the budget act), General Revenue appropriations to the Foundation School Program increased by $1.6 billion over the previous biennium. General Revenue," Crownover notes, "is the term for state revenue that the Legislature has direct control over, and the Foundation School Program represents the most direct source of state revenue to our public schools." By law, the foundation program’s purpose is to guarantee that each school district has adequate resources to provide each student a basic instructional program and facilities. Also, each district is guaranteed access to substantially equalized financing for additional needs. Crownover’s statement also says the Legislature could not fund costs associated with rapid projected growth in the student population. After mentioning the $1.6 billion increase a second time, her statement says legislators did their best to prioritize schoolchildren. Clear sailing, then? Not for long. News accounts of legislative deliberations and budget board figures clarify that Crownover’s slightly-off recap of additional state revenue to the foundation program -- the bump proved to be $1.5 billion -- overlooks other spending decisions adding up to more than $5 billion in state-driven education budget reductions. In a way, this claim is a reminder that touting only one part of a budget can be deceptive. Let’s cover what legislators did and said, starting with news reports. Lawmakers tied up loose ends in the 2012-13 budget in a June 2011 special session. Key to Crownover’s claim: Members voted largely along party lines to approve a $2 billion a year reduction in state aid to schools based on existing funding formulas. According to a June 19, 2011, Austin American-Statesman news article, such aid, triggered by expected changes in enrollment, demographics and local property values, had formed the baseline for state education funding for 60 years. In the June session, the Republican heads of respective House and Senate education panels each acknowledged the June action as a reduction to districts though also saying the cuts could have been worse. As the Senate acted, according to a June 4, 2011, news article in the San Antonio Express-News, Sen. Florence Shapiro of Plano said: "Nobody wants cuts. But we have to have them." And as the House followed suit, a June 11, 2011, news article in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram quoted Rep. Rob Eissler of The Woodlands saying the overall net decrease to districts would average 4 to 5 percent, which he called "not that big a cut." Legislative Budget Board analyses of the budget reveal other ways that lawmakers reduced education aid. Board staffers summarized the yet-to-be finalized budget in May 2011 by saying the foundation program’s total funding, counting federal aid, would be reduced by $1.8 billion, a figure later adjusted to $1.9 billion based on actions in the June special session, according to the 2011 "Fiscal Size-up" report. This occurred, in part, due to federal aid to the foundation program dropping $2.8 billion, according to the May 2011 budget summary. In contrast, lawmakers in 2009 had the luxury of applying $3.3 billion in one-time federal stimulus aid to the public education part of the state budget, helping to cover a projected shortfall in state revenue. Congress did not send fresh stimulus money to the states in 2011. Summing up foundation program funding challenges, the 2011 "Fiscal Size-up" report says the 2011 Legislature was faced both with making up for the loss of the federal stimulus dollars that went to education in the previous budget plus $2.2 billion in costs to school districts to accommodate annual enrollment growth of 78,000 students through the 2012-13 school year. In addition, the report says, legislators had to address an estimated $2.3 billion needed to balance out past under-payments to districts for various reasons. And how did lawmakers confront those demands? They put $1.5 billion more in state revenue into the foundation program, as Crownover notes. Otherwise, the report shows, the Legislature did not cover costs of the projected enrollment increases and postponed a regular distribution of state aid to schools for 2012-13 into fiscal 2014, likely meaning the budget to be written by the 2013 Legislature. In addition, the May board summary shows that schools took another hit due to $1.4 billion in legislated reductions in funding for programs outside the foundation program. That 53 percent reduction, the summary says, diminished teacher incentive pay and dropout prevention funding and zeroed out grants to the pre-Kindergarten Early Start program. In a telephone interview, board staff spokesman John Barton told us lawmakers trimmed the reduction to $1.3 billion in their June special session. Our ruling Crownover’s statement focuses on one stream of public school funding. But other legislative decisions resulted in funding reductions to Texas schools more than twice as great as her touted increase. Overall funding to the foundation program went down. So, lawmakers ultimately cut public school aid, with key leaders even acknowledging so as those decisions were sealed. To tell constituents otherwise is not only inaccurate, it’s misleading and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!	None	Myra Crownover	None	None	None	2012-02-20T06:00:00	2012-01-30	['None']

pomt-10228	"My opponent promises to bring back old jobs by wishing away the global economy."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/04/john-mccain/obama-talks-often-about-the-global-economy-&mdash-/	In his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minn., Sen. John McCain alleged that Sen. Barack Obama's plan to create jobs amounted to "wishing away the global economy." The accusation came as McCain was talking about how he would approach today's troubled economy. "I know some of you have been left behind in the changing economy and it often seems your government hasn't even noticed," McCain said in the Sept. 4, 2008 speech. "Government assistance for unemployed workers was designed for the economy of the 1950s. That's going to change on my watch. My opponent promises to bring back old jobs by wishing away the global economy. We're going to help workers who've lost a job that won't come back, find a new one that won't go away." So where's the evidence that Obama wishes away the global economy? "He opposes free trade deals, threatens to unilaterally renegotiate NAFTA, playing on peoples' fear of free trade — wishing away the global economy," McCain spokesman Brian Rogers told us in an email exchange. "It's pretty straightforward." But it's not actually that straightforward. There's heaps of evidence out there against the charge. Obama regularly speaks not about doing away with the global economy, but competing more effectively in it. In fact, Obama did so in his own acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Denver: "Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy." Here's Obama on August 1, 2008, in St. Petersburg, Fla.: "I refuse to accept that we cannot meet the challenges of our global economy." And later in that same speech: "We can provide every child with a quality education so they have the skills to succeed in our global economy." And on July 31, 2008 in Iowa: "And we'll help American manufacturers — particularly in the auto industry — convert to green technology, and help workers learn the skills they need to stay ahead in the global economy." And on June 16, 2008 in Michigan: "Almost a decade into this century, we still have no real strategy to compete in a global economy." And on and on and on. That doesn't sound to us like someone intent on wishing away the global economy. You may disagree with how Obama would approach the challenges of the global economy, but it's hard to argue that he's pretending it doesn't exist. It's true, as Rogers alluded to, that Obama's rhetoric on free trade is often less enthusiastic than McCain's. He has criticized aspects of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and frequently courted voters who feel left out of the global economy. For example, here's Obama speaking about trade policy in Berlin, Germany on July 24, 2008: "Trade has been a cornerstone of our growth and global development. But we will not be able to sustain this growth if it favors the few, and not the many. Together, we must forge trade that truly rewards the work that creates wealth, with meaningful protections for our people and our planet. This is the moment for trade that is free and fair for all." So yes, Obama is not the most die-hard free trader there ever was. But that's a far cry from promising to "bring back old jobs by wishing away the global economy." He promises quite the opposite — to make the country more competitive in the global economy — and does it quite frequently. We find McCain's charge to be False.

pomt-15309	"Four times, I said, he (John McCain) is a hero, but you know ... people choose selective pieces."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/19/donald-trump/trump-i-called-mccain-hero-four-times/	Donald Trump is facing intense bipartisan backlash after saying Vietnam War prisoner of war Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is "not a war hero," but an indignant Trump won’t apologize. Trump defended his latest provocation on ABC’s This Week, adding that McCain "has done nothing to help veterans" and suggesting the senator should actually apologize to him for insulting Trump supporters. When pressed by host Martha Raddatz, Trump complained that his critics are taking his comments out of context. "Four times, I said he is a hero," he said on July 19, citing a fact-check by journalist Sharyl Attkisson. "But you know … people choose little selective pieces. If you read what I say or watch what I say, which is even better, you’ll say that there was nothing wrong." We took Trump’s advice and put his statement in context. The backstory The McCain-Trump war of words started in a New Yorker article published July 16. Ryan Lizza asked McCain about Trump and his anti-immigration rally held last weekend in McCain’s home state. McCain, as the article notes, led efforts to push through comprehensive immigration reform and "has been at war with the far right in Arizona for years." "This performance with our friend out in Phoenix is very hurtful to me," McCain told Lizza, "Because what he did was he fired up the crazies." Trump couldn’t take this lying down and retaliated on Twitter: (For the record, McCain graduated 894th out of a class of 899.) When Trump attended a rally in Ames, Iowa, on July 18, Republican pollster Frank Luntz asked him if calling McCain "a dummy" was appropriate. Trump recounted his beef with McCain before questioning his status as war hero in a back and forth with Luntz. Here’s a transcript of their conversation: Trump: "(McCain) insulted me and he insulted everybody in that room. And I said somebody should run against John McCain, who has been, in my opinion, not so hot. And I supported him for president. I raised $1 million for him. That’s a lot of money. I supported him, he lost, he let us down. But he lost and I never liked him much after that 'cause I don’t like losers. But, but — Frank, Frank, let me get to it. Luntz: "He’s a war hero. He’s a war hero …" Trump: "He’s not a war hero ..." Luntz: "He’s war hero." Trump: "He is a war hero ..." Luntz: "Five and half years in a Vietnamese prison camp …" Trump: "He’s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured. So he’s a war hero …" Luntz: "Do you agree with that?" Trump: "He’s a war hero, because he was captured, okay? I believe, perhaps, he’s a war hero. But right now he said some very bad things about a lot of people. So what I said is John McCain, I disagree with him that these people aren’t crazy." Trump literally said McCain "is a war hero" five times, but always with strings attached. Twice, he was interrupted by Luntz before he could finish his sentence. Once, the statement was preceded by "I believe, perhaps." And the last two times, Trump added "because he was captured." He also, of course, started all this by saying McCain is "not a war hero." Experts told us these caveats change the meaning of the sentence entirely. " ‘He’s a war hero because he was captured’ implies that anybody who is captured is called a war hero, but there’s really nothing special about them," said Kathleen Kendall, who studies political campaign communication at the University of Maryland. McCain, whose war record has been the subject of false attacks before, was taken prisoner by the Vietcong when his plane was shot down in 1967. For five and a half years, he was tortured and held in solitary confinement amid attempts by the North Vietnamese to obtain information and false confessions, according to the Navy. As the son of an admiral, McCain was offered an early release but refused until POWs who had been at the camp for longer than him were let go. We’re not remarking on whether captivity is a marker of heroism, but Trump likely wasn’t either, says rhetoric scholar Paul Achter of the University of Richmond. "(Trump) appears to have thought it would be a funny aside to the question he was answering," he said. In short, Trump’s self-defense is flimsy at best. As for his accusation of critics cherry-picking his comments, experts say the pot is calling the kettle black. "He’s taking his own words out of context. That’s the offense he’s charging the media with," Kendall said. We reached out to the Trump campaign for a response but didn’t hear back. Our ruling Trump said, "Four times, I said (McCain) is a hero but you know … people choose selective pieces." Trump literally said McCain is a hero five times, but never without caveats. Once, he added "perhaps, I believe" before conceding the point. Twice, he was interrupted. And the last two times, Trump said, "He is a war hero because he was captured." In other words, Trump also chose "selective pieces" and misquoted himself. We rate his claim Mostly False.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2015-07-19T16:55:38	2015-07-19	['None']

pomt-06782	Says a Senate resolution would restore $140 in monthly general assistance payments and prevent people from committing crime.	pants on fire!	/new-jersey/statements/2011/aug/18/sandra-cunningham/sen-sandra-cunningham-claims-new-jersey-residents-/	During a July 11 debate about overriding a veto handed down by Gov. Chris Christie, state Sen. Sandra Cunningham made an impassioned speech about the consequences of eliminating monthly general assistance payments to New Jersey residents in need. The Hudson County Democrat was pushing to restore the $19.5 million that Christie cut from the state budget for the general assistance program. A part of the state’s welfare reform program, the general assistance program serves single persons and married couples without children. Cunningham, one of the sponsors of a resolution for that funding, strongly implied that the state budget for fiscal year 2012 cut the $140 monthly payments and that her resolution would restore that amount. She argued that taking away that money would lead individuals to turn to crime. The problem is that those monthly payments were no longer in jeopardy. PolitiFact New Jersey found that Cunningham was wrong to suggest the monthly payments were going down. In fact, the final state budget maintains general assistance payments at their previous levels. First, let’s look at how Cunningham made her case. "I know when you look at it, you say, ‘It’s $140 per month. What good does it do?’ A hundred-forty dollars per month, if you don’t have a job, if you are trying to keep a roof over your head and food in your stomach, is a great deal of money," Cunningham told her colleagues. "It’s absolutely necessary. "If we don’t help these people, these people will find a way to help themselves," Cunningham continued. "When we talk about urban area, and when we talk about impoverished people, we talk a lot about crime. Well, crime and poverty go together." Cunningham went on, "And in this particular case, if these people cannot find, cannot have something to eat, they will take to the streets and they will commit a crime. They will do that." Before concluding her speech, Cunningham pleaded with her fellow senators: "Please think about how some of our people really need it and how some of our people in this state are forced to live. Please vote for this resolution." The resolution to provide that funding failed in a 24-15 vote. Now, let’s explain the general assistance payments. In fiscal year 2011, the general assistance program provided monthly benefits of $140 and $210 for recipients deemed "employable" and "unemployable," respectively. The fiscal year 2012 budget proposed by Gov. Chris Christie included language to cut monthly benefits by $15. But the Legislature threw out that language when it approved the budget and Christie could not add it back in. David Rosen, legislative budget and finance officer for the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, confirmed that removing that language from the governor’s proposed budget maintained the monthly benefit levels and the governor could not restore that language. Nicole Brossoie, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Human Services, said in an email that the monthly benefits will remain unchanged in fiscal year 2012 because that language was eliminated. State funding for the general assistance program remains slightly below the fiscal year 2011 level, but that’s due to other program changes, Brossoie said. Of Cunningham’s resolution, Brossoie said, "No change would have been made to cash benefits." So, let’s be clear: Cunningham urged her colleagues to maintain $140 monthly payments that were not being cut. Cunningham told PolitiFact New Jersey that at the time she made the statement she believed the Senate resolution would restore the $15 cut to monthly payments. She later acknowledged that the monthly benefits have been restored to their prior levels, but declined to comment further. But what about Cunningham’s claim that losing general assistance payments could drive some recipients to commit crimes? Two experts said general assistance payments won’t necessarily prevent crime. "There is certainly a link between poverty and crime, but it’s not so simple that a small payment would fix it," said John Roman, executive director of the District of Columbia Crime Policy Institute. The ruling Cunningham strongly implied the state budget cut monthly general assistance payments, but the budget actually kept those payments intact. The senator also said losing that money could lead to more crime, but two experts said the payments wouldn’t necessarily prevent criminal acts. Cunningham acknowledged the monthly benefits were restored, but it is still ridiculous for her to claim people will commit crime in response to losing general assistance payments, when those payments aren’t changing at all.

pomt-11860	"We’re growing union jobs faster than Illinois."	true	/illinois/statements/2017/nov/03/eric-holcomb/indiana-governor-right-gloat-about-union-jobs-succ/	If you watched more than an inning of the 2017 World Series, you probably saw an unusual ad from the re-election campaign of Gov. Bruce Rauner. Titled "Thanks, Mike!," the 30-second spot features the governors of Missouri, Wisconsin and Indiana extolling the economic success of their states and "thanking" Rauner’s arch political rival, Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan, D-Chicago, for thwarting Rauner’s reform agenda during the Republican’s first term. Rauner doesn’t appear in the ad. Instead, Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb, all Republicans, look into the camera and boast of their states’ economic gains, which they attribute to policies enacted by Madigan ("raising Illinois’ taxes," says Walker) or prevented by him ("blocking Rauner’s reforms," says Greitens). The most specific claim comes from Holcomb of Indiana: "We’re growing union jobs faster than Illinois." Given Indiana’s status as a "right-to-work" state that bans compulsory union membership and Illinois’ status as one of the most union-friendly states in the nation, Holcomb’s statement invites a closer look. Union gap The Rauner campaign said Holcomb’s claim is based on a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report from January 2017 on union employment and membership. The report shows that from 2015 to 2016 -- the first two years Rauner was in office -- workers represented by unions in Indiana grew from 319,000 to 335,000, an increase of 5 percent. During that same time, workers represented by unions in Illinois fell by 4 percent, from 892,000 to 856,000. The difference between the two states is all the more striking when considered against Illinois’ longstanding reputation as a union stronghold. The report notes that Illinois is among a handful of states that account for most of the union membership in the nation: Over half of the 14.6 million union members in the U.S. lived in just 7 states (California, 2.6 million; New York, 1.9 million; Illinois, 0.8 million; Pennsylvania, 0.7 million; and Michigan, New Jersey, and Ohio, 0.6 million each), though these states accounted for only about one-third of wage and salary employment nationally. Trend tracking Illinois’ 2015-16 union numbers are no statistical fluke. Even before the Great Recession, Illinois had been losing union jobs at a faster clip than its neighbor to the east. From 2006-07, the number of workers represented by unions in Illinois fell from 979,000 to 884,000, a decrease of nearly 10 percent. Indiana’s union job losses in that period were less than 1 percent -- from 334,000 to 333,000. Michael Hicks, an economics professor at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., who tracks Midwest job trends, says the pattern bucks conventional wisdom. "In 2006-07, in the wake of the very difficult manufacturing employment period, Illinois and Indiana shed both public and private union jobs," Hicks said in an email. "But Indiana was holding on better, when it should not have because we are a more manufacturing intensive state (and private sector unions are more tied to manufacturing)." Greater Chicago’s large and diverse economy should have provided a buffer for the state’s overall jobs picture, but that hasn’t happened, Hicks said. "In the most recent data, Indiana is well outperforming Illinois in both private and public sector union job growth. Given the very large agglomeration economy that is Chicago, this should not be the case," Hicks said. Unemployment figures over the past decade also attest to Illinois’ job struggles relative to Indiana. While both hit peak unemployment in January 2010 -- Illinois at 11.2 percent, Indiana at 10.9 percent -- Indiana’s post-recession recovery has been significantly stronger. Indiana ended 2016 with 4 percent unemployment while Illinois was at 5.7 percent. The most recent figures, from September, have Indiana at 3.8 percent and Illinois at 5 percent. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Gratitude deserved? This leads to the big question about the ad: Does the speaker of the Illinois House -- who also happens to be chairman of the Democratic Party of Illinois -- deserve the thanks of Govs. Greitens, Walker and Holcomb? Have policies driven by a Democrat-led General Assembly caused Illinois’ economic woes? Hicks is neither dismissive nor completely accepting of the governors’ claims. "While I am not ready to say with scientific certainty that the budget and pension crises facing Illinois are the sole reason for lagging job growth," Hicks said, "the uncertainty about future tax rates and the risk of interrupted public services must surely be playing a role in Illinois’ poorer than expected economic performance in the post-recessionary period." Our ruling Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb said Indiana is "growing union jobs faster than Illinois." The latest report on union membership and representation from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics backs Holcomb’s claim, with Illinois losing 5 percent of its union jobs between 2015 and 2016 and Indiana gaining 4 percent. It’s a trend that predates the Great Recession and, in the bigger jobs picture, is backed by a decade’s worth of unemployment figures in the two states. We rate this statement True.

pomt-09574	"At the beginning of the last decade ... America had a budget surplus of over $200 billion. By the time I took office, we had a one-year deficit of over $1 trillion and projected deficits of $8 trillion over the next decade."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/27/barack-obama/obama-claims-us-budget-went-surplus-deficit-ten-ye/	A big part of President Barack Obama's first State of the Union speech on Jan. 27, 2010, focused on the economy. To set the stage, he said his predecessor was largely responsible for the country's fiscal shape. "At the beginning of the last decade ... America had a budget surplus of over $200 billion," Obama said. "By the time I took office, we had a one-year deficit of over $1 trillion and projected deficits of $8 trillion over the next decade. Most of this was the result of not paying for two wars, two tax cuts, and an expensive prescription drug program." We've checked several claims to this effect in the last year, most recently one by Obama adviser David Axelrod. Indeed, we found that the government was enjoying a surplus of about $236 billion circa 2001. Later, when Obama took office, the Congressional Budget Office reported the deficit was over $1.2 trillion. A good chunk of the deficits racked up by the Bush administration came from tax cuts, the war in Iraq and actions that Bush and a Democratic Congress took to prop up the economy right before he left office. In the same report, the CBO projected a 10-year deficit of about $3.1 trillion. But Obama said $8 trillion, based on budget numbers published by the White House Office of Management and Budget shortly after Obama took office. Why the discrepancy? When we checked the similar claim by Axelrod, we spoke with Josh Gordon, policy director for the Concord Coalition. He said it has to do with how the two offices estimate the future. The CBO bases its projections on the assumption that the Bush tax cuts would expire in 2010 and that a patch to fix the alternative minimum tax would expire, among other things. The White House does not; instead, it assumes that nothing changes in current law. So, Obama's overall point is correct that the government was enjoying a substantial surplus when Bush took office and had a big deficit when he departed; he's spot on about the surplus Bush began with. He's also correct about the deficit at the end of Bush's presidency, but there are two different ways to measure the 10-year projection when Bush left office. The CBO's estimate is $5 trillion lower than the White House numbers, though economists don't quibble with the White House methodology. So given that discussion, we'll take Obama down a notch to Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2010-01-27T23:35:57	2010-01-27	['None']
pomt-07932	"We're borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/27/kent-conrad/kent-conrad-said-were-borrowing-40-cents-every-dol/	Government borrowing needs to be brought back under control, and the solutions are not easy, said Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., on This Week with Christiane Amanpour. "The American people say, don't touch Social Security, don't touch Medicare, don't cut defense," Conrad said. "That's 84 percent of the federal budget. If you can't touch 84 percent of the federal budget -- and, by the way, they also don't want to touch revenue -- you're down to 16 percent of the budget at a time we're borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend. "So, you know, there needs to be leadership to help the American people understand how serious this problem is and that it's going to take a lot more than cutting foreign aid and taxing the rich. You're not going to solve the problem that way." Conrad was one of three senators who appeared on This Week to discuss bipartisanship. Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn., and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, also appeared. All three have announced they intend to retire in 2012. We wanted to check Conrad's statement that "we're borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend." We looked at whether Social Security, Medicare and defense constituted 84 percent of the federal budget in a different fact-check. We turned to the U.S. Treasury Department's Monthly Treasury Statement of Receipts and Outlays of the United States Government. For the most recently completed fiscal year, 2010, the department reported that the government had revenues of $2.16 trillion, spending of $3.46 trillion and a deficit of $1.29 trillion. Divide the deficit by the outlays and you get 37 percent, which is very close to 40 percent. We initially found the numbers a little confusing, but one of the experts we interviewed for this story explained it this way: "It's like a family that earns $60,000 per year, but is spending $100,000. How are they doing it? By getting a new $40,000 loan every year to cover the difference," said Brian Riedl, a budget expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation. In rating Conrad's statement, we find he correctly described how much the government is borrowing in comparison with what it's spending. We rate his statement True.

pomt-08575	On Lee Fisher’s watch, "almost nine out of 10" jobs that Ohio lost were lost to other states, "not to other countries."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2010/sep/27/rob-portman/portman-raps-lee-fisher-and-administration-saying-/	Rob Portman makes a unique bogeyman for his opponent : He’s a Republican who not only supported foreign trade policies, which his foes blame for Ohio job losses, but he also personally advised a president on expanding trade. He personifies the policy. Yet Portman, a Republican running for U.S. Senate, has a uniquely good comeback. He says that while many companies have survived thanks to the export opportunities of foreign trade, Ohio lost lots of other jobs to other states on the watch of his opponent, Lee Fisher -- the irony being that Fisher, a Democrat and Ohio’s lieutenant governor, was also Ohio’s development director, in charge of bringing new jobs to the state. It’s a blame game with resumes perfectly tailored for the respective attacks. But who’s more to blame for Ohio’s job losses? The guy who promoted trade with China and Mexico and saw jobs cross those borders? Or the guy who as Ohio development director saw too much development cross state borders, not international ones? Portman, appearing with Fisher before The Plain Dealer editorial board on Sept. 14, said that if you want to compare the validity of these opposing claims, data from the state backs up his: more jobs went to other states than went abroad. "It may surprise you to learn that when you look at the state’s own data in terms of job loss, that almost nine out of 10 jobs we have lost in the last three and a half years during the Strickland-Fisher administration have gone to other states, not to other countries," Portman said, referring to Fisher and Gov. Ted Strickland. "Think about that. So companies have left Cleveland to go to Indiana. Companies have left Cleveland to go across the border to Michigan. And yet it’s easy in a campaign to fan the flames of protectionism" and to claim that the jobs went to "Mexico or Canada or, more likely, China." We asked about that data, went to the state’s website to see for ourselves, and laid it out in an Excel file. What we saw, however, were alternate versions of the same reality -- one that supports Portman and yet simultaneously presents as many holes as aged Emmental cheese. So before we put this to the Truth-O-Meter, let us show you the numbers, starting with Portman’s view of them. The "state’s own data" comes from the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services, or ODJFS. In concert with the U.S. Department of Labor, ODJFS publishes quarterly reports of "Mass Layoff Events," based on surveys of companies with 50 or more initial unemployment claims filed within a five-week period. The surveys, conducted by telephone, ask why the layoffs occurred and whether they were associated with jobs being moved from one place to another. If so, the survey asks where these jobs went: Somewhere else in Ohio? Some other state? Some other country? Reviewing these quarterly reports, we found missing numbers and an error the state had made. After we discussed this with ODJFS, the agency went back and updated one quarterly set of numbers. That changed the outcome of the tally, but only slightly. Because Portman relied on the old data, we will still use the old data to evaluate his claim. From January 2007 through March of 2010, 842 jobs were lost in Ohio because companies moved operations overseas, the old reports showed. That’s a small number compared with the 5,215 jobs lost in Ohio because companies moved their operations to other states, as the state data showed. Put another way, it means that of the jobs that left Ohio, only 13.9 percent went overseas -- and 86 percent went to other states. Now consider Portman’s words: The state’s "own data" shows that "almost nine out of ten jobs we have lost in the last three and a half years during the Strickland-Fisher administration have gone to other states, not to other countries." Eighty-six percent is close enough to nine out of ten. So Portman is right -- yes? Well, yes -- except for the caveats. Let’s start with those from the state. ODJFS quarterly reports note that employers with fewer than 50 workers are not part of the surveys, so these numbers do not include small companies. That exclusion partly explains why the total number of lost jobs counted in these Ohio quarterly reports -- 264,016 since January 2007, including the vast majority that had little to do with the movement of work -- is lower than you’ll see in other reports of job losses. Then there’s the U.S. Department of Labor, whose Bureau of Labor Statistics sets the survey standards and points out that "movement of work" is defined as work that will be performed by a company or for a company in a new location. Movement is easy to report when a company shutters one plant and reopens another, whether in Juarez, Mexico, or Kokomo, Ind. The definition also applies if a company signs a contract to have its widgets manufactured in Shanghai, China. These are hypothetical examples, because the state reports do not give the exact place of relocation. But if a large company with a big supply chain starts using a widget supplier in Mexico and stops buying from a supplier in Ohio, and that Ohio supplier loses so much revenue that it shuts down, those lost jobs are not counted in the "movement of work" column. Those jobs, then, do not wind up in Portman’s comparison. That’s the biggest problem. We asked Policy Matters Ohio, a think tank, for its latest report on trade adjustment assistance, or TAA, a federal assistance program for workers displaced because of foreign trade. In 2009, 20,677 Ohio workers were deemed potentially eligible for the program, and 9,455 more were in 2008, according to TAA certification reports reviewed by Policy Matters. That suggests that job losses from trade were massively higher than those attributable to companies moving out of state. But some of those workers eligible for TAA wound up keeping their jobs or getting rehired, such as when General Motors’ Lordstown plant began rehiring. Others found work elsewhere; a precise number does not exist, which presents a problem for all of these comparisons. Everyone is talking about fruit, but they’re often comparing apples with persimmons. PolitiFact Ohio has previously examined claims by Strickland and Fisher that trade deals cost specific numbers of job losses in Ohio. We have found trend lines that appear believable, but the reports and statistics the officials cite rely on extrapolations or suppositions. Someday the comparative data may exist; until then, each side in this debate simply argues a point that sounds as if it could be true -- and certainly rings true to those affected -- but that lacks the accuracy that advocates suggest when they trot out their numbers. So we return to Portman’s claim. Portman’s spokeswoman, Jessica Towhey, says the candidate made clear that he was referring solely to state data and the movement of jobs out of state, compared with those moved out of the country, when he said that nine out of 10 jobs lost in Ohio went to other states, not other countries. In such a narrow construct, Portman’s statement might be considered accurate but there is more to this picture. Here are the numbers as updated: From Jan. 1, 2007, through March 31, 2010, Ohio lost 4,820 jobs due to company moves out of state (not the 5,215 in the reports that existed when Portman viewed them). It lost 1,125 more when companies closed operations in one part of the state but relocated elsewhere in Ohio. And it lost 842 jobs when companies moved operations abroad. This is out of 264,016 jobs counted as lost altogether in this particular series of reports -- reports that ODJFS spokesman Ben Johnson say capture just "a subset" of all layoffs. When a statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, the Truth-O-Meter says it is mostly true. That’s how we find Portman’s claim: accurate in a narrow context but needing clarification, and so, Mostly True.	None	Rob Portman	None	None	None	2010-09-27T13:10:00	2010-09-14	['Ohio']

pomt-13403	Says a change in law he carried stopped a $100 million tax increase in the Dallas school district.	true	/texas/statements/2016/sep/23/paul-bettencourt/paul-bettencourt-says-voting-threshold-he-champion/	For almost any elected official, a $100 million item funded by taxpayer money is a big deal. So we sat up when state Sen. Paul Bettencourt, R-Houston, took credit for stopping such a Dallas tax hike. Bettencourt said in an Aug. 24, 2016, press release: "Stopping a $100 million... tax increase will be a record that will stand for some time." We wondered if indeed a Bettencourt-backed change in law stopped the described hike. Bettencourt, who chairs the Senate Select Committee on Property Tax Reform and Relief, said that during the 2015 legislative session, he offered a revision to a measure authored by state Sen. Brandon Creighton, R-Conroe. The adopted tweak, Bettencourt said, imposed a higher voting threshold for "local taxing units to assess property tax increases in their jurisdictions." And, the release indicated, the Dallas school board recently failed to approve the described tax hike because advocates didn’t clear the higher threshold. We checked: In 2015, Creighton authored and Bettencourt amended Senate Bill 1760, which was signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott on June 15, 2015, and became law on Jan. 1, 2016. The Texas Association of School Boards spells out how a tax ratification election, or TRE, works: "Texas law requires school districts to calculate two taxes rates -- the effective tax rate and the rollback tax rate... Generally, if a school board adopts a tax rate above its rollback tax rate, it must hold an election to ratify that rate." The TASB guidance continues: "If a majority of the votes cast in the election favor the proposition to approve the rate, then the tax rate for the current year is adopted by the board. If the proposition is not approved, the board may not adopt a rate higher than the rollback rate." But before the question can get to voters, thanks to the new state law, it takes a 60 percent vote from the school board to put it on a ballot. Voter may then approve the tax increase with a majority vote in an election. Through 2015, state law required a simple majority vote of the school board and voters alike. Upshot: Local taxing authorities must secure a supermajority vote, or 60 percent, whereas to adopt a new tax rate higher than its rollback tax rate. Through 2015, state law required only a majority vote of a local board. So, what exactly happened in Dallas? On Aug. 19, 2016, the nine-member Dallas Independent School Board voted on whether to ask Dallas County residents to consider a 13-cent property tax increase, which supporters said would raise about $104 million to fund early childhood education programs and other initiatives in the district. According to a briefing the trustees received that month, the estimated $104 million would have been spent three ways: -- $40 million for expanding access to early childhood education, including full-day pre-kindergarten -- $32 million for teacher compensation -- $32 million for expanding college preparation programs at district high schools After the vote, some board members said they remained committed to finding the money elsewhere in the district’s budget. "Our hope is to do our best with the money that we have to expand all three of those programs, but that’s a challenge given that there was $105 million on the table with the TRE that we won’t have access to this year," board member Dustin Miller said after the vote. "We’ll be looking for possible cuts in other areas in order to free up money to fund those programs." Five trustees voted to put the question on the November 2016 ballot, called a tax ratification election, and four trustees voted against it. The 5-4 vote did not meet the supermajority threshold, per the new law. Residents of Dallas ISD will not see the tax increase question on their ballots in November, and several trustees have said they will go back to the drawing board. Miguel Solis, a board member who voted to send the measure to voters, said the new threshold was single-handedly responsible for killing the TRE idea. Voters likely would have approved the tax increase, though it would have been a tight race, he said. "We discussed (before the board’s vote) whether or not we would be able to pass this thing," Solis told us by phone. Todd Williams, executive director of Commit! Partnership, said the Dallas district is the only one in North Texas not to achieve the requisite supermajority vote needed under the revised law. He leads a consortium of area business, nonprofits, school districts and foundations who focus on local education issues and who supported the TRE. "In the Dallas County area, we’ve seen several districts go for a TRE," he said. "(Commit! Partnership) polled it and it looked like, after we informed voters of the structure and the outcomes, it was going to win about 58 or 59 percent." Also in August 2016, voters in Frisco rejected a similar 13-cent tax increase in a tax ratification election, but in that case, the school board had a super-majority to send the question to voters. According to a WFAA-TV news story, much of the new revenue would have covered an increase in teacher pay and helped address an estimated $30 million shortfall in the district’s 2017-18 budget. Since the law took effect, 33 of the state’s more than 1,000 school boards have cleared the higher hurdle set in place at Bettencourt’s urging and sent the question of a tax increase to voters, according to the education website TexasISD.com. In all but three of those instances -- in the Yantis, Marlin, and Frisco districts -- voters went on to approve the proposed hike, the website said. Our ruling Bettencourt said a change in law he carried stopped a $100 million tax increase in the Dallas school district. You bet your calculator it did though it’s also so that more than 30 other school boards cleared the higher threshold singled out by Bettencourt, each time sending a tax-hike proposal to voters.

The headline on an EmpireSports.co story dated Feb. 28, 2014, says it all: "Colorado Rockies baseball team to sell marijuana brownies at their concession stands." Except the team is doing no such thing, even though Colorado residents voted to decriminalize recreational marijuana in 2012. You might actually have to go outside Coors Field almost two entire city blocks or so to find recreational marijuana edibles, instead. PolitiFact Colorado examined the origins of this claim as part of the inaugural International Fact-Checking Day, April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.org describe the day as "not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts -- and fact-checking -- in politics, journalism, and everyday life." It’s anyone’s guess why this story continues to live on (we have some theories), but it has. It also was flagged by Facebook users as being fake. The disclaimer from EmpireSports.co, which is now defunct and hasn’t posted a new sports story in a couple of years, notes it is "a satirical and entertainment website" that fabricates content. Another page labeled "About Us" further notes that "sometimes we report things we just WISH would happen." There also hasn’t been any activity on EmpireSports.co’s Facebook or Twitter accounts since 2015. The home page does link to EmpireNews.net, a separate website that fabricates news stories and is still up and running. The owner of both sides, Aaron Smith, confirmed to us that all its new sports stories are now also posted on EmpireNews.net. Smith didn’t know why his three-year-old Rockies story was still being shared as if it were recent, but he said he hadn’t noticed any appreciable increase in hits recently.

pomt-11816	"Breaking! Roy Moore’s accuser worked for Democratic leaders and is actively campaigning for Moore’s opponent."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2017/nov/15/activist-mommy/headline-misleads-tying-roy-moore-accuser-democrat/	In response to the Washington Post article about Republican Alabama U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore having relationships with teenage girls in the past, some articles surfaced accusing one of the women of having political motivations. The conservative website Activist Mommy said that Deborah Wesson Gibson, who said Moore solicited dates from her when she was a teenager and he was in his 30s, has worked for national Democrats. The website also said that Gibson is supporting Doug Jones, the Democrat running against Moore in the Dec 12 special election. (Gibson told the Post that she was 17 when Moore asked her out on dates that did not progress beyond kissing.) "Breaking! Roy Moore’s accuser worked for Democratic leaders and is actively campaigning for Moore’s opponent," states the headline Nov. 10. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially misleading, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The Activist Mommy story states that Gibson "is not only a passionate progressive, but she has actually worked for the DNC and is actively campaigning for Moore’s opponent, Doug Jones. .... social media evidence makes clear that she is a fervent supporter of Jones and Democrats in general, and has even worked for the DNC." The website states that Gibson is a sign language interpreter who has interpreted at rallies for former Vice President Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton. We found more details in a report from the Alabama Media Group, AL.com, which stated that Gibson owns an interpreting company, Signs of Excellence, and linked to photos posted on its Facebook page showing her interpreting for Clinton as well as Biden. Fox News showed additional photos on Signs of Excellence’s Facebook page that included Gibson interpreting for U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy’s 2016 Senate bid and appearing with U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, both Florida Democrats. Reached at her Signs of Excellence business phone number in Florida on Nov. 13, Gibson declined to comment. Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Sabrina Singh told PolitiFact that Gibson and her company never received payment from the DNC. The Activist Mommy website shows only a little information linking Gibson to Jones, the Democrat running against Moore. But the information doesn’t show Gibson actively campaigning for him. The site shows Gibson shared a Sept. 20 statement on Facebook by Jones’ campaign announcing that Biden would appear on his behalf. "I was honored to interpret for Vice President Biden in the fall of 2012!" she wrote in a comment, including a photo of her alongside Biden. The website also showed that she shared a story by New York Magazine stating that Democrats have a chance to beat Moore. Gibson, a Delray Beach, Fla., resident, is a long-time registered Republican voter in Palm Beach County. She initially registered without any party affiliation in April 1995 and then switched her registration to Republican in December 1995, according to Susan Bucher, the Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections. She has since remained registered as a Republican. Gibson voted in the presidential preference primary in March 2016 and in the general election in November 2016. We emailed the Activist Mommy, Elizabeth Johnston, and told her that we didn’t see evidence on her website that Gibson was actively campaigning for Jones. She did not provide additional evidence to bolster her claim. Sebastian Kitchen, a spokesman for Jones’ campaign, told PolitiFact that Gibson has played no role in Jones’ campaign. "Her name is nowhere in our volunteer database, we have no indication she ever contributed," he says. "We have no evidence whatsoever that she had anything to do with our campaign." Our ruling The Activist Mommy website states in a headline "Breaking! Roy Moore’s accuser worked for Democratic leaders and is actively campaigning for Moore’s opponent." The website is referring to Deborah Wesson Gibson, who owns a sign language interpretation company. The company’s Facebook photos show that Gibson has interpreted speeches for Democrats including Hillary Clinton and Biden. The website also states that Gibson worked for the DNC; however, a spokeswoman for the DNC says that it never paid Gibson or her firm. The article’s evidence is weak to link Gibson to Jones. Two Facebook shares do not prove that Gibson is actively campaigning for Jones, and the campaign says she has played no role. We rate this claim Mostly False.

Greenhouse gases, and notably carbon dioxide, are produced when burning fossil fuels such as coal and oil for energy. When these gases build up in the atmosphere, most scientists say, they trap heat and raise surface temperatures, leading to changes in climate such as climbing sea levels. For years, one of the key arguments made by opponents of U.S. efforts to cut carbon emissions has been that rising emissions from other big and fast-growing economies, such as China, could swamp any reductions the United States makes. The agreement with China potentially weakens that argument. But congressional Republicans, including incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., weren’t pleased with the terms of the accord. McConnell, who represents a coal-producing state, said so on Nov. 12, 2014, while talking to reporters covering a meeting with newly elected members of his Republican conference. "The president continues to send a signal that he has no intention of moving toward the middle," McConnell said. "I was particularly distressed by the deal he’s reached with the Chinese on his current trip, which, as I read the agreement, it requires the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 years, while these carbon emission regulations are creating havoc in my state and other states across the country." Several readers asked us to check whether McConnell is right that the bilateral agreement "requires the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 years." We turned to the announcement released by the White House on Nov. 12. Here’s the relevant portion: "Today, the presidents of the United States and China announced their respective post-2020 actions on climate change, recognizing that these actions are part of the longer range effort to transition to low-carbon economies, mindful of the global temperature goal of 2℃. The United States intends to achieve an economy-wide target of reducing its emissions by 26%-28% below its 2005 level in 2025 and to make best efforts to reduce its emissions by 28%. China intends to achieve the peaking of CO2 emissions around 2030 and to make best efforts to peak early and intends to increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 20% by 2030. Both sides intend to continue to work to increase ambition over time." Boiled down, the key tasks for China in this deal are: 1.) an intention to max out carbon dioxide emissions around 2030, if not sooner, and; 2.) an intention to increase to about 20 percent the proportion of non-fossil fuels, such as renewables, in China’s energy mix. When we asked for backup on his claims, McConnell’s office made two reasonable points. First, his office noted that the agreement is based on intentions, rather than on ironclad promises with enforcement mechanisms. They pointed to a column by Robert A. Manning, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, an international-affairs think tank, and a veteran of President George W. Bush’s State Department. Manning wrote that "this is not a binding agreement and includes no benchmarks to measure progress or penalties to encourage it." The second point McConnell’s office makes is that China may already have been planning to make these emissions cuts anyway. According to a report in Reuters, the 2030 peak date was "in line with forecasts already made by several state-backed think-tanks, with the China Academy of Social Sciences saying in a study last week that slowing rates of urbanization would likely mean that industrial emissions would peak around 2025-2030 and start to fall by 2040." In theory, China could "simply shut down a lot of plants on Dec. 31, 2029," Jonathan R. Nash, a law professor at Emory University, told PolitiFact. "In that case, the agreement itself doesn't obligate China to take action before 2030." Experts said this is theoretically possible, but, in the real world, unlikely. It will take "significant work" for China to reach the 2030 target, said Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor at UCLA. "You can't stop your emissions immediately. Imagine if China said they would stop emissions today. That would require massive changes to implement -- no increases in driving unless cars were cleaner, no new economic growth without cutting emissions elsewhere, and so on. For China to achieve a cap in emissions by 2030, they will have to begin to find clean energy replacements very soon or seriously limit economic growth." Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University, agreed. "Given the inertia in the economic and energy systems of China and its recent rates of emissions growth, there is absolutely no way that could happen without … an earlier slowing of emissions growth," he said. "No sensible policy would allow" any different course, he said. But as questionable as it is to suggest that China could do nothing until Dec. 31, 2029, and still meet the targets, there’s still a second task for China -- to increase non-fossil fuels to about 20 percent of the nation’s energy mix by 2030. Because no such infrastructure can be created overnight, China will have to start work on this part well before December 2029. Indeed, such efforts already appear to be under way, said Michael B. Gerrard, a law professor at Columbia University who has studied the issue. "China is engaged in a massive program of building wind, solar and nuclear energy plants," he said. Our ruling McConnell said the climate-change agreement between the United States and China "requires the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 years." McConnell’s staff has a point that the agreement isn’t binding and may simply be codifying changes China had already planned to make. Still, his claim is at best an exaggeration. While it’s theoretically possible that China could meet its emissions target simply by shutting down major plants on Dec. 31, 2029, experts say it would be much less risky to China’s economy to spend the next 16 years working toward the goal, rather than doing it overnight. But even if China did choose to make a literal overnight shift on emissions, that still doesn’t account for China’s pledge to increase non-fossil-fuel use to 20 percent of its energy mix. Building that infrastructure cannot be done overnight and will take years to carry out, experts said. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-05330	On support for gay marriage.	no flip	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/15/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-has-maintained-consistent-stance-same/	With President Barack Obama's change of position on gay marriage -- which earned a Full Flop on our Flip-O-Meter -- we thought it was a good time to take a fresh look at Mitt Romney's position on the same issue. Shortly after Obama’s announcement, Romney was pressed about his own stance on same-sex marriage. In each case, he offered similar answers. At a campaign event in Oklahoma City, reporters asked Romney to clarify his position. "My view is that marriage itself is a relationship between a man and a woman. That’s my own preference, and I know other people have differing views. This is a very tender and sensitive topic," he said. Romney added that he believes states should be able to decide whether to offer certain legal rights to same-sex couples, according to the Associated Press. Later, Romney told KETV-TV in Omaha that,"as a society, I think we’re better off if we encourage the establishment of homes with a mother and a father." Same-sex marriage, he said, isn’t "appropriate and needed for a strong society." Meanwhile, in an interview with KDVR-TV in Denver, Romney said, "I don't favor civil unions if they are identical to marriage other than by name. My view is that domestic partnership benefits, hospital visitation rights and the like are appropriate, but the others are not." Finally, in a commencement address at Liberty University on May 12, Romney said that American values, "may become topics of democratic debate from time to time. So it is today with the enduring institution of marriage. Marriage is a relationship between one man and one woman." We wondered whether the opposition to same-sex marriage that Romney offered in the wake of Obama’s announcement represented a change in views. So we put it to the Flip-O-Meter. We’ll start by noting that the Flip-O-Meter rates politicians' consistency on particular topics from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on their decisions to change their minds. It’s simply gauging whether they did. As we wrote in 2007, Romney took a relatively liberal approach on gay rights during his 1994 Senate race against liberal Democratic icon Edward M. Kennedy. During his Senate race, Romney wrote a letter to the Massachusetts branch of the Log Cabin Republicans, which read in part, "I am more convinced than ever before that as we seek to establish full equality for America's gay and lesbian citizens, I will provide more effective leadership than my opponent." He promised the group that he would support laws preventing discrimination against gays and lesbians in the workplace and implied his hope for the eventual full integration of gays in the military, a policy that was ultimately approved 16 years later. A lengthy interview with Romney in Bay Windows, a Boston-area gay newspaper, was headlined, "Romney: I'll be better than Ted for gay rights." But despite making policy overtures to gay voters, Romney consistently drew the line at gay marriage, even as far back as 1994. When Romney was asked by Bay Windows, "Would you support legalized marriage for gay men and lesbians?" Romney responded, "I line up with (moderate Massachusetts Republican Gov. William) Weld on that, and it's a state issue as you know -- the authorization of marriage on a same-sex basis falls under state jurisdiction. My understanding is that he has looked at the issue and concluded that certain benefits and privileges should be offered to gay couples and lesbian couples. But he does not feel at this time that he wishes to extend legalized marriage on a same-sex basis, and I support his position." Then, in 2003, when the Massachusetts Supreme Court opened the doors to same-sex marriage in the state, Romney supported a constitutional amendment that would have banned the practice. Romney maintained his opposition to same-sex marriage during the 2008 Republican presidential primary campaign, saying at one Iowa event that he’s fought same-sex marriage "every way I have known how to, and the fight isn’t over," according to the New York Times. Our ruling In a Sept. 14, 2007 interview on MSNBC, Romney said, "I have not changed my position on the marriage amendment or anything else related to marriage." We have found nothing to contradict this view. While Romney in 1994 offered relatively liberal views on some policies of importance to gay voters, he never went so far as to support same-sex marriage. In fact, he spoke out against the idea -- and took actions to stem it while governor. Romney has been consistent on this. No Flip.

pomt-00608	"The American murder rate is 50 times that of any other developed nation."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/jun/02/russell-brand/russell-brand-misinforms-fans-about-us-murder-rate/	In 2014, eccentric British comedian Russell Brand launched an Internet video show called The Trews, short for "true news." True news! Something PunditFact can get behind. The show usually features Brand offering his opinion on the topics of the day, often about his native England but also sometimes about the United States. In the 327th episode of The Trews, Brand criticizes Fox News pundit Greg Gutfeld for cheering the death sentence for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, convicted for his role in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings that killed three people and injured scores more. Brand said Gutfeld and other Fox News pundits ignore the prevalence of gun violence in the United States that kills a lot more people, throwing out a slew of statistics to capture his point. "In a country that has more guns per person than any other country in the world, where the American murder rate is 50 times that of any other developed nation, where women are estimated to be 11 times more likely to be murdered with a gun than women in any other developed country, why does the focus fall on this particular story?" Brand said. "Because it’s a story that helps to maintain the order." Brand’s soliloquy continued after his round of fact-dropping, but the show being called The Trews and all, we were struck by the claim that the U.S. murder rate "is 50 times that of any other developed nation." Unfortunately, it’s not Trews. "Fifty times is ridiculous," said James Alan Fox, Northeastern University professor of criminology, law and public policy. "Fifty times the homicide rate is much too high," said David Hemenway, a Harvard School of Public Health professor of health policy who studies gun-homicide rates. "Maybe it just was hyperbole." The FBI-estimated homicide rate for the United States in 2013 was 4.6 deaths per 100,000 population. The World Health Organization estimate is a bit higher at 5.4. For our calculations, we’ll use the official and most recent FBI rate of 4.6, though it doesn’t matter either way to debunk Brand’s point. While either estimate is considerably higher than the homicide rate of other Western, high-income countries, it is not remotely as much as Brand suggests. Canada, for example, had a WHO-estimated homicide rate of 1.8 deaths per 100,000 population. So the U.S. rate is a little less than three times higher. The homicide rate in the U.S. was three times higher than the United Kingdom (1.5 per 100,000) and about eight times that of Switzerland (0.6 per 100,000). Compared to Japan (0.9 per 100,000), the U.S. rate is five times higher. We put together a table of of all the developed nations, using the World Bank definition of high-income countries. The reason the United States has such a high homicide rate compared to those countries is tied to the fact that it has more firearms per capita and more permissive gun control laws. A 2003 analysis, while more than a decade old, concluded the U.S. firearm homicide rate was more than 20 times the rate of Australia, France, United Kingdom (except Northern Ireland), Israel, South Korea, Japan, Norway, Poland and Slovenia. (See a related fact-check.) The findings, published in the Journal of Trauma, Injury, Infection and Critical Care, also found that the firearm homicide rate was strikingly larger among American 15-24-year-olds compared to peer countries — 42.7 times bigger, as a matter of fact. That’s closer to the number Brand presented, but it’s not how he presented it. Regardless, experts cautioned against drawing sweeping conclusions about murder rates from country to country. Every nation presents a new set of societal differences, and developing countries in particular have various definitions and methods of counting homicides, said Alan Lizotte, University at Albany professor and dean of the School of Criminal Justice. "It’s not really good to compare countries to each other without considering the culture," he said. The turbulent history of the United States partially explains today’s violent American society, he said, from Western settlers’ hostile encounters with the indigenous population to the haphazard move out west and the underlying history of defending oneself and one’s property. The Canadians, by contrast, were more peaceful as they settled their western territories, sending out mounties to look for new land to inhabit and making peace with the native population first, Lizotte said. "The main point is when you’re comparing countries, you’re comparing things that don’t compare very well," he said. Emails to Brand’s representatives were not returned. Our ruling Brand said, "The American murder rate is 50 times that of any other developed nation." Yes, the American homicide rate is pretty bad, at least compared to most of its high-income peers. But it’s not even close to being as bad as Brand suggests. For instance, the homicide rate in the United States is just three times higher than that in the United Kingdom. Brand considerably overstated things. We rate his claim False. Update (6:30 p.m. June 2) -- After we published our fact-check, a producer for The Trews said Brand meant to say 15, not 50. She said the "n" may have been clipped off due to editing.	None	Russell Brand	None	None	None	2015-06-02T11:43:50	2015-05-26	['United_States']

pomt-11322	"Since 1999, firearm deaths in Ohio have risen 58 percent."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2018/apr/12/richard-cordray/cordray-point-about-increase-firearm-deaths-ohio/	Richard Cordray, a Democrat who has supported gun rights in the past, is playing defense during the Ohio primary for governor on his position on guns. Cordray received an A grade from the NRA and was endorsed by the Buckeye Firearms Association in 2010 when he ran for Ohio Attorney General. But during this campaign he has stated his support for some changes to gun laws, including universal background checks and raising the age to purchase a firearm to 21 in Ohio. One of his May 8 primary opponents, Dennis Kucinich, has portrayed Cordray as soft on guns and attacked him for helping a gun-rights group hold a rally in 2010. On his 2018 campaign website, Cordray has raised concerns about homicide and suicide gun deaths. "The numbers are truly alarming," Cordray wrote, and then cited a series of statistics about gun violence including this one: "Since 1999, firearm deaths in Ohio have risen 58 percent." Cordray is correct about the increase in firearm deaths in Ohio since 1999. Although he didn’t address the reasons behind the increase, we will explain some of the evidence about the increase. CDC data Cordray’s campaign pointed to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing the increase in firearm deaths. There were 8.28 firearm deaths per 100,000 residents in Ohio in 1999 rising to 13.12 in 2016 -- an increase of 58 percent. There was an increase in both the rate of firearm deaths in suicides and homicides. Firearm death data Ohio in 1999 Ohio in 2016 Rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 8.28 13.12 Sheer number of firearm deaths 939 1,524 Cordray used a CDC set of data that started in 1999. But if we looked back a few years earlier in the 1990s, we found a higher rate of firearm deaths -- for example 11.73 in 1991. So if Cordray had drawn on a comparison from an earlier year in the 1990s, it wouldn’t show as much of a contrast as comparing 1999 and 2016. Why did gun deaths increase in Ohio Why gun deaths have increased in Ohio is the more difficult question to answer -- something that Cordray didn’t comment about on his website. Randolph Roth, co-founder of the Historical Violence Database at Ohio State University, told PolitiFact that there has been a tremendous surge in homicides in recent years in Ohio’s major cities. The year 2016 was Cleveland’s deadliest year in a decade. The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported that Cleveland's uptick in homicides was particularly significant but continued an upward trend that began in 2014 and intensified in 2015. Richard Rosenfeld, a criminology professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, pointed to the opioid crisis as a factor in the increase in homicides in Ohio. Using CDC data, he showed that the increases in firearm deaths are primarily in the midwest and Ohio. "The opioid increase is disproportionately concentrated in the midwest and also concentrated among whites," Rosenfeld told PolitiFact. Rosenfeld elaborated on that point in a 2017 paper for the National Institute of Justice in which he called for more research on the causes behind the homicide rise. Jim Irvine, a volunteer with the Buckeye Firearms Association, noted that CDC data shows an increase in suicides overall and that "guns are one of several methods/tools used." CDC data shows that the rate of suicides both by firearms -- and without firearms -- increased between 1999 and 2016 in Ohio. The Buckeye Firearms Association hasn’t endorsed in the Democratic primary but did endorse Attorney General Mike DeWine in the Republican primary. The association endorsed Cordray for Attorney General when he ran against DeWine in 2010. Our ruling Cordray said on his website that "since 1999, firearm deaths in Ohio have risen 58 percent." Data from the Centers for Disease Control showed that there were 8.28 firearm deaths per 100,000 residents in Ohio in 1999 rising to 13.12 in 2016 -- an increase of 58 percent. Firearm deaths in suicides and homicides increased. If Cordray had selected an earlier year in the 1990s, the contrast would not have been as extreme when there was a higher rate of firearm deaths. However, his comparison of 1999 and 2016 is one valid way to examine the data. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-08618	"Speaker Pelosi ... has been busy sticking the taxpayer with her $100,000 bar tab for alcohol on the military jets that she's flying."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/21/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-accuses-nancy-pelosi-spending-100/	Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., delivered one of her signature hard-hitting speeches at the Values Voter Summit, a conference for socially conservative activists on Sept. 17, 2010. At one point, Bachmann took a shot at the woman who leads her chamber, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Pelosi, Bachmann said, "has been busy sticking the taxpayer with her $100,000 bar tab for alcohol on the military jets that she's flying." Bachmann was referring to the Air Force jets that Pelosi uses to fly internationally and back to her home in San Francisco. (Her Republican predecessor, Dennis Hastert of Illinois, used them as well, under a program approved under President George W. Bush.) Bachman's claim drew a rapid counterattack from the Speaker's office, as aides revived arguments they'd used when the allegation first surfaced months earlier. Among other things, Pelosi's office noted that the Speaker "does not drink alcohol" and that there "is no alcohol service on the domestic flights the Air Force operates for travel from Washington to San Francisco for the Speaker." Two politicians diverging over the facts? Sounds like a job for PolitiFact. We tracked down the original source of Bachmann's allegation, which was a large collection of documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act by Judicial Watch, a conservative group that litigates on public corruption and other issues. In a press release summarizing the findings, Judicial Watch wrote that "the Speaker’s military travel cost the United States Air Force $2,100,744.59 over a two-year period — $101,429.14 of which was for in-flight expenses, including food and alcohol." The release gave as an example one Congressional delegation that traveled from Washington through Tel Aviv to Baghdad between May 15, 2008, and May 20, 2008, "to discuss matters of mutual concern with government leaders." The purchases included "Johnny Walker Red scotch, Grey Goose vodka, E&J brandy, Bailey’s Irish Crème, Maker’s Mark whiskey, Courvoisier cognac, Bacardi Light rum, Jim Beam whiskey, Beefeater gin, Dewars scotch, Bombay Sapphire gin, Jack Daniels whiskey, Corona beer and several bottles of wine," the release said. Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton seized on the party-plane theme. "Speaker Pelosi has a history of wasting taxpayer funds with her boorish demands for military travel," Fitton was quoted as saying in the release. "And these documents suggest the Speaker’s congressional delegations are more about partying than anything else." Other critics of Pelosi piled on soon after the Judicial Watch documents came to light. World Net Daily, a conservative website, led its article by saying that the purchases for the 2008 trip "reads like a dream order for a wild frat party ... But that single receipt makes up just part of the more than $101,000 taxpayers paid for 'in-flight services' -– including food and liquor -- for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi." To Pelosi's critics, it must be irresistible to paint a rival as someone who leads debauched lawmakers on cushy overseas trips, only to stick taxpayers with the bill. But Bachmann's version of the facts is way off base. Bachmann said at the Values Voter Summit that Pelosi "has been busy sticking the taxpayer with her $100,000 bar tab for alcohol on the military jets that she's flying." To us, Bachmann is clearly saying that Pelosi has spent $100,000 specifically on alcohol -- but that interpretation doesn't fly with the Judicial Watch summary. The news release said that the $101,429.14 amount was for "in-flight expenses, including food and alcohol." But our friends at the website FactCheck.org determined that the sum spent on alcohol is a small proportion of that amount and that not all of the expenses were in-flight. "It’s clear that Judicial Watch is counting as 'in-flight expenses' any non-reimbursable Air Force expenditure besides transportation costs," FactCheck.org wrote. "That category actually includes all non-plane costs of the trip, including baggage fees, meeting room rentals and refreshments, and, frequently, good-will lapel pins — as well as meals, ground transportation and lodging in U.S. territory." A spokeswoman for Judicial Watch confirmed to PolitiFact that "the tab amount includes, but is not limited to, alcohol and food." Incidentally, the receipt that was the source of the "frat party" jab in World Net Daily, and which was also linked to in Judicial Watch's press release, shows a decidedly more modest pricetag for the "bar tab" -- namely, $560.28, purchased at what appears to have been a no-frills base exchange at Maryland's Bolling Air Force Base near Washington, D.C. The full receipt isn't reproduced in the FOIA documents, so we can't be sure what percentage is food and what percentage is alcohol. But even if you use the full amount to extrapolate the total paid for alcohol, it doesn't come close to $100,000 Bachmann says. If Pelosi is to be believed that no alcohol is served on her domestic flights (which account for most of the flights she took as Speaker) and if you agree with FactCheck.org that she took a total of 12 international trips, then the total cost of alcohol would have been something less than $7,000, far lower than Bachmann's $100,000. It's fair game to argue that buying liquor for lawmaker jaunts is an unjustifiable taxpayer expenditure even if perfectly legal. However, if Bachmann wanted to criticize these outlays, she should have read the Judicial Watch news release more closely. Since Bachmann (or her staff) didn't do so, she ended up citing a figure for alcohol expenditures that was close to the much larger number for all non-plane costs of the trip. We rate her statement Pants on Fire.	None	Michele Bachmann	None	None	None	2010-09-21T10:37:35	2010-09-17	['None']

pomt-10666	"One out of every four homeless people on our streets is a veteran."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/26/john-edwards/study-quantifies-homeless-vets/	In a Christmas message that ran as a television ad, John Edwards said he wanted to remember the less fortunate. He opened with the surprising statistic: One in four homeless people is a vet. Counting the number of homeless people is a challenging proposition, much less quantifying their military backgrounds. The number appears to come from a November 2007 study from the National Alliance to End Homelessness. The nonprofit used data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs that estimated the number of homeless veterans in a given VA facility's service area. The alliance than combined that data with their own population estimates for the homeless nationwide. The study cited data from 2005 that showed out of 744,313 homeless people in a given year, 194,254 were veterans. That means that 26 percent of the homeless are veterans, even though veterans only make up 11 percent of the U.S. population over 18 years old, according to U.S. Census data. The study counted people who were homeless at any time, even briefly, during the year, not just the chronically homeless. It's also worth noting that the number of homeless veterans fluctuates over time because of natural demographic changes and because of the numbers of people who served in the military at any given time in history. Homeless advocates expect the percentage of homeless veterans is a number that changes as the years go by. The 2007 study is an estimate, but it's based on data compiled, at least in part, by a federal agency, and it appears to be the latest data available. Other studies have found lower estimates of the national homeless population, but using a more conservative number for the overall homeless would have the effect of increasing the percentage of homeless veterans. Although Edwards is relying on the best available data, it's still extremely difficult to count homeless people because not all of them come in contact with service providers or other agencies. Some have health issues like addiction and mental illness that make them reluctant to be counted. Even reputable studies sometimes find different estimates for the homeless. Though the percentage of homeless veterans is an estimate, the number Edwards cites appears to be based on the latest available and was partially compiled by the federal agency that serves veterans. So he is on solid ground. But we have to take off a little bit for his emphatic statement of what's actually a complex estimate. For that reason, we find his statement to be Mostly True.

pomt-03774	"Almost 1,000 people a day" are moving to Florida "because they are more free here than they are in some other states."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/apr/02/will-weatherford/will-weatherford-says-1000-people-day-move-florida/	Americans are relocating to Florida in droves, House Speaker Will Weatherford told a group of liberty-loving activists at the Capitol. Why? Freedom! It’s a quantity in short supply in those tax-loving states up north. "You may not know this, but today almost 1,000 people a day are moving to the state of Florida," he said at a rally by Americans for Prosperity Florida on March 19, 2013. "Do you know why they're coming here? Because they are more free here than they are in some other states." We checked out Weatherford’s number for new Floridians and why they’re coming here. Grab your U-Haul and come along for the ride. Population estimates Weatherford spokesman Ryan Duffy sent us a March 2013 Sarasota Herald-Tribune article about Florida’s booming population growth. "Fueled by job seekers, foreign immigrants and baby boomer retirees," Florida will soon surpass New York in population, the article states. Duffy honed in on one line: "Moody's is among those predicting Florida's population will swell by 360,000 this year." Weatherford divided 360,000 by 365, which comes out to 986.3 (or "almost 1,000 people a day"). Chris Lafakis, the Moody’s Analytics senior economist behind the projection, told us his figure is based on net migration, which is the number of people moving in minus those moving out, plus the number of births minus deaths. It includes people who move here from other countries, not just other states. Mekael Teshome, a PNC Financial Services Group economist, told us the Moody’s projection is on the high side, and his estimate for population growth in 2013 is in the upper 200,000s. Weatherford is not the only politician touting the number of people moving into the state. Gov. Rick Scott said on CNN and in other interviews that 230,000 people moved to Florida in 2012, referencing census numbers. We should note that people have been moving to Florida since the state was founded. In the 1980s, when Democrats controlled most every branch of state government, about 875 people on average moved to Florida every day, according to census figures. In the 1970s -- while Democrats were in control -- an average of 810 people moved to Florida every day. In the 2000s, during the economic crisis and under Republican control, an average of around 772 people moved to Florida every day. Why Florida? We thought of a few ways to interpret Weatherford’s claim that people are moving to Florida because of freedom. Cubans who arrive on Miami-Dade shores? Fair to say they are moving here for freedom. New York retirees trading in their down coats for swim suits? We’re not sure they’d say freedom (unless they mean freedom from snow). Asked to clarify Weatherford’s remarks, his spokesman sent us materials indicating he meant economic freedom. He directed us to a study by the business-backed Tax Foundation that showed Florida ranked No. 27 of states with the highest tax burdens. New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and California topped the list. Does this really explain our population boom? Economists typically don’t factor in value judgments, Teshome said. But they still have an idea of what brings people to, ahem, the Sunshine State. "Florida’s great weather and abundant white-collar job opportunities are what primarily attract individuals," Lafakis said, "but the lack of a personal income tax and a pretty friendly business climate certainly help." The population uptick is picking up as the result of an improving national economy that enables out-of-staters to sell their houses and buy new ones in Florida, Teshome said. The University of Florida’s Bureau of Economic and Business Research conducts a random monthly telephone survey of state residents. For respondents who say they have moved to Florida, be it one year ago or many, researchers ask about their primary reason for the move. From January 2012 to February 2013, the top results were family/marriage (29 percent), job (22 percent) and climate/weather (18.9 percent). The "other" category, which includes reasons such as retirement, and makes up 14.6 percent of results. Jobs are the main reason people relocate to Florida in their 20s, 30s and 40s, said Stan Smith, professor of economics and director of the Population Program in the Bureau of Economic and Business Research (BEBR) at the University of Florida. For those in their 50s and 60s, climate is the No. 1 reason. Family reasons are a factor in basically each age group, he said. "Freedom" itself is not a category, though 2.1 percent said they moved for the low cost of living and 1 percent said political reasons. Florida’s cost of living used to be substantially lower than the rest of the states 30 or 40 years ago, but the state moved to the middle of the pack in recent years, Smith said. And even though Florida does not have a state income tax, residents pay more for home insurance, prices for which soared after the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons. Finally, the conservative Mercatus Center at George Mason University releases an annual report examining freedom in each state, using a comprehensive checklist that looks at measures such as taxes and government spending, the liability system, property rights and even throwing a bachelor party. Florida falls in the middle of the pack at No. 23. Florida ranks well above average for education and its fiscal policies, but the state lost standing for its debt burden and restrictions on civil liberties. The center recommended spending less on services such as police and fire protection, airports, parks, and sanitation and ending mandatory minimum sentences for victimless crimes. Our ruling Weatherford said almost 1,000 people a day are moving to Florida "because they are more free here than they are in some other states." The number is actually a projection of the 2013 net migration. In 2012, census data shows that about 630 people on average moved to Florida each day. Our problem, however, is more with his assertion of why people are migrating to Florida. There's no real evidence to suggest it's freedom -- as in the business and tax climate -- as Weatherford suggests. Survey data shows most people move here because of family, jobs and weather. And in fact, when you look at Florida history, the state has seen similar population growth under both Republicans and Democrats. We rate Weatherford's claim Mostly False.

pomt-10682	"We reduced abortion. We increased adoptions by 135 percent."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/13/rudy-giuliani/creative-math-by-an-abortion-rights-mayor/	At the Des Moines Register debate on Dec. 12, 2007, Rudy Giuliani acknolwedged a touchy point for his campaign: He supports abortion rights. But he emphasized that he dislikes abortion and repeated a claim he's made before, that while he was mayor of New York City, the number of abortions declined while adoptions rose. "We reduced abortion. We increased adoptions by 135 percent," he said. We've addressed his previous claims with this ruling and our article "Giuliani's 'culture of life,' defined" , but he used different wording and a different number this time, so we'll examine the new statement. He's right that abortions went down. They declined 16.8 percent during Giuliani's eight-year tenure, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, his wording suggests he took an active, leading role in reducing abortions. That doesn't square with his record. When we examined his tenure for our previous article, we spoke with key players familiar with his record, and they remembered a decidely abortion-rights mayor who went so far as to sign a proclamation for "Roe vs. Wade Anniversary Day." He also filled out a questionnaire for an abortion-rights group pledging his support for the cause. So for him to say "we reduced abortion" seems like a stretch. Two months ago, the Giuliani campaign maintained there was a link between the rise in adoptions and the decline in abortions. They now say he is not linking the two. But we believe many voters could be left with the impression that the two are related. And indeed, we couldn't find any research that showed an increase in adoptions led to a decrease in abortions. There's no question that adoptions rose during his term. But to reach 135 percent requires some serious calculator gymnastics. Two years into his first term, Giuliani created the Administration for Children's Services with a mission to improve the lives of the city's children. The agency aims to help kids in foster care, and it measures its success in large part by how many adoptions it facilitates each year. We focus on page 14 of the ACS 2003 Year End Review, which shows a bar chart of adoptions conducted through the city's child welfare system from 1989 to 2003. Giuliani was mayor from Jan. 1, 1994, to Dec. 31, 2001. His new agency came on line in January 1996. The chart shows a gradual increase in adoptions from 1989 through 1994, then a steeper increase through 1997 — the middle years of Giuliani's tenure. After that year, the numbers decline through 2002. Giuliani has previously said the rate of adoptions went up 65 to 70 percent. His campaign calculated that number by taking adoption rates for the six years before ACS was created and comparing them to the six years after. But now, Giuliani is citing a number twice as large: 135 percent. To get that number, his staff compared adoptions in all eight of his fiscal years against all eight of his predecessors'. This works out to a whopping 133 percent increase in adoptions, which Giuliani rounded up to 135. That's one way to look at it. But a more traditional way, simply comparing adoption rates in the first year of his tenure and in the last year, shows the rate increased by only 17 percent, a point first made by our friends at FactCheck.org. The Giuliani campaign said averaging the rates over two six-year (or now, eight-year) blocks helps smooth out peaks and valleys in individual years caused by social, economic and other forces. The first two years after ACS came on line, there was a spike in adoptions that Giuliani's campaign said was because of a backlog of foster kids waiting to connect with families. It's true, the campaign aides say, the numbers go down significantly in Giuliani's final two years. But they're still higher than those of his predecessor, David Dinkins. We find that's an unorthodox way of comparing the numbers and it relies on a different methodology than the abortion rate. For the abortion statistic, the Giuliani campaign looked at two points in time (the beginning and end of his tenure) and compared the two. Doing that for adoptions yields an increase of 17 percent. But here, they're trying some creative math to boost the number to 133. So, we find that while he's got his numbers right on abortion rates, it's a stretch for the abortion-rights mayor to take credit. We also find he has inflated the adoption figures by getting fancy with his math. It's worth saying again that to arrive at the "135 percent" increase in adoption rates the Giuliani campaign had to change the way it had been calculating those rates just a few months ago. We find his overall claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-07705	A telecom bill could keep the State Corporation Commission from getting rate-of-return information from electric utilities.	false	/virginia/statements/2011/mar/05/ward-armstrong/ward-armstrong-says-telecom-bill/	House Minority Leader Ward Armstrong has been battling with Virginia’s largest electric utilities for more than a year. During the last week of the recently-concluded General Assembly session, that fight spilled into the debate on a telecommunications bill. Armstrong, D-Henry, was irked by several provisions in the legislation designed to modernize regulation as the state moves from a monopoly utility system to a new environment with many competitors. Armstrong, who is exploring a run for statewide office in 2013, charged in a fiery floor speech on Feb. 21 that the bill would allow phone companies to refuse to run new landlines if there was an alternative for customers, such as using cell phone service. He also railed that the State Corporation Commission was worried the legislation could hinder its ability to regulate electric utilities. Although the bill was approved by the General Assembly and is now on Gov. Bob McDonnell’s desk, the acrimony did not die. Several Republicans publicly accused Armstrong of spreading false information on the House floor. Armstrong, in return, defended his remarks. So we looked at both of Armstrong’s charges. Armstrong, in thundering floor speech, compared the regulation bill to a ticking time bomb. "Let me quote the SCC report. ‘If this legislation, SB 1368, would limit such record keeping only to companies required to file rate of return statements annually, this could adversely impact the commission’s ability to get necessary rate of return information from electric utilities such as Dominion Virginia Power and Appalachian Power.’ "Where did that come from?" he demanded, "Where did that little nugget appear, that we’re going to allow Dominion and Appalachian not to submit rate of return information?" The SCC regulates Virginia’s public utilities, including electric companies and certain segments of the telephone industry. The report Armstrong quoted was prepared by the SCC’s Division of Communications and released Jan. 24. As Armstrong said, regulators initially had concerns about rate of return language. Electric utility regulation is complicated, but the SCC explains it this way: Regulated companies like ApCo and Dominion are allowed to "recover through their rates their ‘reasonable and prudent’ operating expenses, plus a ‘fair’ rate of return (profit) on their ‘rate base,’ which is the value of their capital investment in things like generating stations and the distribution grid." Ensuring a fair rate of return requires lots of information on expenses, investments and other activities at the utilities, so there are rules ensuring the electric companies keep the detailed records needed by regulators. The SCC initially worried this law would undermine those rules. So the SCC brought its concerns to the House Committee on Commerce and Labor, where the bill was being debated. The panel amended the bill on Feb. 3 to state: "All public utilities doing business in the Commonwealth that file rate of return statements shall ... maintain all records necessary to prepare and submit annually a rate of return statement." William Irby, director of the SCC’s Division of Communications, told us the amendment satisfied his department’s concerns. "Rate of return is not affected by this bill," he said. Armstrong’s speech pointing to the SCC’s concerns came on Feb. 21 -- almost three weeks after the concerns he was citing had been addressed. Claire Wilker, Armstrong’s chief of staff, said her boss first learned about the change after his floor speech. She said nobody told Armstrong that the SCC’s concerns had been addressed in committee and that corrections had been made. "We were pleased to find out that rate of return had been corrected," she said. "That’s a positive." But Armstrong, speaking the day after he was supposedly corrected, said "I don’t make any apologies when I stand up for the people of my district and for the people of this state." He also said he would not apologize for sending out an e-mail that repeated the incorrect information on electric utilities. Let’s review the record and put this debate to rest. Ward Armstrong told the entire House of Delegates that a telecom bill could undo important regulations on electric utilities. And though he cited a report from the SCC, he spoke on the bill nearly three weeks after the regulatory body’s concerns about the issue were addressed by a House Committee. This is the second time during the 2011 session Armstrong has used faulty or outdated information during floor speeches about electric utilities. On the last occasion, regarding incorrectly stated utility rate increases, we gave him the benefit of the doubt because the error involved data sent by the SCC to Armstrong. There are no excuses this time around. Any delegate speaking about a bill on the House floor should know what the legislation says, especially when changes occurred nearly three weeks before his remarks. We rate Armstrong’s statement False.	None	Ward Armstrong	None	None	None	2011-03-05T08:00:21	2011-02-21	['None']

pomt-07758	"If you printed a $1 bill for the entirety of the $14.1 trillion national debt, the resulting pile of money would weigh more than 136 aircraft carriers."	true	/texas/statements/2011/feb/25/michael-sullivan/michael-quinn-sullivan-says-debt-weighs-more-136-a/	Trivia time: How many aircraft carriers does it take to balance the national debt on a scale? Conservative activist Michael Quinn Sullivan offered the answer in a Feb. 18 e-mail blast: "If you printed a $1 bill for the entirety of the $14.1 trillion national debt, the resulting pile of money would weigh more than 136 aircraft carriers," said the president of the free-market group Empower Texans. Sullivan pointed us to the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which prints billions of dollars each year for the Federal Reserve. According to frequently-asked-questions page on the bureau's website, a U.S. note worth any amount — from $1 to a Benjamin — weighs one gram. About 454 grams equals a pound. According to the Treasury Department’s Bureau of Public Debt, the total outstanding public debt as of Feb. 18 was about $14.1 trillion. So,14.1 trillion dollar bills weigh 14.1 trillion grams, or about 31 billion pounds. At Sullivan’s suggestion, we checked the weight of the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier. According to the military’s Naval Vessel Register, there are a couple of ways to put the carrier on the scale. At its full displacement, including crew, cargo and ammunition, the USS Reagan weighs 98,235 long tons. That’s 220,046,400 pounds. And 136 USS Reagans? About 30 billion pounds. When the ship is ready for service but missing its crew and ammunition, among other variables, the Reagan weighs 77,607 long tons, or 173,839,680 pounds. Multiply by 136 and you’ve got nearly 24 billion pounds of empty aircraft carrier. But what’s the point of an empty ship? We found that other aircraft carriers, fully loaded, weighed about the same. The USS George H. W. Bush weighs in the same as the Reagan, while the USS George Washington weighs 104,017 long tons at its full displacement. That’s 232,998,080 pounds. That means 136 Washingtons weigh about 31.5 billion pounds — 500 million pounds more than the national debt. And the USS Harry S. Truman? They’re a svelte 101,378 long tons at full displacement, so it takes more than 136 of them to equal the the national debt. Weighing in: The national debt in dollars totals more than 136 fully loaded USS Reagan, Bush and Truman aircraft carriers. Other carrier weights differ, but they’re in the ballpark.

pomt-01005	Under Common Core standards, it takes "more than a minute" to teach a student "how to add nine plus six."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/feb/03/greg-abbott/under-common-core-teaching-simple-addition-takes-f/	Under Common Core, it takes far too long for a teacher to show a student how to do simple addition, said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. In 2013, the Texas Legislature passed a law prohibiting school districts from using Common Core in their lesson plans. On Fox News Sunday, Abbott argued that Common Core -- the proposed set of education standards that has become a political football -- is a bad idea. He directed viewers toward some evidence. "I hope all your viewers will go to Google and plug in ‘nine plus six Common Core,’ " he said, telling viewers to find a video on YouTube of a news report out of upstate New York. "You'll find it's going to take you more than a minute to see how a teacher teaches a student to learn how to add nine plus six. Chris, these are the Common Core standards that are now being pushed down from the top that we must get away from." In the video, a teacher gives an addition lesson directed at early elementary school-age children. She adds nine and six by first splitting the six into one and five, then adding the one to the nine to make 10. So the problem becomes 10 plus five equals 15. "Our young learners might not be altogether comfortable thinking about what 9 plus 6 is. They are quite comfortable thinking about their friend 10," the teacher says." Now our students are seeing that we have 10 plus 5…. That is much more comfortable than looking at 9 plus 6." Responding to Abbott on Fox, former U.S. Secretary of Education Bill Bennett, a conservative supporter of Common Core, said, "I haven't seen this (video) but I'm going to tell you if it's crazy, it probably isn't Common Core. It's probably one of these myths that's developed," and he encouraged viewers to read the Common Core standards for themselves. So we decided to download the video as well as the Common Core standards to find out if this addition strategy is in fact a part of Common Core. It turns out that this method is in line with what the Common Core standards drafters had in mind, but it’s not a bizarre concept, as Abbott implies. Math teachers have been using methods like this for decades. The standards First, let’s clarify a couple things. Abbott said these standards are being pushed down "from the top" -- meaning the federal level. Common Core is not a federal mandate -- adopting these standards is voluntary for states (though they can have better access to federal education money if they take them on). Additionally, Common Core does not prescribe or require any particular method of teaching. Nowhere in the standards does it say that teachers must teach addition by first splitting numbers up to create 10. Common Core standards, rather, identify concepts that students should learn at each grade level -- not how teachers should teach them. That being said, the standards do suggest that teachers use methods similar to that used in the video to teach first-graders how to add and subtract within the number 20. It suggests: "Use strategies such as counting on; making ten (e.g., 8 + 6 = 8 + 2 + 4 = 10 + 4 = 14); decomposing a number leading to a ten (e.g., 13 – 4 = 13 – 3 – 1 = 10 – 1 = 9)... and creating equivalent but easier or known sums (e.g., adding 6 + 7 by creating the known equivalent 6 + 6 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13)." Math education experts told us that the method used in the video are in line with the Common Core standards’ intention -- which is to teach children foundational math strategies that they can use for more sophisticated problems down the line. Although it does take the teacher in the video just under a minute to teach the equation, it’s not as if the teacher has to go through those motions for every single addition problem. She’s teaching a strategy that students can apply to other problems on their own. "What Gov. Abbott is missing is that the teacher in the video is doing much more than teaching a fact," said Valerie Mills, president of the National Council of Supervisors of Mathematics. "She is helping students to build an understanding of operations (addition in this case) and of how our number system works." That way, when a child is older and has to add larger numbers, they can use the strategy to add quickly. (For example 149 plus 236 becomes 150 plus 235 to make 385.) It’s also worth noting that one of the reporters in the video says, "When you and I were in school, we used to memorize that nine plus six is 15. Not anymore." That’s actually not the case. By second grade, according to the Common Core standards, students are expected to have these facts memorized, after they learn the foundations of how to add in first grade. How different is this? Abbott makes it seem like this way of teaching addition is a deviation from what schools already do. Diane Briars, president of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, said teachers have used techniques like splitting a number into parts of 10 for addition -- rather than straight memorization -- since the 1950s at least, and the research showing its benefits goes back to the 1920s. She sent us pages in a textbook from the 1990s that includes the method from the video. "It has long been best practice for early childhood math," Briars said. In fact, they match up with Texas’ state standards for first-grade math, said William McCallum, a University of Arizona math professor who was involved in drafting the Common Core standards. The Texas standards say for first-graders: "Students extend their use of addition and subtraction beyond the actions of joining and separating to include comparing and combining. Students use properties of operations and the relationship between addition and subtraction to solve problems." And, more explicitly, students are expected to "apply basic fact strategies to add and subtract within 20, including making 10 and decomposing a number leading to a 10." "The general belief is that the Texas state standards are modeled word for word on the Common Core state standards," Mills said. Although these ideas have been around for so long, that doesn’t mean that all parents necessarily learned with these methods, which might be why they perceive Common Core standards as something foreign, Mills added. "I can see why the governor would watch that video and say ‘oh my gosh,’ " she said. Our ruling Abbott said that under Common Core standards, it takes "more than a minute" to teach a student "how to add nine plus six." There is a video that shows a teacher demonstrating how to add nine plus six to make 15, and it takes just under a minute. But the method she uses is not explicitly required by the Common Core standards, though the standards suggest this approach for teaching addition to first-graders. Abbott’s claim is misleading, though, in that it implies that this method takes an unusually long time or teaches something in a new way. These methods have been around for years and pre-date Common Core. In fact, they align with Texas’ own state standards. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.	None	Greg Abbott	None	None	None	2015-02-03T17:15:46	2015-02-01	['None']
pomt-10550	"She flunked the D.C. bar exam."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/15/chain-email/she-failed-then-followed-bill/	In an article for a conservative Internet journal that has been widely distributed via chain e-mail, former Clinton adviser-turned-foe Dick Morris points out a little-known embarrassment about Sen. Hillary Clinton, who was a star law student at Yale. "She flunked the D.C. bar exam and only passed the Arkansas bar," he wrote. It's true. In his biography of Hillary Clinton, former Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein notes that in the summer of 1973, 817 people took the Washington, D.C., bar exam; 551 of them passed. Hillary Rodham was not one of them. "For the first time in her life she had flamed out — spectacularly, given the expectations of others for her, and even more so her own," Bernstein wrote. Bernstein said Clinton kept the news hidden for 30 years and shocked some of her closest friends when she made the revelation with a passing reference in her 2003 autobiography, Living History. She even spins it into a positive. "Despite the satisfaction of my work, I was lonely and missed Bill more than I could stand," she wrote. "I had taken both the Arkansas and Washington, D.C., bar exams during the summer, but my heart was pulling me toward Arkansas. When I learned that I passed in Arkansas but failed in D.C., I thought that maybe my test scores were telling me something." So she followed Bill Clinton to Arkansas. She became a faculty member in the School of Law at the University of Arkansas, where Bill Clinton also taught. And in 1975, the two married. Wrote Bernstein: "There can only be conjecture about what turn her life — and the nation's — might have taken had she not failed the exam." But she did, and this statement is True.

pomt-00389	"We’re making (Medicare) stronger. We’re making Social Security stronger."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/sep/06/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrongly-says-social-security-and-medi/	President Donald Trump is rejecting the image of policy chaos and bitter staff infighting captured in the latest book by Washington Post editor Bob Woodward. At a meeting with Kuwait’s leader Sheikh Al-Sabah, Trump called the book "fiction" and said in contrast to what it describes, no administration has gotten more done on tax cuts, deregulation and the courts than his. And the accomplishments don’t end there. "We’re saving Medicare," Trump said Sept. 5. "The Democrats want to destroy Medicare. If you look at what they’re doing, they’re going to destroy Medicare. And we will save it. We will keep it going. We’re making it stronger. We’re making Social Security stronger. We’re making our whole country stronger. So all you have to do is look at the achievements." In this fact-check, we look at whether the Trump administration has made Medicare and Social Security stronger. Key takeaways Compared with estimates a year ago, the primary trust fund for Medicare runs out three years sooner. The primary trust fund for Social Security runs out one year sooner. The Republican tax cuts trimmed a year of solvency from the primary Medicare trust fund and had a negative effect on the Social Security trust fund. Medicare Medicare serves almost one out of six Americans. It’s primarily health insurance for people 65 and older, but it also helps millions of citizens with disabilities. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Medicare’s core program, Part A, covers hospital care, and it’s an entitlement. Anyone who qualifies gets the coverage and the government funding is automatic, not subject to the annual budget decisions of Congress. The money for Part A comes out of the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. Payroll taxes provide about 90 percent of the trust fund’s income. Coming in a distant second are taxes on wealthier Social Security recipients, which provide about 8 percent of total revenues. In their 2018 report, the Medicare Trustees forecast that fund would run out of money in 2026. A year earlier, they said it would last until 2029. On Trump’s watch, it lost three years of solvency. In a presentation at the American Enterprise Institute, a market-oriented think tank, the chief actuary at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Paul Spitalnic said two of the lost years were due to lower than expected wage growth. But the other lost year came from the Republican tax cuts. "The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 decreased individual tax rates and as a result, there is somewhat less income coming into the trust fund," Spitalnic said. "That does have an effect of making depletion of the trust fund a year earlier." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Social Security The tax cut law had a similar impact on Social Security. Social Security has two parts -- the Old Age and Survivors Trust Fund, which served 51 million people in 2017, and the Disability Trust Fund, which served 10 million. According to the 2018 Social Security Trustees report, the total price tag in 2017 was $952 billion. The Old Age and Survivors fund is the big one for retired people, with about $2.8 trillion. The Disability fund had $71 billion at the end of 2017. With costs rising faster than income, the larger fund is expected to run dry in 2034. A year earlier, the projection was for 2035. So that’s a loss of one year of solvency. The trustees listed several factors for the worsening situation, including the tax cut law, the expected end of DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an immigration program Trump opposes), and lower-than-expected wage increases. All three reduced the dollars coming into the trust fund. The one bright spot was with the Disability Insurance Trust Fund. While by far the smaller of the two, its projected solvency date was extended by four years, driven by a fall in the number of people claiming benefits. White House staff noted that the economy is growing and growth helps Social Security and Medicare. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the same when the latest trustees reports came out in June. Not all economists agree that growth will solve all. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a deficit control group, argues that growth leads to higher prices, which in turn increases program costs. The White House also said payroll contributions are up since last year. But unless revenues come in faster than outlays, the trust funds continue to lose ground. Outside assessments We asked Olivia Mitchell, a professor and leading analyst of social insurance funds at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, how she would assess the status of Social Security and Medicare. "Trump’s administration has done nothing to strengthen Social Security or Medicare," Mitchell said. Health policy professor Paul Ginsburg with the University of Southern California and the Brookings Institution told us that he’s hard pressed to remember a tax bill that left the Medicare trust fund worse off. "The recent change, where legislation moved the date forward, is very unusual and reflects the unusual and dangerous mindset in Congress of not caring about increases in the deficit," Ginsburg said. Our ruling Trump said that his administration is making Medicare and Social Security stronger. The forecast for both programs is worse today than a year ago. The main Medicare trust fund is expected to run out of money three years sooner. The main Social Security trust fund is expected to run out one year sooner. The Republican tax cut law and lower-than-projected wages accounted for most of the downgrade. We rate this claim False.

pomt-02618	"We had 6,000 oil and gas spills in 2012" with "more oil and gas spreading in the United States than the entire Exxon Valdez spill."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/23/josh-fox/documentary-filmmaker-josh-fox-claims-6000-oil-and/	Some environmental advocates object to calling the seepage of 7,500 gallons of coal-cleaning chemicals into the Elk River (thereby cutting off access to tap water for 300,000 West Virginia residents) as a "spill." Environmental activist and documentary filmmaker Josh Fox offered "state of permanent criminal negligence" as an alternative descriptor in a Jan. 19 appearance on MSNBC’s Melissa Harris-Perry. "A spill is something that happens by accident. You knock over one of these cups on the table, that's a spill," said Fox, director of the 2010 documentary Gasland. "We had 6,000 oil and gas spills in 2012. That was 16 a day, amounting to more oil and gas spreading in the United States than the entire Exxon Valdez spill." Fox’s statement is a bit different from the topic at hand, as the chemical storage facility leak in West Virginia is not an onshore oil or gas production site. Still, we were intrigued by Fox’s statistic and emailed him about his figure. Fox replied with a July 2013 investigation by EnergyWire that almost precisely offered the same information. The story, part of EnergyWire’s five-part "Overflow" series, took reporter Mike Soraghan four months to report. Soraghan examined state and federal data for onshore oil and gas sites in 2012. There is no central, uniform reporting system for companies to report oil and gas leaks at onshore drilling sites, so Soraghan compiled data from 16 oil states using computer-assisted reporting methods. By his count, the best one available, 2012 saw more than 6,000 reported spills "and other mishaps" at onshore oil and gas sites, amounting to "more than 16 spills a day" and "more than the volume of oil that leaked from the shattered hull of the Exxon Valdez in 1989." Most of the incidents were 100-gallon leaks that could be contained and cleaned up in a day, Soragan wrote. In sum, the spills amounted to at least 15.6 million gallons of oil, fracking fluid, contaminated wastewater and other liquids spilled in 2012. The Exxon Valdez oil spill, in which a tanker hit a reef in Prince William Sound, Alaska, resulted in more than 11 million gallons of crude oil spewing from its hull. The EnergyWire report tallies several kinds of toxic spills, not just gallons of crude oil. That's not a perfect comparison to the Exxon Valdez, of course, but it does show the relative scope of accidents occuring at oil and gas sites. Soragan says his number for onshore well spills is an undercount for several reasons, including the fact that some states where drilling is popular don’t always include the amount of liquid, and he did not include spills from offshore wells, interstate pipelines, or from trains. He points out that North Dakota had the most spills in 2012, but it could be a result of its more stringent reporting standards compared to other states (minimum of 1 barrel, or 42 gallons, compared to 10 barrels in Oklahoma and Montana and a 5-barrel threshold in Texas). "If there was doubt, I left it out," he said. (Interestingly, Soraghan authored a fact-check of Fox’s documentary and its attackers when the film was nominated for an Academy Award.) The federal government maintains data for offshore site spills (like the 2010 BP Gulf of Mexico disaster) and some onshore spills at the federal National Response Center and for pipelines at the Department of Transportation. The rest is often left to states. "We imagine that the number is bigger because there are probably spills that haven’t been identified yet and haven’t been reported," said Anna Mall, senior policy analyst for land and wildlife program of the National Resources Defense Council. "It’s a pattern in the country that we’re very concerned about." Spills that occur at well sites usually happen before a well moves into its formal production phase, said Kenneth B. Medlock III, senior director of the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University. And as Soraghan’s report points out, they are cleaned up rather quickly and do not have much effect on the environment. "In general, operators do everything they can to avoid release of any product because oil and gas production volume is what earns the return for the expenditure on the well," Medlock said. Medlock told us finding a true tally for the number of oil spills is difficult because it requires meticulous tracking of well records and an ability to understand the extent -- and therefore the impact -- of a "spill." In 2011, the BP rig explosion and oil spill still fresh in the public’s mind, CBS News published a similar investigation for incidents and wells, as well as pipelines, from 23 oil- and gas-producing states and federal agencies. "Not counting the BP disaster, we found at least 6,500 spills, leaks, fires or explosions nationwide -- that's 18 a day. Overall, at least 34 million gallons of crude oil and other potentially toxic chemicals were spilled. That's triple the size of the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill." We checked in with oil and gas industry officials to see if we were missing anything. The American Petroleum Institute directed us to a 2009 report about overall American oil spill trends from many sources -- refineries, pipelines, cargo ships, offshore wells -- over the last several decades prepared by an outside environmental consultant. According to the study, overall oil spillage is down 77 percent since the 1960s-70s. However, as the EnergyWire report points out, decreases over the previous decade were mainly at offshore platforms and pipelines, refineries and transportation vessels (but not tanker trucks). Spillage at inland production wells increased, according to the American Petroleum Institute report. Our ruling Filmmaker-activist Josh Fox claimed the country had "6,000 oil and gas spills in 2012, ... amounting to more oil and gas spreading in the United States than the entire Exxon Valdez spill." He correctly cites an energy publication’s investigation about the number of spills at oil and gas sites in 2012. We can’t independently verify the data, as there’s no central hub for it and the reporter compiled it mainly from state agencies over four months. The comparison to the Exxon Valdez spill, however, requires a bit more explanation. The report measures oil, fracking fluid and contaminated wastewater spills, which Fox short-handed to "oil and gas." That's not 100 percent correct and requires a minor clarification. As such, we rate Fox's claim Mostly True.	None	Josh Fox	None	None	None	2014-01-23T11:36:46	2014-01-19	['United_States', 'Exxon_Valdez_oil_spill']

pomt-01369	Under Scott Walker’s policies, "the typical Wisconsin family has actually seen their real income drop by nearly $3,000 in the last four years."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/17/mary-burke/mary-burke-says-walker-fault-nearly-3000-drop-inco/	Democrat Mary Burke wasted no time in her first debate with Gov. Scott Walker, rolling out a blistering economic critique in her opening statement. Beyond the expected reference to Walker’s failure to spur creation of 250,000 jobs as he promised, Burke unveiled a new talking point. "His approach isn’t working," she said Oct. 10, 2014. "The typical Wisconsin family has actually seen their real income drop by nearly $3,000 in the last four years. $3,000!" Not so fast, the Republican Party of Wisconsin countered, quickly issuing a news release with this headline: "Mary Burke Opens Her Disastrous Debate Appearance With A New Lie." Let’s go to the Truth-O-Meter. When asked for backup, the Burke campaign cited income figures reported by the Wisconsin Council on Children & Families following the Sept. 17, 2014 release of data through the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. The American Community Survey is the preferred method for tracking year-to-year changes in median household income at the state level. It is based on a random sampling of residents from every state. The income figures are adjusted for inflation, allowing apples-to-apples comparisons over time. Burke called it "real" income, the technical term for the inflation-adjusted approach. The most recent survey year reported 2013 income. So to track the four-year trend, as Burke did, you have to start with 2009 as a baseline and measure changes across 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. Burke’s camp did just that -- but there’s a problem with the method, as we shall see in a moment. Here’s what the survey reported: Year Median household income Dollar change Percent change 2009 $54,210 2010 $52,317 -$1,893 -3.5% 2011 $52,111 -$206 -0.4% 2012 $51,649 -$462 -0.9% 2013 $51,467 -$182 -0.3% 2009-’13 -$2,743 -5.1% Source: American Community Survey That $2,743 drop was big enough drop to be statistically significant, even when considering the survey’s margin of error, census officials told us. And Burke describes it as "nearly $3,000" -- a characterization generally on target, though that $257 difference is not insubstantial. There’s trouble here, though, for Burke. She associates Walker, and Walker alone, with the four-year period she discusses. That sounds reasonable on the surface; the governor’s term is four years, and it’s ending. But there’s no 2014 data yet, so to get four full years Burke has to dip back into the final year (2010) of Walker’s Democratic predecessor, Gov. Jim Doyle. In other words, the census data she cites covers one year from the Doyle era and three years of Walker’s time. Indeed, most of the income drop Burke cites was in 2010, Doyle’s final year, when the median household income fell $1,893 or 3.5 percent. The drop under Walker, in his first three years, amounts to $850, or 1.6 percent. The blame game on economic matters is tricky under the best circumstances. The lingering effects of the national recession, Walker’s cuts to public workers’ disposable income, his tax cuts, the below-average pace of job creation, the national economy -- all those factors and more play into fluctuations in income. But in this instance Burke blames Walker for something that largely occurred before his watch, providing a distorted view for voters. Our rating Saying that his approach hasn’t worked, Burke blamed Walker for income losses, saying, "the typical Wisconsin family has actually seen their real income drop by nearly $3,000 in the last four years." While median household income in Wisconsin has fallen $2,743 in four years, most of the drop occurred before Walker took office in 2011, We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-05034	The United States can immediately tap a domestic energy resource of "more than 1.5 trillion barrels of oil, six times more than Saudi Arabia."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jul/12/eric-hovde/eric-hovde-says-us-has-six-times-more-oil-saudi-ar/	As Wisconsinites geared up to hit the highway for the Fourth of July, Republican U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde declared American energy independence as easy as 1, 2, 3. Here’s the solution to high gas prices and overreliance on foreign oil, a Hovde campaign news release said on July 2, 2012: 1. "Immediately tap into America’s natural resources: More than 1.5 trillion barrels of oil (six times more than Saudi Arabia); 272 trillion cubic feet of natural gas; and more than half the world’s oil shale supply." 2. "End the moratorium on domestic drilling on public lands." 3. "Build the Keystone XL pipeline." There has been much debate about drilling on public lands and the Keystone XL pipeline, which would move oil sands crude from Canada to Gulf of Mexico refineries. But there’s been little discussion of the claim that America has an untapped domestic oil source that tops oil-rich Saudi Arabia by a factor of six. Is Hovde right? Hovde’s campaign pointed us to the Republican website for the House Natural Resources Committee, chaired by U.S. Rep. Doc Hastings (R-Washington). "According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) the U.S. holds more than half of the world’s oil shale resources," the site says. "The most recent estimates (April, 2009) show the region may hold more than 1.5 trillion barrels of oil – six times Saudi Arabia’s proven resources, and enough to provide the United States with energy for the next 200 years." Hovde, the committee website and the USGS are talking about the same thing -- the Green River Formation in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming. But each is using some critically different ways to describe it. The Green River Formation is considered the world’s largest oil shale resource, but only sporadic attempts have been made to explore it -- typically when oil prices spike. The reason: It’s not crude oil that lies beneath the surface, as in Saudi Arabia. It’s oil shale, a solid organic compound that can be converted to oil only when heated to great temperatures. The USGS made clear when it announced its findings in 2009. Huge obstacles including costs, technology and environmental concerns have stood in the way. Let’s start with the non-partisan source, the Geological Survey. Pressed by Congress during a gas-price spike several years ago, the survey analyzed the oil shale resource and determined the Colorado section of the formation by far the most promising. They estimated that 1.525 trillion barrels of "in-place oil shale resources" lie in the Colorado section. That’s the number Hovde and the Republican website mention. But each shortens that to "oil" -- and that’s a big difference. The Geological Survey describes oil shale as "pre oil" because it is not ready-made crude. And the agency’s assessment made an important point: No economically viable extraction method is currently available in the United States, because the process is so technologically and environmentally challenging compared to conventional extraction of actual crude oil. "Much of the resource in Colorado, where the richest deposits of high grade oil shale exist, are buried deep enough that mining is considered impractical or prohibitively difficult and expensive," said Justin Birdwell, a USGS research engineer studying the resource, in an interview. The focus, therefore has been on underground processing technologies, which are unproven. Given this backdrop, the agency concluded in 2009 that it’s unknown how much of that 1.5 trillion barrels is recoverable. That’s still true today, although the agency is developing estimates. Recovery of oil is years or decades away, certainly not "immediate" as Hovde described it. Additionally, when it comes to the Saudi Arabia comparison, Hovde runs into a major apples-to-oranges problem when he says the 1.5 trillion "barrels of oil" in the Green River Formation is "six times more" than in Saudi Arabia. He is comparing Saudi Arabia’s 266 billion of "proved resources" with the 1.5 trillion in the Green River Formation -- but the latter number is only an estimate of the total "in-place" in the formation, without regard to the ability to get it out or get a viable price for it. It’s a "major distinction," as a Congressional Research Service paper on US fossil fuel resources noted in 2010. "Proved reserves are those amounts of oil, natural gas, or coal that have been discovered and defined, typically by drilling wells or other exploratory measures, and which can be economically recovered," the study said. In terms of proved reserves, the US has 20.7 billion barrels -- 13 times less than Saudi Arabia, according to the latest data from the Energy Information Administration, a US government agency. The Republican website Hovde cites was more precise and cautious than the candidate. It said the region "may hold" more than 1.5 trillion barrels, and explicitly compared that to the Saudi’s "proven" resources. Hovde omitted the qualifiers. In any case, according to two Congressional Research Service studies, oil shale "makes poor feedstock for making gasoline, so it might primarily be a source of other liquid middle distillate fuels such as jet fuel or diesel oil, fuels for which there is significant national demand." Finally, Hovde’s claim reminded us of a February 2012 item by PolitiFact National that rated Mostly False a claim by Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich. He said that by one estimate the United States may have "three times as much oil in the United States as there is in Saudi Arabia." That item noted the same apples-to-oranges problem in the comparison. Our rating Hovde suggested that we immediately tap into America’s natural resources, which he said are "more than 1.5 trillion barrels of oil (six times more than Saudi Arabia)." Hovde referred to a massive western United States formation of oil shale, and there’s a kernel of truth in that government officials estimate that 1.5 trillion barrels are contained there. But Hovde omits a critical fact: He’s comparing that uncertain oil shale resource with Saudi oil reserves that have been discovered and defined and can be extracted economically. It’s unknown what the western formation will yield, and it certainly won’t come immediately. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-01578	The United States has "the highest corporate tax rate in the free world."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/09/eric-bolling/does-us-have-highest-corporate-tax-rate-free-world/	Pundits don’t just disagree about what tax rates should be; they also disagree about how high they actually are. On Fox News’s The Five, hosts Bob Beckel and Eric Bolling came down on either side while discussing how the economy has fared under President Barack Obama. America has "the most number of deductions available to corporations," Beckel said. "They pay lower taxes than a lot of European countries do, and under Obama, I have not seen corporate taxes go up all that much." "Just to fact-check you a little bit," responded Bolling, "we have the highest corporate tax rate in the free world." Beckel repeated his point, then Bolling pointed towards Pfizer and Burger King going overseas for what he called "tax inversion." "They’re going there specifically to capture a lower corporate income tax," said Bolling. We separately checked Beckel’s claim about deductions, but in this check, we’ll see whether Bolling is correct that the United States’ corporate tax rate ranks as the highest in "the free world." The rate in theory We decided to focus on the countries that belong to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, a group that includes most advanced, industrialized nations. That fits our bill for a proxy for "the free world." Out of the 34 countries in the OECD, America ranks first with a 39.1 percent corporate tax rate, compared to an OECD average of 24.1 percent. The OECD figure is what’s called the statutory rate, meaning the base rate applied to corporate profits. According to the Tax Foundation, two non-OECD countries -- the United Arab Emirates (55 percent) and Chad (40 percent) -- have a greater statutory rate than the United States. But the UAE is governed by a monarchy and Chad is a developing country, so we don’t think they would fit into the "free world" category Bolling used. The rate in practice PolitiFact, our sister site, has looked at several variations on Bolling’s claim and ruled them Mostly True almost every time. The reason for the "mostly" qualifier is that companies aren’t actually taxed at the statutory rate. Tax deductions -- on health insurance, pensions, and investment returns, for example -- allow corporations to reduce the pool of taxable profits. So economists often look at what they call the effective tax rate, which experts have told us is just as valid a measurement of corporate tax rates as the statutory rate. But whereas the statutory rate is relatively straightforward and uncontroversial, different, reputable organizations have published very different estimates of the effective tax rate that corporations pay. The most recent estimate comes from the World Bank and International Finance Commission, which put the United States’ effective rate for 2014 at 27.9 percent. That’s second-highest behind New Zealand among OECD countries and 15th-highest among the 189 countries measured. In 2011, the Tax Foundation published a survey of 13 prior estimates of the United States’ effective tax rate from 2005 to 2011. All 13 studies pegged the U.S.’s rate as above average, but none had the U.S. rate first overall. Another 2011 study by the Congressional Research Service put the U.S. effective rate at 27.1 percent, slightly lower than the OECD average of 27.7 percent. Taxes are convoluted Different studies disagree on effective corporate tax rates because corporate tax rates tend to vary widely depending on the industry, said Alan Viola, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. "The biggest deduction that varies across countries is how generous the depreciation schedule is," said Alan Viard, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. "When a business does an investment, equipment, a building, they don’t normally get to deduct the whole cost that year. They have to do it over time." Faster is better, said Viard, but depreciation rates vary depending on what types of equipment a company is buying. Many studies also don’t account for what the United States classifies as S-corporations, meaning businesses that pay tax through the individual income-tax system rather than the corporate income-tax system, Viard said. This represents about 30 percent of American companies, he said. So while effective tax rates are a good estimate of the corporate tax burden in the United States, particular businesses’ burden may vary. Our ruling Bolling said the United States has "the highest corporate tax rate in the free world." He was referring to the statutory rate, meaning the rate before deductions. On that score, he’s right: The United States does have the highest statutory rate among developed countries. However, the United States’ corporate tax rate doesn’t appear to be the highest once deductions and other exclusions are taken into account. So Bolling is correct by one valid definition. Because his statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Eric Bolling	None	None	None	2014-09-09T11:01:09	2014-09-01	['United_States']
pomt-13487	Says Russian President Vladimir Putin "calls me brilliant."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/08/donald-trump/did-vladimir-putin-call-trump-brilliant/	Donald Trump defended his praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin during NBC’s Commander-in-Chief Forum, claiming he was only returning the favor. NBC host Matt Lauer listed some of the things Trump and Putin have said about each other, and asked if Trump wants admiration from someone who is at odds with U.S. foreign policy and may be meddling with the election. "You said, ‘I will tell you, in terms of leadership, he’s getting an A, our president is not doing so well. And when referring to a comment that Putin made about you, I think he called you a brilliant leader, you said, ‘It’s always a great honor to be so nicely complimented by a man so highly respected within his country and beyond,’ " Lauer said. "But do you want to be complimented by that former KBG officer?" "Well, I think when he calls me brilliant, I’ll take the compliment, OK?" Trump said, "The fact is, look, it’s not going to get him anywhere. I’m a negotiator." While Lauer and Trump both claimed that Putin called Trump "brilliant" during the forum, we are putting Trump’s statement on the Truth-O-Meter. It’s not the first time Trump has brought up the "really nice things" Putin has said about him. "He called me a genius," Trump said of Putin at two campaign events in February, three times in April, in a May interview on CNN, at a June rally in California, twice in July, and at an August town hall in Ohio Trump has been referring to comments Putin made in December 2015, when asked for his thoughts of the billionaire by an ABC reporter. "He’s a very colorful person. Talented, without any doubt, but it’s not our affair to determine our worthiness — that’s up to the United States voters. But he is absolutely the leader in the presidential race," reads the captions on the ABC video. The Russian president’s words got lost in translation in some corners of the American press. CNN, Buzzfeed, the Washington Examiner, the New York Post, The Hill all quoted Putin calling Trump "brilliant and talented." Translations from British and Russian media outlets, meanwhile, were closer to the original ABC video. Reuters reported that Putin called Trump "very flamboyant, very talented." The BBC interpreted the comments as "very colorful, talented." And The Guardian amended a previous version of its article from "brilliant" to "very colorful." RT, the television network funded by the Russian government, quoted Putin as saying "very flamboyant." And according to Sputnik, a news agency also controlled by the Kremlin, Putin said "very bright." What accounts for these different interpretations? The word Putin used was "яркий" or "yarkii," which means "bright" or "brilliant." But whereas "bright" and "brilliant" in English are synonyms for both "vivid" and "intelligent," the Russian word "yarkii" does not carry the second meaning. Putin was basically using "yarkii" to mean "colorful" or "strong personality," said Harley Balzer, a Russia expert at Georgetown University, adding that he sees "nothing to support ‘brilliant’" in the intelligence sense from the comments Putin made in December. Russian language experts told our friends at FactCheck.Org the same thing. Putin, himself, denied the "brilliant" translation in a June interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria. "You made some comments about the American Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump. You called him ‘brilliant,’ ‘outstanding,’ ‘talented,’ " Zakaria said. "These comments were reported around the world. I was wondering what in him led you to that judgment and do you still hold that judgment?" "Why do you always change the meaning of what I said?" Putin responded through an interpreter. "I only said that he was a ‘bright person.’ Isn’t he bright? He is. I did not say anything else about him." Our ruling Trump said Putin "calls me brilliant." This is an imprecise translation of Putin’s actual comments. The word he used was "yarkii," which means "bright" as in vivid or colorful, not intelligent or clever.

pomt-12369	"70 percent of Florida is in drought today."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2017/jun/05/al-gore/al-gore-says-70-percent-floridas-drought-today/	Former Vice President Al Gore said that the global community will have to continue to respond to climate change after President Donald Trump’s "reckless" decision to pull out of the Paris climate change agreement. Gore said that evidence abounds that climate change is real (it is ), and people "don’t have to rely on the virtually unanimous opinion of the scientific community anymore." "Mother nature is telling us every night on the TV news now is like a nature hike through the book of Revelation," Gore said on Fox News Sunday on June 4. "People are noticing this, these downpours and historic floods. We’ve had 11 once-in-a-thousand-year downpours in the U.S. just in the last 10 years. We’ve got these wildfires that become mega fires now. Seventy percent of Florida is in drought today. Missouri declared an emergency just a couple of days ago because of another one of these. And they keep on coming." Gore correctly cited a drought figure for Florida from a commonly used drought index. We will explain what that index shows and what the drought means in Florida. Most of Florida is in a drought A spokeswoman for Gore said that he was citing the United States Drought Monitor, a weekly map published on Thursdays showing drought conditions. The monitor, established in 1999, is produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The map is based on measurements of climatic, hydrologic and soil conditions as well as reported impacts and observations from more than 350 contributors around the country. The monitor showed that 71.66 percent of Florida was in a moderate to extreme drought as of May 30. (The previous few weeks it had been between 65 and 66.) See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com While that was the highest this year, there have been multiple other weeks that it reached similarly high levels since 2000. The last time the drought monitor showed Florida’s area of drought was as high as 71 percent was February 2013. As bad as this drought is, it’s been even worse. During two weeks in April 2012, 99.96 percent of Florida was in a drought. More than 72 percent of Florida was in a drought between late January and early June 2012. There was also an extended period of drought between December 2010 and July 2011 and between April and August 2007. There were also periods of drought in 2000-01. Florida’s dry season runs from about November through May and can leave Florida prone to drought conditions. If the dry season is drier than usual and the wet season is late to appear, a period of drought can run into summer, said Victor Murphy, climate service program manager for NOAA's National Weather Service-Southern Region. There is a small bit of good news: The return of the rainy season — under way this first week of June — should improve drought conditions. "There have been at least three other instances in the past 10 years when this has occurred," Murphy said. "Not coincidentally, all of these events began in the winter/spring (dry) season, and ended during the summer. This event will be similar. "Since the Florida wet season has returned with a vengeance over the past week, and is forecast to continue over the next few weeks, the amount of Florida in drought two to four weeks from now should be substantially less than what it is today." Gore tied in several weather events to illustrate the effects of climate change. Experts told us that Florida is prone to periodic droughts, but rising temperatures as a result of climate change can make droughts worse. "It’s part of the climate -- part of natural cycles," said David Zierden, the state climatologist for Florida who works at the Florida Climate Center at Florida State University. "Our current drought is no worse or more prolonged than any other drought we go through periodically." This year the Florida Peninsula only received half of its normal rainfall during the dry season, leading to the most active wildfire season since 2011. Temperatures have been rising in Florida -- the statewide average temperature for 26 of the last 27 months have all been warmer than normal, Zierden said. "There is an increasing temperature trend, and warmer temperatures lead to greater evapotranspiration rates, which can exacerbate these periods of drought," Zierden said. (Gore’s spokeswoman pointed to an article by the Union of Concerned Scientists that makes a similar point.) While Gore’s numerical statement about the drought is correct, David Nolan, chair of the University of Miami’s Department of Atmospheric Sciences, cautioned against pointing to any particular weather event as proof of climate change. "I am generally not comfortable with relating any local event, a drought in one place or a flood in another, to global warming," Nolan said. "What matters most is global average temperature, because that drives sea level rise, which eventually will be the biggest problem." Our ruling Gore said "70 percent of Florida is in drought today." Gore correctly cited the United States Drought Monitor which showed that 71.66 percent of Florida was experiencing a drought for the week ending May 30. However, that drought percentage isn’t unheard of in Florida -- there have been other periods of drought since 2000 when the monitor began mapping drought data. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-02944	$6 billion water bond program voters passed in 2011 "has yet to be tapped."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/oct/29/independent-texans/water-board-hasnt-tapped-6-billion-lending-authori/	Meeting Texas’ water demands will cost $231 billion by 2060, Texas’ water plan says. Much of that is maintenance and repair, but new water projects will cost $53 billion, and local governments report they’ll need state help to borrow half of that. Yet the Independent Texans political action committee says Texas hasn’t even started using a $6 billion program voters approved in 2011 to help finance water projects. For that and other reasons, the PAC opposes the $2 billion water fund Proposition 6 that Texans will vote on Nov. 5, 2013, according to its white paper published online Sept. 3, 2013. "Texas voters passed Prop 2 in 2011, with a narrow 1.5% margin," the PAC said. "At the time, voters were assured by Prop 2 supporters ...that the $6B evergreen bonding authority would build critical local water supply projects, create jobs and protect us from drought and wildfire without taxpayer contribution. Yet, the $6B bond program has yet to be tapped. "The same supporters now say we must ‘act in concert’ with the Prop 2 bonding authority by infusing $2B of seed money to make the 2011 program work." As it turns out, it’s correct that the state water board hasn’t started using the permission voters granted in 2011 to borrow $6 billion. But why -- and what does that mean for Prop 6? The Texas Water Development Board, created in 1957 after a decade-long drought that ruined thousands of Texas farmers and ranchers, lends money at low rates to communities for local water and wastewater projects, such as reservoirs and pipelines. The board raises money to offer such loans by selling bonds -- basically, big IOU notes that the state eventually pays off. State lawmakers and voters tell the board how many bonds it can sell. The last two rounds of authorization came in 2001, when voters gave permission for the board to issue $2 billion in bonds, and 2011, when voters approved an "evergreen" lending cap of $6 billion -- as long as the total amount loaned out never exceeds $6 billion, the board can keep lending without coming back for new authorizations. But again, those are limits, not actual dollars. To date, the board has issued $1.6 billion under 2001’s $2 billion authority, spokeswoman Merry Klonower told us by phone. The board has committed to but not closed on another $173,000 in loans, so the board can set up $187,000 more in loans before it starts using the $6 billion lending cap, she said. The board had predicted in 2011 that it would run out of the 2001 authority in one to two years, Klonower said, and chose not to wait until the Legislature’s next meeting in 2013 to ask for more. "You don’t want to get to the end of it and start turning communities away," she said. An Aug. 30, 2011, fact sheet from the board said that of $3.29 billion in loans since 1957, $1 billion had been lent in the past three years. "The TWDB estimates that its existing bond authority will be exhausted within the next one to two years," and Prop 2 would provide needed authority beyond that, it said. In other words, the board never expected to start using the $6 billion authority until about 2013, according to the agency. It was seeking permission to make those loans in the future. Independent Texans’ white paper said the $6 billion authority had not been tapped because it doesn’t provide incentives including low interest rates and deferred payments. The pace at which the board issued loans slowed after 2010, and lack of such incentives was one reason why, Klonower and House Natural Resources Committee director Elizabeth Fazio told us by phone and email. Water board list of loans Nov. 2011-Oct. 2013 Received Oct. 23, 2013, from water board Fazio, who serves as the staff to legislators on the committee, explained by phone that the water board can’t make a loan unless two things happen. First, a city or other local entity has to apply, and second, the state has to have a guarantee that the loan payments can be made even if the local government defaults (which none have in the board’s history). With general obligation bonds for water projects, Fazio said, the state provided this guarantee itself in 2007 and 2009 by designating enough general revenue cash to cover the payments. Once that money is dedicated, the board can also use it to make the loan terms better for local governments. For example, the board can buy down the interest rate or offer to make the first loan payments for the local entity, until its water project is operational and has paying customers. But general revenue to do that hasn’t matched up with the demand for loans, Fazio said. "Where there has been a dedication it has been very limited." Klonower said that when the board was able to offer incentives, the demand for loans "far exceeded the amount of funds available." Incentives aren’t the only factor in communities’ decisions to take on water projects, though, she said; the economy and drought conditions weigh in, too. Proposition 6 is intended to provide a stable source of money for such incentives -- namely, a $2 billion chunk of cash that would be transferred out of the state’s rainy day fund. With that money, the board would provide its own guarantees and incentives instead of counting on general revenue being designated for those purposes, as the Legislature did in 2007 and 2009 but did not during the 2011 budget crunch. If the proposal works as planned, state Rep. Allan Ritter, R-Nederland, who wrote the House legislation, has said it could fund a total of $27 billion in projects over coming decades, because the state could continue lending out money for projects as earlier loans are paid back. Our ruling Independent Texans said that the $6 billion bond program approved by voters in 2011 "has yet to be tapped." That’s correct, but the water board didn’t expect to tap into it for a year or two. The pace of lending has slowed, partly because of the lack of incentives the group mentions, but the board is still making loans. We rate this statement, which lacks these clarifications, as Mostly True.	None	Independent Texans	None	None	None	2013-10-29T16:50:47	2013-09-03	['None']
pomt-12201	"We had the best jobs report in 16 years."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/25/donald-trump/donald-trump-right-us-just-had-best-jobs-report-16/	During a speech before tens of thousands of Boy Scouts at the group’s quadrennial Jamboree, President Donald Trump took a moment to tout his economic achievements as president. "I'll tell you what, we are indeed making America great again," Trump said. "What's going on is incredible. We had the best jobs report in 16 years." Trump, as a candidate, regularly bashed the low unemployment rates under President Barack Obama as making the national jobs picture look better than it actually was. Now he says the economy is surging, and the numbers show it. Does he have a point now? When we checked with the White House, they referred us to a Bloomberg article headlined, "Pickup in Confidence Shows Americans Upbeat on Jobs, Economy." The article notes that "unemployment (is) near a 16-year low." Indeed, today’s unemployment rate -- 4.4 percent -- is tied for the lowest in the past 16 years, going back to June 2001. There were four other months prior to Trump’s presidency that matched today’s rate, and it was slightly lower -- 4.3 percent -- a month earlier, during Trump’s own presidency. Here’s a chart. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com That said, the term "jobs report" refers to a monthly news release by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the unemployment rate is only one of two headline numbers in those reports. The other one is the gain or loss in jobs compared to the previous month’s number. That second number, while solid, is not "the best" in 16 years. According to the June 2017 report, the economy gained 222,000 jobs. That’s the 52nd-best monthly performance out of the 193 months since June 2001. Here’s a chart: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Meanwhile, there are a number of lower-profile statistics in every jobs report. Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, noted that one of these measurements -- the ratio of employed people to the population as a whole -- remains stuck well below its pre-Great Recession highs. Here’s a chart: Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist, said the shrinkage in the number of jobs created per month should be taken with a grain of salt, since the country is approaching full employment. Overall, Burtless said, "employment has kept rising and involuntary unemployment has been falling for about seven years, and that pattern has persisted thus far in the Trump administration." Finally, it’s worth noting, as we always do, that no president can take full credit for the economy’s achievements (or its shortcomings). Many other factors, including the health of the rest of the world economy and changes in demographics and technology, play a role as well. This is especially true for a president just six months into his tenure, following years of improvement under his predecessor. Our ruling Trump said that "we had the best jobs report in 16 years" in the most recent monthly release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate, one of two key figures in the monthly release, is near its 16-year low. But while the other major statistic in the report -- the job-gains figure -- is hardly unprecedented over the same period, experts say that’s not surprising, given where the country is in the current economic cycle.

pomt-04244	"More Tennesseans have hunting and fishing licenses than vote."	false	/tennessee/statements/2012/nov/18/lamar-alexander/lamar-alexander-says-more-tennesseeans-have-huntin/	In what was a busy post-election week for Sen. Lamar Alexander -- holding hearings on the meningitis outbreaks and passing the bipartisan PREEMIE Act to prevent infant mortality -- the office of Tennessee’s senior Republican issued a news release to announce a vote "to support S. 3525, the Sportsmen’s bill." A lot of Tennesseans love to hunt and fish, and the release noted that Alexander supported the bill because it "increases hunting and fishing access to federal lands while reauthorizing several conservation programs." The news release’s headline put it another way: "Keep hunting and fishing without burdensome regulations, while protecting our wetlands and wildlife." Those claims fall into the category of opinion, but the quote provided from Alexander asserted a statement of fact -- and one he’s used before: "More Tennesseans have hunting and fishing licenses than vote." We know hunting and fishing are popular, but, fresh off the 2012 election, we were aware that more than 2.4 million votes were cast in Tennessee on Nov. 6. Given that Tennessee has a population of 6.4 million, that would mean that some one-third of all Tennesseans -- just fewer than half of whom are men -- have hunting and fishing licenses. The senator’s office said it was basing the Tennesseans who vote number on the Nov. 2, 2010, midterm election, in which 1,620,542 votes were cast, because that was the most recent election for which official certified results were available. For the hunting and fishing licenses, Alexander’s office pointed to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services reports from 2004, in which it added 727,525 from the hunting license report of 2003 numbers to the 992,727 from the fishing license report of 2003 numbers to come up with 1,720,252. When we contacted the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, we discovered that hunting and fishing licenses are renewable on a yearly basis. Another key point -- most of the Tennessee licenses are what as known as Type 1: Hunting and Fishing Combo. That allows for fishing and hunting of small game, and TWRA press officer Lee Wilmot said that, for 2012, there had been 373,562 such licenses issued. Those hunting larger game, like deer, purchase a Type 4: Annual Sportsman, and 61,284 have been issued for 2012. Throw in the 32,205 Type 2: Youth licenses, the 18,146 Type 166: Permanent Senior Citizen licenses and Type 167: Resident Annual Senior Citizen licenses and you get to 486,416 hunting and fishing licenses issued in Tennessee for 2012. That number is well short of even the 1,620,542 votes cast in November of 2010 in Tennessee, and it’s even further away from the unofficial, non-certified count of 2,454,470 votes in the recent Nov. 6 election and the 2,599,749 votes cast in the 2008 presidential election in Tennessee. More than 2.4 million voted in the 2004 presidential election. Sen. Alexander reached out to us directly and acknowledged that he should have qualified the quote more carefully to make it clear that he was referring to the number votes cast in the 2010 election. The discrepancy in numbers between actual licenses issued from 2012 and the 2003 numbers shown in that federal report appear to be related to how states are allowed to report to the federal agency. A note on the state site, for instance, says Tennessee issues the dual hunting and fishing "combo" license in part to maximize statistics used to receive federal funding. We did find a more recent U.S. Fish and Wildlife report, from 2012, that looked closely at numbers of sportsmen and outdoor enthusiasts in 2011. It did not list licenses, but instead relied on the U.S. Bureau of Census to help make scientific estimates. In its "Table 4: Anglers and Hunters by Sportsperson’s State of Residence for 2011," the report’s number for Tennessee is 923,000. Again, well short of votes cast by Tennesseans in the 2010 midterm elections, and nowhere close to the number of votes cast in any of the three most recent presidential elections. Our ruling We do not disagree with Sen. Alexander’s point that hunting and fishing remain popular in Tennessee, but his statement that more Tennesseans have hunting and fishing licenses than vote is not supported by the most recent and most reliable numbers. There are more voters in Tennessee than sportsmen, so we rule this statement False.	None	Lamar Alexander	None	None	None	2012-11-18T04:00:00	2012-11-13	['None']

pomt-00351	Says Beto O’Rourke voted "against body armor for Texas sheriffs patrolling the border."	false	/texas/statements/2018/sep/13/texans-are/pac-backing-ted-cruz-falsely-says-beto-orourke-vot/	A super PAC backing the re-election of Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas portrays Democratic nominee Beto O’Rourke, who represents El Paso in the U.S. House, as careless about border security. A TV ad from the Texans Are PAC that we spotted on Austin’s Fox 7 Sept. 12, 2018, associates O’Rourke, who opposes the border-long wall sought by Republicans led by President Donald Trump, with taxpayer-funded benefits for immigrants and "sanctuary cities," a term that usually refers to communities that deter local law officers from asking individuals to share their immigration status. The ad’s narrator follows up the mention of O’Rourke’s support for sanctuary cities by saying, about O’Rourke, "while voting against border armor for Texas sheriffs patrolling the border." The ad also shows these words on screen: "No body armor for Texas sheriffs." A 2014 House vote Fine print below the ad’s mention of sheriffs and body armor helped us start our factual review. It said the claim about denying body armor to border sheriffs ties to an O’Rourke vote in June 2014 on the "Grayson Amendment." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Separately, we noticed, Cruz’s campaign posted a press release in May 2018 mentioning the June 19, 2014, vote on the amendment. In that House-posted vote, O’Rourke was among 62 members (counting 43 Democrats) to vote for the amendment from then-Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Florida, which was rejected by 355 members (including 145 Democrats). Cruz’s release said "O’Rourke voted in favor of a bill that would prevent funding for the Defense Department’s Excess Personal Property Program." The release said the program had provided law enforcement in the El Paso area with more than $9 million in equipment, including 156 units of body armor for the sheriff’s office; 90 night vision units for the local border patrol; helicopters for the city police and border patrol; and other items such as trauma gear, fencing and generators. According to the Defense Logistics Agency, which oversees the program, more than 8,000 federal and state law enforcement agencies participate. "Law enforcement agencies use the equipment in a variety of ways," the agency says. "For instance, four-wheel drive vehicles are used to interrupt drug harvesting, haul away marijuana, patrol streets and conduct surveillance. The 1033 Program also helps with the agencies’ general equipment needs, such as file cabinets, copiers and fax machines that they need but perhaps are unable to afford." Our web search for more information about the roll-call vote cited in the Texans Are ad led us to the text of Grayson’s failed amendment to the Defense Department’s appropriations act. That text forbade expenditures toward aircraft, tanks and weaponry provided from the personal property program to local law enforcement--but it made no mention of body armor. Let’s get specific: Grayson’s amendment said that no funds made available by the act "may be used to transfer aircraft (including unmanned aerial vehicles), armored vehicles, grenade launchers, silencers, toxicological agents (including chemical agents, biological agents, and associated equipment), launch vehicles, guided missiles, ballistic missiles, rockets, torpedoes, bombs, mines, or nuclear weapons (as identified for demilitarization purposes outlined in Department of Defense Manual 4160.28) through the" personal property program. Via the C-SPAN video archive, we watched Grayson present his proposal, which he said would restrict the Defense Department from militarizing community police agencies. Military weapons, he said, "have no place in our streets regardless of who may be deploying them." Two Republican members spoke in opposition before Grayson’s proposal was rejected. "We welcome this equipment; it’s not misused," Rep. Rodney Frelilnghuysen, R-N.J., said. Texans Are leader notes another House vote After we’d scoured the cited amendment, Jason Johnson, who runs the PAC, told us by email that the proposed restriction indeed extended to denying body armor to border sheriffs. He didn’t say how. After we published this fact-check, we learned from the DLA that it stopped providing body armor to local jurisdictions years before the O'Rourke vote on Grayson's amendment. Spokeswoman Michelle McCaskill advised by email that the program "stopped providing body armor in 2008. When DLA Disposition Services receives excess body armor from the military services, it is destroyed. What we do provide," McCaskill wrote, "are tactical vests but without the body armor inserted in them. Law enforcement can purchase body armor with their own funds or with federal grant money." Earlier, Johnson also told us that in June 2014, O’Rourke voted against an amendment to the 2016 Defense Authorization Act successfully offered by Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, "that included border security activities on the list of preferred applications the Defense Department should consider when transferring excess property to other federal agencies." We turned to the Congressional Record transcript of that debate to learn that for the purposes of border security, McCaul’s amendment placed the Department of Homeland Security on equal footing with other law-enforcement agencies in access to Defense Department excess equipment. The transcript shows that neither the amendment nor House floor debate touched on body armor for border sheriffs. O’Rourke spoke in opposition to McCaul's amendment, it further shows, by saying DHS already had access to such equipment which, he said, wasn’t needed on the border anyway. O’Rourke said we "do not need to militarize the border" and he said the amendment creates "further anxiety and fear about the border at a time that is not warranted," according to the transcript. The transcript shows O’Rourke ultimately requested a record (rather than voice) vote on the amendment. In that roll call vote, O’Rourke was among 162 Democrats and four Republicans voting "no" while McCaul was among 235 Republicans plus 18 Democrats voting "aye." Our ruling Texans Are said O’Rourke voted against providing body armor to Texas sheriffs patrolling the border. In 2014, O’Rourke voted in favor of barring the Defense Department from providing excess aircraft, tanks and military weaponry to local law agencies in general. However, the proposed restriction did not extend to body armor and made no mention of border sheriffs. Contrary to the ad's claim, there was no up-or-down vote on providing body armor to Texas sheriffs patrolling the border. We rate this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

UPDATE, 10:07 a.m., Sept. 21, 2018: We revised this story to add the DLA's advisory that it had stopped providing body armor to local law enforcement agencies years before the House vote singled out by Texans Are. This addition didn't affect our rating of the claim.	None	Texans Are	None	None	None	2018-09-13T16:55:44	2018-09-12	['Texas']
pomt-04210	"If you and I fail to defund ObamaCare now, some 16,000 new IRS agents will be begin prying into our private medical records, eyeing each and every one of our treatments and prescriptions for "violations’."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2012/dec/02/association-mature-american-citizens/association-mature-american-citizens-says-under-af/	One of the main themes that drives the opposition to President Obama’s health-care overhaul is the idea of the federal government muscling its way into individuals’ private health decisions. One of the favored images in those arguments is the specter of 16,000 newly hired agents from the Internal Revenue Service sweeping in to enforce the law’s rules and regulations. It was evoked in a letter one of our readers received last month from Daniel C. Weber, president and founder of the Association of Mature American Citizens, which calls itself "the conservative alternative to the AARP." Our reader forwarded the letter to us. In his letter, Weber called for signatures on a petition to "defund" the Affordable Care Act, nicknamed Obamacare, and asked recipients to pay for a membership in his group ($16 per year, with discounts for multi-year memberships.) Among other things, Weber claimed that if the law is fully implemented, the federal government will hire 16,000 new IRS agents who "will begin prying into our private medical records, eyeing each and every one of our treatments and prescriptions for ‘violations.’ " We left e-mail and telephone messages for Weber with his organization, but weren’t able to reach him for comment. Politifact reporters and others around the country have been playing Whac-a-Mole with variations of this claim for a while now. PolitiFact National gave then-Illinois Republican U.S. Rep. (and later to be U.S. Sen.) Mark Kirk a Mostly Falseruling for saying in a March 21, 2010, speech on the House floor that the IRS would have to hire 16,000 employees "to audit the American people and impose the new taxes and mandates of the bill." PolitiFact National traced the origin of that number to a report from the Congressional Budget Office that said that, based on what it called incomplete estimates, the new law could wind up costing the IRS between $5 billion and $10 billion over the next 10 years. Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee took the high end of that incomplete estimate, $10 billion, divided it by the average IRS employee’s salary and came up with 16,500 additional "examiners, auditors and other employees." But the committee also noted it was "impossible to know" the exact number of new hires. PolitiFact rated the claim Mostly False because it incorrectly attributed the 16,500-employee figure directly to the CBO, took only the high end of an incomplete estimate and assumed all the money would go to staff and not for other costs, such as office overhead. A year later, U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga, added some new touches to the claim. In a March 28, 2011, letter he sent to a constituent, the 16,500 IRS employees became 16,500 agents enforcing the law. PolitiFact Georgia ruled his claim False. Despite two years of similar debunkings, the 16,000-agent claim not only survives, it’s morphing, as evidenced by Weber’s letter. In addition to repeating the number, he says the new agents will be investigating citizens’ private medical records. Is that true? In short, no. Here are the facts. The law requires individuals who don’t have health insurance to pay a financial penalty. The IRS envisions taxpayers getting a form from their insurance provider that certifies they have coverage, and then attaching that form to their federal tax return. If the taxpayer doesn’t have coverage, the IRS will be responsible for collecting any penalties. How that collection is to be enforced is unclear because the law strips the agency of the ability to impose criminal and civil penalties, such as liens on property. As far as Weber’s claim that the IRS would be investigating taxpayer’s medical procedures, Commissioner Douglas H. Shulman has said the agency’s only interest is in the yes-or-no question of whether a taxpayer has coverage, not what procedures, if any, it covered. "We expect to get a simple form that we won’t look behind that says this person has acceptable health coverage," Shulman told a House Ways and Means subcommittee on March 25, 2010. "There are not going to be any discussions about health coverage with an IRS employee." "The role of the IRS is going to be, again, the tax portions of this," he said, "not the health portions of this." Our Ruling Dan Weber, president of the Association of Mature American Citizens, said in a widely circulated letter that under the federal health overhaul, 16,000 new IRS agents will be "prying into our private medical records." Weber’s letter recycled arguments that have been repeatedly found to be untrue -- and added a new and equally untrue element. Pants on Fire.

pomt-07993	"Martin Luther King Jr. was a Republican!"	false	/texas/statements/2011/jan/17/raging-elephants/houston-group-says-martin-luther-king-jr-was-repub/	Raging Elephants, a Houston-based group involved in unsuccessful efforts to stop GOP state Rep. Joe Straus from winning another turn as Texas House speaker, says on its website that it's dedicated to bringing more "Americans of color" to the ranks of conservative voters. Posted on the site is a video of a speech by the group's leader, Apostle Claver Kamau-Imani, titled "Apostle Claver tells the world how the real party of racism is the Democrats." Also on the site, the group claims: "Martin Luther King Jr. was a Republican!" We weren't aware that the late civil rights leader ever expressed a partisan affiliation. Yet, we discovered, Republican groups have previously declared King one of their own. In 2006, the Sarasota, Fla.-based National Black Republican Association ran radio ads in Washington, D.C.; Georgia; Maryland; Ohio; and Pennsylvania including the statement that King was a Republican, according to an Oct. 19, 2006, Washington Post news story. And in 2008, according to news reports, the same group — whose website says it "is dedicated to promoting the traditional values of the black community, which are in concert with the core Republican Party philosophy of strong families, personal responsibility, quality education and equal opportunities for all" — paid for eight billboards bearing that message in Florida and South Carolina, as well as 50 billboards in Denver during the Democratic National Convention, where Barack Obama became the party's presidential nominee. In July 2009, Raging Elephants made the same claim on a Houston billboard, according to a July 14, 2009, news article on the Fox News Channel's website and a July 9, 2009, column in the Houston Chronicle. Kamau-Imani told FoxNews.com that the purpose of the billboard was to get blacks to rethink their political affiliation; African Americans typically vote for Democrats. "We think it's imperative that (the GOP) try and attract more people from the communities of color to vote their values — to vote conservative," Kamau-Imani told FoxNews.com. The King message has drawn objections. In Houston, the Fox News story says, local activist Quanell X held a news conference to speak out against the sign. Earlier, an Associated Press news article about the billboards posted in Florida reported that the chairman of the Florida Legislative Black Caucus, Democratic state Rep. Joe Gibbons, called the statement ridiculous. "To make a claim without presenting proof is bogus," he is quoted as saying in the July 4, 2008, story. Frances Rice, chairwoman of the National Black Republican Association, was quoted by the Post in 2006 as saying that the backlash from the radio ads was so great that she stopped answering telephone calls. But she stood by the claim that King was a Republican. "We were all Republicans in those days," she told the Post. "The Democrats were training fire hoses on us, siccing dogs on us." The Post story says it's correct that Southern Democrats "blocked the social and political progress of black Southerners for decades." When we asked Raging Elephants for information to support its claim that King himself was a Republican, Kamau-Imani pointed us to a video made by the National Black Republican Association featuring one of King's nieces, Alveda King, founder of the faith-based group King for America. In the Sept. 14, 2008, video, she says: "I just want to share with you a little bit about my family and my history. My uncle Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. during his lifetime was a Republican, as was my father, his brother, Rev. A. D. King, and my grandfather, Dr. Martin Luther King Sr." She adds: "The Republican Party historically has supported the rights of the oppressed. During the times of slavery, many of the abolitionists were Republicans." Our attempts to contact Alveda King were unsuccessful. Next, we sought historical expertise, including by asking Thomas Jackson, a history professor at the University of North Carolina-Greensboro and author of From Civil Rights to Human Rights: Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Struggle for Economic Justice, for his take on the video. He told us that Alveda King's description of the Republican Party's history was on the mark. "The Party of (Abraham) Lincoln defended black rights most vocally in the 1860s and 1870s, then abandoned the cause when the Democrats and the (Ku Klux) Klan defeated Republican state governments in the South. Blacks started their historic switch to the Democrats during the New Deal," which were economic programs implemented in the 1930s under President Franklin Roosevelt in response to the Great Depression. But Jackson said that he would not consider King a Republican, calling him instead a " 'tax and spend' democratic socialist." "He wanted the nation to spend billions of dollars directly to employ the unemployed when the private sector failed, and a vigorous mixture of affirmative action and anti-poverty programs championed by the liberal-left, and targeted federal spending in impoverished areas, especially the nation's slums," Jackson said. David Garrow — author of Bearing the Cross: Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which won the 1987 Pulitzer Prize for biography — advised against assigning King to either party. "It's simply incorrect to call Dr. King a Republican," Garrow told us. However, he said he wouldn't call King a Democrat, either, because he had "very positive feelings" about Republican Richard Nixon in the late 1950s and "extremely positive feelings" about Republican Nelson Rockefeller, the New York governor who later served as vice president. Also, Garrow said, King became "a very harsh critic" of Democratic President Lyndon Johnson over his escalation of the Vietnam War and "wouldn't necessarily have backed (Democratic presidential nominee) Hubert Humphrey in '68 had he (King) lived." We asked Garrow about the 2006 Post article's statements that King had voted for Democratic presidential candidates John F. Kennedy in 1960 and Lyndon Johnson in 1964. He said there is little doubt that King did so. But that doesn't mean King made public his political preferences. In his book, Garrow writes that during the 1960 race between Kennedy and Republican Richard Nixon, King declined to endorse either nominee — even after Kennedy associates interceded with officials in Georgia to help secure King's release from jail on a probation violation. The closest King came to that was a few days before the election when he released a statement that said: "I want to make it palpably clear that I am deeply grateful to Senator Kennedy for the genuine concern he expressed. ... (He) exhibited moral courage of a high order." King's father, however, was so grateful to Kennedy that he announced he was shifting his traditionally Republican presidential preference to vote for Kennedy, according to Garrow's book. King was more vocal about the candidates in the 1964 presidential election, when Johnson faced GOP nominee Barry Goldwater, who as an Arizona senator had voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Garrow told us that King "certainly did all but explicitly endorse LBJ in '64 and strongly criticize the Goldwater candidacy." Garrow writes in Bearing the Cross that King urged his supporters to vote against Goldwater and all GOP candidates who did not disassociate from him. According to the King Online Encyclopedia, from Stanford University's Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute, King campaigned for Johnson and welcomed his win. Next, we wondered what the King Center in Atlanta, founded by King's wife, the late Coretta Scott King, had to say about his partisanship. In 2008, Steve Klein, the center's communications director, told the National Journal that "there is absolutely no confirmation that (King) was a Republican. ... He was never a member of any political party — and never formally endorsed any candidates." Klein noted Coretta Scott King's recall of a 1960 phone call from Kennedy when her husband was in jail. In her book, My Life With Martin Luther King, Jr., she wrote that she took the call but was later unsure what to say about it. "My husband had a policy of not endorsing presidential candidates," her book says. "And at this point, I did not want to get him or myself identified with either party." The 2008 AP story about the Florida and South Carolina billboards included a statement from King's son, Martin Luther King III: "It is disingenuous to imply that my father was a Republican. He never endorsed any presidential candidate, and there is certainly no evidence that he ever even voted for a Republican. It is even more outrageous to suggest that he would support the Republican Party of today, which has spent so much time and effort trying to suppress African American votes in Florida and many other states." Friends and associates of Martin Luther King Jr. also objected. The AP article says that the Rev. Joseph Lowery, who co-founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference with King, "said there is no reason why anyone would think King was a Republican." Lowery told the AP that King almost certainly voted for Kennedy and that the only time he openly talked about politics was when he criticized Goldwater in 1964. The story quotes Lowery as saying: "That was not the Martin I know, and I don't think they can substantiate that by any shape, form or fashion. It's purely propaganda and poppycock. ... Even if he was, he would have nothing to do with what the Republican Party stands for today." Finally, we checked with political experts in the states where King spent most of his adulthood. Charles Bullock, a political science professor at the University of Georgia, said King "didn't die a Republican." But Bullock speculated that King could have been Republican in his youth when Southern Democrats were intensely segregationist. William Stewart, a political scientist at the University of Alabama, said that if King was a Republican, he kept it a secret. King focused on civil rights, Stewart said, and "partisan politics wasn't relevant." Upshot: Raging Elephants points to a King family member whose declaration lends support for its claim that King was a Republican: his niece Alveda. We didn't divine how she reached that conclusion. Another King relative, his son, disagrees, as do respected academic experts and former King associates and friends. The record shows that as a civil rights leader, King avoided partisan identification. We rate the statement False.

pomt-07938	"Of the top five cities for staged automobile accidents, three are in Florida. … We rank No. 1 in the country in staged auto accidents."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/jan/27/jeff-atwater/Florida-tops-staged-auto-accidents-Jeff-Atwater/	At the AP Legislative Planning Session on Jan. 19, 2011, Florida’s chief financial officer lobbed a claim about auto insurance shenanigans. "Of the top five cities for staged automobile accidents, three are in Florida. … We rank No. 1 in the country in staged auto accidents," Jeff Atwater said. We have long known that Florida is special, the reluctant recipient of certain superlatives. These two claims seemed almost too good to be true, but were they? We decided to delve in. Atwater made the remarks less than a week after the topic of fabricating car crashes for cash grabbed several headlines, including a front-page story in the Jan. 16 edition of the Miami Herald. A story earlier in the week chronicled the arrest of five people in Miami-Dade and a sixth in Naples. They were charged with faking car accidents after police say they hired people to stage wrecks or file false claims with insurance companies using drivers’ personal injury protection insurance policies. All told, the scammers billed insurance companies up to $170,000 for medical treatment that was never performed, according to the Florida Division of Insurance Fraud. The issue of fraud related to personal injury protection, or PIP, insurance has been of interest to Atwater. His office issued a press release reporting that PIP-related fraud costs the average Florida family as much as $400 a year. Four Florida cities are among the top 10 in PIP fraud – Hialeah, Tampa, Orlando and, yes, Miami. The Herald reported that more than 400 people were charged in the past two years with PIP fraud. And so, Atwater vowed to keep a spotlight on PIP fraud. "The thieves committing these scams need to know that it’s my plan to put them behind bars," said Atwater, a Republican from North Palm Beach. It was only a few days later that Atwater talked about the fraud cases in Florida at the AP meeting. According to spokeswoman Alexis Lambert, his statements were based on a May 10, 2010, report from the National Insurance Crime Bureau, an Illinois not-for-profit that teams up with various insurers and law enforcement agencies in an effort to prosecute insurance criminals. The study showed that reports of "staged accident questionable claims" spiked 46 percent from 2007 through 2009. The top five states that generated the most "staged accident QCs," or questionable claims, were: (1) Florida, 3,006; (2) New York, 1,680; (3) California, 1,619; (4) Texas, 792; and (5) Illinois, 433. The five cities that saw the "most staged accident QCs" were: (1) New York, 1,304; (2) Tampa, 562; (3) Miami, 511 (4) Orlando, 422; and (5) Houston, 376. These revelations don’t come as a surprise to observers. "I think it’s a generality that Florida ranks well up there," said James Quiggle, a spokesman for the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud, a Washington, D.C., anti-fraud watchdog. "I don’t think anyone who sees the national picture will dispute that." According to a 2007-2008 report from the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud, Florida led the nation in 2005 in the recovery of insurance fraud-related losses through court-ordered restitution. These court findings suggest Florida has ranked high across the board. Despite his intention to put a spotlight on auto insurance fraud, Atwater fails to note that the numbers are for "questionable claims." These, according to National Insurance Crime Bureau spokesman Frank Scafidi, are not the same as actual staged accidents. An analogy might be the difference between a charge and a conviction. The terms may often be used interchangeably, but law enforcement personnel and attorneys certainly know the difference. "We stress to people to keep in mind that these are initial referrals and not definitive acts of fraud, although most of these will certainly be fraud," Scafidi wrote in an e-mail message. Scafidi elaborated. In 2009, NICB reports that there were 85,201 questionable claims submitted and just 4,802 of that number were related to staged accidents. In an average year, he notes, more than 48 million claims are filed by the Insurance Services Office, a company that maintains claims data. That said, only 0.17 percent of the claims were deemed suspicious or questionable, and only about one in 20 of those involved questions of staged accidents. The sample is not enough to draw conclusions on, Scafidi added, but, "It is a useful tool for analysis and for us to see where the potential fraud hot spots are." Atwater is mostly correct about the high numbers of auto fraud cases coming from Florida, but he neglects to mention that the numbers he referred to are "questionable claims," not yet confirmed as actual staged accidents. It’s an important detail. For omitting that clarification, we rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Jeff Atwater	None	None	None	2011-01-27T11:48:40	2011-01-19	['None']
pomt-00872	A "majority of our students are trapped in" underperforming schools.	false	/texas/statements/2015/mar/12/george-p-bush/george-p-bush-says-majority-our-students-trapped-u/	George P. Bush, the first-year Texas land commissioner, maintains that most students are stuck in bad schools. Bush, addressing a "school choice" rally outside the Texas Capitol Jan. 30, 2015, said: "I believe that most teachers are doing the very best in very difficult situations when a majority of our students are trapped in schools that are underperforming. Some schools don’t work and refuse to change — and that’s why we need school choice and that’s why we need it now." The Rev. Charles Johnson, executive director of Pastors for Texas Children, which describes itself as an independent ministry and outreach group supporting quality public education opportunities for Texas children, asked us to check Bush’s statement, which Johnson said he heard about from someone who watched the rally. We were curious too. Asked where Bush’s data came from, Brittany Eck, a General Land Office spokeswoman, pointed out a comment by the state’s chief education official in October 2013, when Texas received a waiver from the federal Adequate Yearly Progress requirement that more than 90 percent of students in each school and district pass the state’s standardized tests in reading and math, in accord with the No Child Left Behind Act that passed into law when George W. Bush was president. At the time Texas got its waiver, Eck said by email, the state’s education commissioner, Michael Williams, said 95 percent of the state’s school districts would not have met the federal law’s expectations, according to an October 2013 news story in the Dallas Morning News. Eck noted the same judgment was aired by a non-governmental group, the Texas Classroom Teachers Association. Meantime, Eck wrote, only 28 percent to 41 percent of Texas fourth- and eighth-graders chosen to take the National Assessment of Educational Progress, sometimes called the nation’s report card, met "proficiency" levels in math or reading in 2013. Some perspective: According to the 2013 results, 62 percent to 84 percent of the Texas students scored well enough to meet basic expectations or better. State accountability ratings Next, we asked the Texas Education Agency what it considers the best measurement of schools in Texas. Spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe said by email the state’s own accountability system is the only rating system in place. And according to the latest state summary of the ratings, released in December 2014, 949 of the state’s 1,025 school districts, 93 percent, "met standard" while 76 districts were rated "improvement required." The summary said 6,723, or 86 percent, of the state’s individual schools "met standard" with 142 meeting an alternate standard — leaving 636 campuses rated "improvement required," meaning the campus missed the state’s standard on one or more performance indicators, according to the TEA. Those indicators include student results on the State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readiness (STAAR) and graduation and annual dropout rates, according to the TEA’s Accountability Manual. For 2014, the summary said, some 484 campuses weren’t rated and one school had "data integrity issues." (We did not consider charter schools to carve out these counts; there aren’t a lot of them.) Overall in the year, Ratcliffe said, 372,287 of the state’s 5,151,925 public-school students, 7 percent, were enrolled in schools that received the "improvement required" rating. Ratcliffe did not dispute that Williams had said 95 percent of the state’s districts would not have cleared the AYP hurdles. The waived expectation under the federal law was that more than 90 percent of students in each school and district pass the state’s standardized tests in reading and math. "We do fall short of perfection," Ratcliffe said. Texas Classroom Teachers Association Given that Eck singled out the classroom teachers association, we asked that group, which advocates for teachers, to assess Bush’s statement. By email, Holly Eaton focused on doubts about the usefulness of the AYP standards, which she said have long been regarded as not attainable at the law’s stipulated pace, explaining why many states (more than 40, the News story said) got waivers, she said. "Accordingly, the projection that 95% of Texas schools would have failed to meet AYP in 2014 shows that Texas was in the same predicament as every other state in the country due to a poorly conceived and widely discredited federal standard," Eaton said. By phone, she elaborated: "We don’t think the federal AYP ratings are of any significance." Broadly, Eaton said, the association disagrees with Bush’s characterization. Other perspectives We also reached out to other close observers of Texas schools. Lori Taylor, a Texas A&M University associate professor in the Bush School of Government and Public Service, commented by email: "I think the term ‘underperforming’ is really squishy. If one has exceedingly high standards for education, then every school is always underperforming." Taylor pointed out the state’s 2014 accountability ratings — and called AYP an "odd standard of performance" because of the law’s everyone-must-pass requirement for a school to be considered acceptable. "Most researchers are highly critical of AYP as a measure of performance, so schools that are performing badly by this measure are not necessarily underperforming as most folks understand the term," Taylor wrote. Also by email, Torey Tipton of Children at Risk, which analyzes test results and other indicators in its own way, said many Texas children are in failing schools. In spring 2014, she said, 2,275, or 30 percent, of more than 7,000 schools ranked by the group landed Children at Risk grades of D, needing "significant improvement," or F, which the group defines as "highly concerning." Our ruling Bush said the "majority of our students are trapped in" underperforming schools. Bush relied on another official’s speculation about how well schools might meet disputed federal standards that don’t apply to Texas this year anyway. Meantime, 2014 state ratings indicate more than nine in 10 districts fulfilled state-set standards and more than eight in 10 campuses did so. We rate this claim False.

pomt-05581	Says she "created the first felony deferred prosecution program for nonviolent first-offenders" in Texas.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/apr/03/rosemary-lehmberg/travis-da-rosemary-lehmberg-says-she-created-state/	In an online video, Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who seeks re-election this year, says she has instituted reforms since she took office in 2009. "My office is the most progressive DA’s office in the state," she says. "I’ve created the first felony deferred prosecution program for nonviolent first-offenders, and it gives them a chance to stay out of the system with a clean record." Vince Leibowitz, a campaign consultant for Charlie Baird, who is challenging Lehmberg in the May Democratic primary, questioned Lehmberg’s statement that her program was the first of its kind in the state and asked us to fact-check it. The Travis County program, which Lehmberg announced in May 2010, gives people who have committed certain felony offenses an opportunity to avoid being prosecuted for a crime by agreeing to meet certain conditions for a period of time. A March 23, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news article on the program points out that since the 1990s, people with drug addictions and no previous convictions for violent offenses could escape certain felony charges by completing the county’s drug court program, which requires a year of intensive treatment, drug testing and court appearances aimed at ending addictions. Lehmberg told us in a telephone interview that she started the felony deferred prosecution program to provide the same second-chance opportunity for nonviolent, first-time felony offenders who are not addicts. "Sort of a parallel track," she said. The program is for people with no prior record who made a mistake and want to make it right, she said. If they complete the program, the charges are dismissed. Applicants must be facing third-degree or state jail felony charges such as theft, forgery, credit card abuse, tampering with a governmental record, and evading arrest, according to the program’s web page. Through their attorneys, clients apply using a form posted online that asks for basic information, including the defendant’s school and work history, an account of the crime and information about previous contact with the criminal justice system. The application is screened by lawyers in Lehmberg’s office, who typically make the decision on whether to accept an applicant. Offenders accepted into the program sign a form pleading guilty and enter into a written agreement with the office laying out the terms they must meet for a set time, up to two years, including not being re-arrested. Other possible conditions of participation are community service, counseling and paying restitution. While people are in the program, their cases are tracked by state District Judge Mike Lynch. The deferred prosecution program, also called a pretrial diversion program, started in September 2010. The Statesman article said that through March 12, 2012, 131 people had been accepted, with 26 having completed the program and eight having been discharged without finishing. So, is the program the first of its kind in the state? During our research, several prosecutors and experts told us that generally, prosecutors don’t have to develop a formal program like Lehmberg’s to practice "deferred prosecution." That’s because local prosecutors have long been free to decide not to proceed with a case. A common example: Dismissing the charges against a young adult in exchange for his or her joining the military. Such case-by-case arrangements are a form of deferred prosecution, Williamson County District Attorney John Bradley told us in a telephone interview. But typically, when someone is talking about a deferred prosecution program, he said, there are more formalized elements that have been put in place such as a list of qualifications and a screening process. Bradley, who has been a prosecutor since 1989, said he didn’t know whether Travis County was the first in the state to offer such a program for certain felony offenders. Most Texas deferred prosecution programs focus on misdemeanors, he said. "It is unusual and rare at the felony level to have a deferred prosecution program," he said. Unlike counties such as Dallas and Bexar where the district attorney prosecutes both felonies and misdemeanors, Travis has a separate elected official, the county attorney, whose office handles misdemeanor cases. And that office had a diversion program long before Lehmberg launched her version, according to Lehmberg and the Statesman article. Lehmberg told us that it’s "pretty common" for prosecutors at both the felony and misdemeanor level to offer deferred prosecutions on a case-by-case basis. Narrowing the claim she aired in the video, Lehmberg said she is not aware of any other formalized non-drug-court deferred prosecution program for felony offenders that has an "application and acceptance process" like Travis County’s. She told us that before making her campaign video, she checked with some other Texas prosecutors and Robert Kepple, executive director of the Texas District and County Attorneys Association, to determine whether another program like hers had been started. She found none. Kepple told us that the association did not know of any other program like Travis’ but that he had not researched the question specifically. Yet, we later learned of two programs that while not identical to the one in Travis County, appear to have similar goals and share some of its processes. One, in the East Texas county of Nacogdoches, started the same year as Travis County’s, in 2010. The other, in the South Texas county of Cameron, began about five years earlier. We were alerted to the Nacogdoches program by an email sent from Austin lawyer Oscar Buitron in response to the Statesman article. Like Travis County, Nacogdoches has a district attorney who handles felony cases and a county attorney in charge of misdemeanor cases. We were unable to reach District Attorney Nicole LoStracco but found a May 1, 2010, news article reporting that she was starting a pretrial diversion program. We also talked with Nacogdoches defense attorney John Heath Jr. who said he has had many clients in LoStracco’s program. The 2010 article, in the Nacogdoches Daily Sentinel, quoted LoStracco as saying that under the program, first-time felony offenders who meet certain qualifications could avoid a permanent red flag on their record. She said her program would be for people who realize that they made a mistake, are repentant, and are willing to learn from the mistake and move on. The article said LoStracco’s office had put in place "guidelines" for the program, including that first-time felony offenders who aren’t likely to commit another offense will be considered. The article also said that defense lawyers must approach the district attorney’s office to apply for the program and that candidates would be required to fill out an application. Participants would also have to write a confession and pay any owed restitution up front, according to the article. Ultimately, LoStracco told the Daily Sentinel, she will decide who qualifies for the program and is "the only one in the DA’s office that can authorize someone to be put on the program." The article said those in the Nacogdoches pretrial diversion program would be monitored by the local probation department. Conditions of the program could include community service, alcohol or drug testing, or counseling, the article said. On June 1, 2011, the Daily Sentinel wrote a news article reporting that in the year since the program’s start, 37 felony offenders had been placed into the program, with only two having been removed for failing to meet the conditions. Heath Jr., the defense attorney, told us that upon completion of the program, participants have the charges against them dismissed. We learned about the Cameron County program from a 2005 news article on the Brownsville Herald’s website that was sent to us by Tobin Lefler, director of Cameron County’s adult probation department. Armando Villalobos, the county’s top prosecutor, handles both felonies and misdemeanors. That means the county’s pretrial diversion program, which Villalobos began in 2005, is open to both misdemeanor and felony offenders. The Dec. 27, 2005, article says that Villalobos, of late a U.S. House candidate, launched the program to give eligible defendants a chance to avoid criminal records that could ruin their careers. In a telephone interview, Villalobos told us that "a lot of felonies" go through his program. A spokesman for his office said it did not have statistics on how many there have been. After examining the Travis County program’s web page, Villalobos said his program was similar. "We don’t have anything as formal as a written application," he said. "We have criteria, and we have forms they fill out if they are going to participate in the program." First-time offenders who committed nonviolent crimes and did not resist law enforcement are eligible, according to documents Villalobos’ office shared with us. Villalobos told us that defense attorneys usually send a letter requesting that their clients be considered for the program. Prosecutors then review the request. Participants must meet conditions to stay in the program and agree to confess to their crime. As in Nacogdoches County, participants in Cameron County’s program are supervised by the local probation department. They also must pay a $500 fee to Villalobos’ office. People who complete the program have the charges against them dismissed, Villalobos said. Lehmberg, presented with our research, said she thought the Nacogdoches program was more similar to hers than the one in Cameron County, which also includes misdemeanors. She said there are some significant differences between the Travis County program and the others, highlighting the involvement of the local probation department in Cameron and Nacogdoches counties. She said the Travis program is geared toward people who don’t need that level of supervision. However, Lehmberg acknowledged that the programs have the same outcomes for successful participants: dismissal of charges upon completion. "As far as being the first," Lehmberg said, "the Nacogdoches program appears similar to mine. If she went first, so be it. I just didn’t know" that. Our ruling Lehmberg said the program she started in 2010 was the state’s first felony deferred prosecution program for nonviolent first-offenders. We found two similar, though not identical, programs in other counties. One was implemented the same year as Travis’, the other five years earlier. Since neither program shares all of the elements of Travis County’s, her claim retains an element of truth. But Travis County was not first. We rate Lehmberg’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-06394	"We are the poster child for compliance, and whenever we discover possible infractions we resolve and report it to the NCAA no matter how minor the violations."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/oct/31/e-gordon-gee/ohio-state-university-president-e-gordon-gee-says-/	Wearing a bow tie instead of shoulder pads, Ohio State University President E. Gordon Gee was nonetheless playing defense for the scarlet and gray on Oct 4. A day earlier, OSU Athletics Director Gene Smith sat three football players against Nebraska for accepting too much money for too little work at summer jobs. It was the latest NCAA infraction in a string for Ohio State dating back to December 2010 that had now encompassed summer jobs, cash handed out a charity event and the infamous tattoos-for-trinkets scandal. In all, 12 scholarship football players had been punished for infractions, former head coach Jim Tressel had been fired and a long-time program booster had been exiled. After his annual talk to faculty members, Gee told the Columbus Dispatch that the school’s athletics compliance office — the folks in charge of discovering, reporting and preventing NCAA violations — was a model for other schools to follow. "We are the poster child for compliance, and whenever we discover possible infractions we resolve and report it to the NCAA no matter how minor the violations," Gee said. "That’s what we have done here." PolitiFact Ohio normally sticks to checking the statements of Ohio’s leading political figures, but it’s not much of a stretch to view Gee as a political figure of sorts. (Gov. John Kasich has referred to him as Ohio’s greatest politician.) So we decided to buckle up our helmet and dig into whether Ohio State’s compliance office really is the "poster child" for universities across the country. First, we reached out to OSU spokesman Jim Lynch to see what he could provide to back up the notion that OSU really has the finest athletics compliance department in the nation. Lynch pointed out that the NCAA had not found major violations in any of the cases and has told OSU officials it does not see a lack of institutional control. (That’s NCAA-speak for a systematic problem.) Lynch referred PolitiFact to OSU’s official responses to the charges, which stress that Ohio State’s compliance office has at all times faithfully reported violations once they were discovered. Lynch further suggested that we speak with Chuck Smrt, a former NCAA enforcement staff official whom Ohio State has hired as part of a consulting team to help with its NCAA troubles. Although Smrt is being paid by Ohio State and far from an unbiased source, we decided to hear him out as a well-regarded national expert in the field. Smrt, a principal with the Compliance Group, said he thinks OSU’s compliance program is one of the tops in the country. "I don’t think I could ever say that any one school is the best, but I think OSU is in the top five in the country," Smrt said. Smrt said he hasn’t looked at all aspects of OSU’s athletic compliance, but the portions he’s reviewed left him with the impression that OSU has a top-notch compliance department. Smrt also said there were areas he had found where Ohio State could improve its compliance department but declined to say what they were. Other experts in athletics compliance were less glowing, but did give OSU’s office good marks. Rick Allen, a former compliance officer for two decades with Illinois and Oklahoma State who sometimes consults on compliance issues with universities, said Ohio State’s department does have a good reputation. "I’ve long had respect for their compliance office, but whether I’d go so far as to call it a model compliance department, I’d hesitate to do that because I think there are a lot of good ones across the country," Allen said. Allen said that a high number of violations may show a lack of rules education. "If you’re a school that is reporting a lot of violations, you may have good monitoring procedures, but maybe you need to beef up your rules education a little bit," he said. In fact, OSU Athletics Director Smith blamed inadequate rules education for contributing to the suspensions of six players for selling awards for discounts on tattoos. "We were not as explicit with our student-athlete education as we should have been in the 2007-08 and 2008-09 academic years regarding the sale of apparel, awards and gifts issued by the athletics department," Smith is quoted as saying in a Dec. 23, 2010 release from the NCAA. Dave Ridpath, an Ohio University professor who worked in the athletics compliance offices for Marshall University and Weber State, said Gee’s comment is an overstatement made for public relations reasons. "I’m not going to say he’s completely off his rocker, but it’s a statement he should probably never make," said Ridpath. Ridpath said Ohio State has a "strong" compliance department, but said it’s "an impossible situation" for schools with highly profitable football teams to have a model compliance department. "Any school that is at a major level, I don’t think any of them could say they have a model compliance department," Ridpath said. "At schools operating on an Ohio State or SEC level, the most important thing at those schools is winning games, player-eligibility and revenue generation, so compliance is never something pushed to the forefront." Beyond the opinions of experts, we reviewed internal audits of the compliance department dating back to 2006 and done in accordance with NCAA rules. Those records show that each year, OSU’s internal auditors found multiple practices in the compliance department that needed improvement. In fact, some of the weaknesses identified by internal auditors were in the same areas where NCAA infractions were later committed by OSU players. For example, a November 2010 audit found that OSU wasn’t keeping an inventory of awards given to players. The selling of awards by players was the central issue in the tattoos-for-trinkets scandal. While there is no evidence that the compliance department knew of any violations by the players, the same cannot be said for Ohio State’s most famous employee: Tressel. In March 2011, Ohio State discovered three email strings from a local attorney to Tressel from April and June 2010 informing the coach about players selling awards for discounts on tattoos from a tattoo parlor owner being investigated on federal drug charges. Although he knew that would have made the players ineligible, Tressel never reported what he had learned in the emails to OSU officials. Ohio State has said that is why they fired the popular coach. Meanwhile, a 2007 audit found that the compliance department wasn’t keeping earning statements of any athletes from part-time jobs and that only 40 percent of the time were employers filling out monitoring paperwork on what jobs athletes were doing. In early October, the overpayment of athletes for part-time jobs was what caused three players to miss the Nebraska game. Two of the audits also cite continuing problems with athletes not properly registering the cars they were driving with the compliance office — first in 2006 and again in 2010. Amid the ongoing issues, the university is considering taking compliance away from the athletics department and creating a university-wide compliance department to better improve compliance, according to news reports. "We believe we have very sound processes and protocols. Many of them have been validated by third parties as being at or near the best in class," OSU Trustee Robert Schottenstein told The Lantern, Ohio State’s student newspaper, for a story. "Still, as I said, we believe we can get better." So what’s our score here? We haven’t found any experts — including one employed by OSU as a consultant — who describe the university as a poster child for compliance. The experts we interviewed think the compliance department is fairly strong, but not a model for other schools to follow. Ohio State itself has acknowledged it didn’t properly educate football players several years ago on whether they could sell the awards they were given. And internal audits of athletic compliance departments in recent years show weaknesses cropping up each year, including several areas that have blown up into public infractions for football players during the past year. Additionally, OSU trustees are considering moving the compliance department outside of athletics to improve the program. In fairness, Gee’s statement was focused on reporting and resolving violations, not necessarily preventing them, even though that’s also the compliance department’s job. And there is no evidence that the compliance office has failed to properly report infractions to the NCAA or cover up anything that has come to light. The NCAA has said it doesn’t see anything that points to a systematic problem in athletics in the recent infractions. However, the actions of Coach Tressel, a prominent figure with major responsibility in the athletics department, constitute a critical failure in reporting violations -- a failure that cost him his job. So OSU isn’t exactly "the poster child for compliance," but we’ll give Gee some points for accuracy in describing the university’s commitment to reporting violations. We’ll have to throw a flag for hyperbole, though, and rate the statement Half True.	None	E. Gordon Gee	None	None	None	2011-10-31T06:00:00	2011-10-04	['None']
pomt-09173	"We have SAT scores lower than that of Alabama."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/jun/04/john-oxendine/sat-scores/	In a video on his campaign Web site, gubernatorial candidate John Oxendine makes the case that Georgia's education system has serious problems. His evidence: Our students are doing worse than those in ... Alabama. This is what he said: "As a parent of four children, three of them in school, I’m very concerned about our education system. We have SAT scores lower than that of Alabama, yet a dropout rate that’s higher. We need to make some serious changes in how we address education.” Georgia? Even worse than Alabama? Ouch. But is it true? For this item, we'll examine whether he is correct about Alabama beating Georgia in SAT scores. A later item will deal with his claim on dropout rates. Oxendine's campaign pointed us to the National Center for Education Statistics, which collects and publishes data for the U.S. Department of Education. Sure enough, Alabama's mean SAT scores for 2009 are higher than Georgia's in all categories: critical reading, mathematics and writing. And the gap is large. Alabama's writing score is 549, 70 points above Georgia's. Its mathematics score beats Georgia's by 61; critical reading by 67. But when we took a closer look at the numbers, we found that Oxendine's interpretation of Georgia's SAT scores is not as clear-cut as it seems. Only a small percentage of Alabama's students take the SAT compared with a much larger percentage in Georgia. For that reason and others, the College Board, the group that administers the SAT, strongly cautions against doing state comparisons. "Not all students in a high school, school district or state take the SAT. Since the population of test-takers is self-selected, using aggregate SAT scores to compare or evaluate schools, districts, states or other educational units is not valid, and the College Board strongly discourages such uses,” the College Board said in a statement to PolitiFact Georgia. This warning and others like it are repeated on the College Board's Web pages, in its statewide reports, plus in its guidelines for interpreting scores. When fewer students take the test, as in Alabama, the numbers get skewed because the test-takers are more likely to be the top students who are applying to the most selective schools. The introduction to each one of the College Board's state profile reports puts it this way: "The most significant factor to consider in interpreting SAT scores for any group, or subgroup, of test-takers is the proportion of students taking the test. For example, if state data are being considered, it is appropriate to recognize that in some states there are lower participation rates. Typically, test-takers in these states have strong academic backgrounds and apply to the nation's most selective colleges and scholarship programs. For these states, it is expected that the SAT mean scores reported for students will be higher than the national average." In Georgia during the 2008-2009 school year, 71 percent took the SAT. In Alabama, it was 7 percent. And indeed, Alabama's scores walloped Georgia's. To get a different view of how the states compared, we decided to look at scores for the ACT, the college entrance exam that is more widely used in Alabama. According to 2009 figures, 76 percent of Alabama high school graduates took the ACTs, with an average composite score of 20.3. In Georgia, 40 percent took the test and scored an average of 20.6. So on the ACT, Georgia beat Alabama. And we got the same kids-don't-try-this-at-home warning from the ACT we got from the College Board: It's not smart to compare the scores of two states. We took these facts to the Oxendine campaign, which said our examination misses its overall point that Georgia needs to make education a higher priority. Plus, the campaign argued, people such as business owners who look at Georgia's SAT scores will see them and worry that this state doesn't have a labor pool that is strong enough for its needs. Whether Georgia needs to make education a higher priority is a matter of opinion. But we think people who hear his claim will wonder whether Georgia indeed has lower SAT scores than its neighbor. He's technically correct, but his claim ignores some important caveats. With so few students in Alabama taking the test, the results can be skewed and paint a misleading picture. Indeed, the ACT shows Georgia ahead of Alabama. So we find his claim Half True.	None	John Oxendine	None	None	None	2010-06-04T20:23:04	2010-06-03	['Alabama']
pomt-13903	Says "Paul Ryan shut off the C-SPAN cameras when the Democrats started their sit-in."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2016/jun/27/stephen-colbert/stephen-colbert-wrong-paul-ryan-killed-house-camer/	It was June 22, 2016. House Democrats had staged a sit-in on the floor of the House to try to force a vote on gun-control legislation. The House, in response, went into recess and the cameras in the House chamber were shut off. It may not sound like the makings of a viral late-night joke, but stay tuned. Undaunted, Democrats started transmitting video and images of the sit-in via social media tools such as Periscope, a live video streaming app. The sit-in, which House Speaker Paul Ryan subsequently blasted as a publicity stunt, lasted 26 hours. The Late Show with Stephen Colbert carried a 25-second comedy bit about the event, which began with a pan up the facade of the Ed Sullivan Theater, where the show is taped, followed by a quick cut to Colbert, holding a dog and sitting on a couch with supervising producer and writer Paul Dinello. Both were watching the feed from the House floor on a wall-mounted TV. "Why am I watching Congress on Periscope?" Colbert asks. "That's because Paul Ryan shut off the C-SPAN cameras when the Democrats started their sit-in," Dinello responds. "Really?" Colbert responds. "Wow, what a petty son of a —" Suddenly the picture cuts to a cartoon of Ryan holding two ends of an unplugged power cord and the sign, "Sorry! Technical Difficulties." The crowd inside the Ed Sullivan Theater cackled. But they didn’t have the full story. Did Ryan really shut off the C-SPAN cameras in the House chamber? Facebook posts said yes. Elizabeth Warren tweeted, "@SpeakerRyan shut off the camera so you can't watch. Shameful." The Daily Show said so as well. The real answer is no. Congress' rules for operating the cameras — which Congress controls — call for video transmission to end as soon as the gavel goes down for recess or adjournment. What happened when the protest started Roll Call provided a good timeline of the protest and the reaction of Republicans. The House was in session and cameras were rolling the morning of June 22. Lawmakers were in something called "Morning Hour," which basically allows members to speak to any issue. At about 11:25 a.m., Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., took to the House floor with a group of Democrats and demanded lawmakers vote on gun legislation. Rep. John Larson, D-Conn., spoke next with a similar message. At that point, Larson yielded the floor to Lewis, who said, "Now is the time to find a way to dramatize it, to make it real." Lewis and a number of Democrats then sat down in the House well. At the time, Ryan wasn't at the speaker's rostrum. The presiding officer was Rep. Daniel Webster, R-Fla. Webster, after conferring with House staff, declared a recess. When Webster declared the recess, the cameras in the House went dead. About a half-hour later, around noon, Republicans tried to gavel the House back into session and the cameras came back on. Again, Ryan was not the presiding officer. This time it was Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas. Democrats remained in the well of the House. Poe declared that the House "is currently not in a state of order" and called another recess. The cameras went black again. Fast-forward to shortly after 10 p.m. The House came back into session and the cameras turned on again. This time, Ryan asked Democrats to end the protest. They didn't, and the protest continued as Republicans struggled off and on to conduct some House business into the early morning hours. At 3:13 a.m., they adjourned until Friday, and the cameras were turned off. The key point The main takeaway in all of this is what triggered the camera going on and off. The camera was off because the House was not in session, not because of an order from Ryan. That's been a House standard going back years. This isn't the first time this has happened. During a sit-in eight years ago, cameras were cut for the Republicans when Democrats controlled the House. Minority Leader John Boehner wanted a vote on offshore oil drilling, a motion to adjourn was passed, and the C-SPAN cameras were turned off. The Republicans kept talking anyway. In that case, the lights and the microphones were turned off for a while as well. Yet the Republicans kept talking. As Politico reported, "Democratic aides were furious at the GOP stunt." That protest lasted five hours. But back then, social media and video streaming services weren’t in the palms of every lawmaker’s hand. When the Democrats staged the latest protest, several members were broadcasting on Facebook and Periscope. C-SPAN picked up both feeds and continued to show the events, using the same style and logos they use when they're tapping into the House cameras. We note that, in the sketch, Colbert isn't the person saying, "Paul Ryan shut off the C-SPAN cameras when the Democrats started their sit-in." But just as we make candidates responsible for all the statements in their ads, we have no doubt Colbert approved this message. A CBS spokeswoman, who identified Dinello for us, declined comment on the content of the sketch. Our ruling The Late Show with Stephen Colbert asserted that Ryan "shut off the C-SPAN cameras when the Democrats started their sit-in." Ryan didn't order the cameras shut off in response to the protest. They were turned off because House Republicans declared the House session in recess. That's a standard policy of Congress, even if it was Republicans making the decision. Colbert's bit was funny, but on its factual basis we rate the statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/92344eb8-90bb-4f8f-8538-82fe220e5176	None	Stephen Colbert	None	None	None	2016-06-27T18:00:31	2016-06-23	['Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'C-SPAN', 'Paul_Ryan']

pomt-07295	"The Democrats have already voted to ban our conventional light bulbs ... in favor of dangerous fluorescent light bulbs."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/20/ameripac/conservative-pac-claims-democrats-banned-incandesc/	A fundraising letter making the rounds from a conservative political action committee draws a political line in the sand over light bulbs. "The Democrats have already voted to BAN our conventional lights bulbs (that you and I use even today!) in favor of DANGEROUS fluorescent light bulbs," writes Alan Gottlieb, chairman of AmeriPAC, a political action committee that largely supports conservative Republican candidates. The letter then invites people to read a letter from the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise Action Fund. "By outlawing incandescent lights in favor of compact fluorescent lighting, the environmentalists said the country would reduce energy consumption by $18 billion a year, or save consumers between $80 to $180 on their electric bills per year," the letter states. "The plus for the globalists? They said it would reduce global warming because one of the causes of global warming is...you guessed it...the old fashioned Tom Edison light bulb." The letter seeks contributions and support for S.B. 395, the Better Use of Light Bulbs (BULB) Act, sponsored by Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., which seeks to repeal the light bulb efficiency standards included in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. "Help put an end to governmental interference in our lives! Help put an end to Mr. Obama interfering with free enterprise!" the letter urges, referring to President Barack Obama. We are checking several claims from these light bulb letters, and in this one, we will tackle the central claim that, "Democrats have already voted to ban our conventional lights bulbs (that you and I use even today!) in favor of dangerous fluorescent light bulbs." First off, it's not accurate to pin the law entirely to Democrats. It's true that more Democrats than Republicans voted for the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. But it got a measure of bipartisan support. It passed the House with a 264-163 vote (with 36 Republicans voting in favor). And in the Senate, the vote was 65-27 (with 20 votes in favor from Republicans). And it was signed by Republican President George W. Bush. We also explore the issue of whether fluorescent bulbs release "dangerous" amounts of mercury into the environment in a separate fact-check. But the bigger issue here is the claim that the bill bans incandescent light bulbs. Sec. 321 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 spells out the new standards, essentially requiring that light bulbs be 25 percent more efficient than they are now. Specifically, a 100 watt light bulb is to be replaced with a bulb using no more than 72 watts of electricity while still providing comparable light output. The 75-watt, 60-watt and 40-watt bulbs must be replaced by bulbs using no more than 53, 43 and 29 watts respectively. The law phased in the new requirements: first the replacements for the 100-watt bulbs by Jan. 1, 2012; followed by the lower watt bulbs in ensuing years. The curlicue compact fluorescent bulbs and LED light bulbs easily meet the new efficiency standards. But we couldn't find any language in the law that specifically bans incandescent bulbs. So we asked Ron Arnold of the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise Action Fund to back up the claim that the law "outlaws" incandescent light bulbs. Arnold said the bill is filled with vague and confusing language and that there is a de facto ban because the standards are so stringent that no manufacturers will be able to build incandescent bulbs that meet them. "We believe 'ban' is an accurate term because there is no such thing as what they require," Arnold said. "If it's available, where can I buy it?" he asked. "Why doesn't Home Depot carry them?" Actually, they do, said Randy Moorhead, VP of government affairs at Philips Electronics, one of the three major manufacturers of light bulbs in the U.S. Philips' new EcoVantage bulb, a halogen incandescent light bulb that runs on 72 watts but throws off as much light as a standard 100 watt bulb (and lasts just as long), shipped out to Home Depot in April, he said. Philips also offers a premium bulb that costs more, but lasts three times longer. Both bulbs are more expensive than the current 100 watt incandescent bulbs, but they more than pay for themselves in savings on electricity to power them (more on that in another fact-check). The two other big players in the industry, Osram Sylvania and GE, have also developed new halogen incandescent bulbs that meet the new efficiency standards. But for those, you'll have to head to Lowe's. Moorhead said industry representatives were closely involved in the legislative process to develop the new efficiency standards and would never have supported a ban of incandescent bulbs. The companies, as well as the legislators who drafted the bill, were keenly aware that the new standards could be met through the development of halogen incandescent light bulbs, he said. "You don't have to buy fluorescent bulbs," said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. Jen Stutsman, a spokeswoman for the Department of Energy, said the claims about a ban on incandescent light bulbs are simply wrong. "It doesn't ban a specific type of light bulb," she said. This one is a clear call for us. It's true that the current versions of incandescent light bulbs will be phased out of existence. Compact fluorescent and LED bulbs offer more efficient alternatives, but if incandescent light is your thing, the major light bulb makers have you covered. They have developed and shipped halogen incandescent bulbs that meet the new efficiency standards, so there is no basis in fact to claim they have been banned in favor of fluorescent bulbs. We rule this claim Pants on Fire.	None	AmeriPAC	None	None	None	2011-05-20T14:35:55	2011-05-16	['Democratic_Party_(United_States)']

pomt-11530	"In the rest of the world, there have been 18 school shootings in the last twenty years. In the U.S., there have been 18 school shootings since January 1."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/feb/15/jeff-greenfield/mostly-false-18-us-school-shootings-so-far-2018-an/	Amid the early news reports about a Florida school shooting that left 17 dead on Feb. 14, 2018, longtime network TV journalist and author Jeff Greenfield declared in a tweet: In the rest of the world, there have been 18 school shootings in the last twenty years. In the U.S., there have been 18 school shootings since January 1. It’s a provocative claim that drew more the 130,000 likes on Twitter. Greenfield, a University of Wisconsin-Madison graduate, may be on the right track generally in contrasting how much gun violence there is in America compared to the rest of the world. But as for his specific claim, he leaves a misleading impression with the U.S. part and lacks evidence for the part about the rest of the world. U.S. school shootings On the U.S. part of his claim, Greenfield told us his 18 school shootings in 2018 comes from the Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund, as reported by ABC News. We found that in the immediate aftermath of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Politico, TIME, CNBC and other national media also reported on Everytown’s 18 figure. In addition, the New York Daily News claimed 18 school shootings, listing the same incidents as Everytown, and HuffPost reported 18, too. But there are some major caveats to that figure. Indeed, when we asked Greenfield for information to back up his claim, he noted to us in his email that the Everytown group’s count "conflates very different incidents, from the harmless to the deadly." As PolitiFact National has reported, Everytown, an advocacy group co-founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg that seeks to prevent gun violence, uses a broad definition of school shooting -- that is, any time a firearm discharges a live round inside a school building, or on a school campus or grounds. Its database includes incidents when no one was injured; attempted or completed suicide, with no intent to injure others; and cases when a gun was fired unintentionally, resulting in injury or death. The list also includes incidents on college campuses. As we’ll see, Everytown counts shooting incidents that are dramatically different than what happened in Florida: 2018 U.S. school shootings as counted by Everytown Date Place Details Jan. 3 East Olive Elementary, St. Johns, Mich. Man committed suicide in parking lot. No other injuries. (We found the building was not being used as a school, as East Olive had been shut down more than six months earlier.) Jan. 4 New Start High, Seattle Unidentified shooter fired shots into building. No injuries. Jan. 10 Grayson College, Denison, Texas Student unintentionally fired a bullet from gun legally possessed by an instructor that struck a wall. No injuries. Jan. 10 Coronado Elementary, Sierra Vista, Ariz. Student committed suicide in bathroom. No other injuries. Jan. 10 California State University, San Bernardino Gunshots, most likely fired from off campus, hit a campus building window. No injuries. Jan. 15 Wiley College, Marshall, Texas Shots fired from car in parking lot, with one shot hitting window of residence hall. No injuries. Jan. 20 Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, N.C. One student wounds another student during argument at sorority party. Jan. 22 Italy High, Italy, Texas Student opens fire in cafeteria, wounding one student before firing at another student and missing. Jan. 22 NET Charter High, Gentilly, La. Unknown person fired shots at students standing in parking lot. No injuries from gunshots. Jan. 23 Marshall County High, Benton, Ky. 2 students left dead in mass shooting by student. More than a dozen students injured. Jan. 25 Murphy High, Mobile, Ala. Student fired into the air outside school after argument in school. No injuries. Jan. 26 Dearborn High, Dearborn, Mich. Individual ejected from game for fighting was shot at in parking lot. No injuries. Jan. 31 Lincoln High, Philadelphia Man fatally wounded in fight in parking lot. Feb. 1 Salvador B. Castro Middle, Los Angeles Student unintentionally fires gun in classroom, wounds two students. Feb. 5 Oxon Hill High, Oxon Hill, Md. Student wounded in parking lot during apparent robbery. Feb. 5 Harmony Learning K-12, Maplewood, Minn. Student pressed trigger on school liaison officer’s gun. No injuries. Feb. 8 Metropolitan High, New York, N.Y. Student fired gun into floor in classroom. No injuries. Feb. 14 Stoneman Douglas High, Parkland, Fla. Ex-student allegedly commits mass shooting; 17 deaths. So, there are 18 incidents in which a gun was fired inside a school or on school property. Three -- Italy, Texas, Kentucky and Florida -- were mass shootings. But of the other shootings: Nine involved no deaths and no gunshot injuries. Two were suicides, with no other injuries (including the one at the closed school). Three were unintentional (although one caused injuries). Rest of the world As PolitiFact National has noted, mass shootings do happen in other countries. But they do not happen with the same frequency as in the United States. Two researchers -- Jaclyn Schildkraut of the State University of New York in Oswego and H. Jaymi Elsass of Texas State University -- analyzed mass shootings in 11 countries, covering the period from 2000-14. Aside from the United States, they looked at Australia, Canada, China, England, Finland, France, Germany, Mexico, Norway and Switzerland. The United States had more mass shootings -- and more people cumulatively killed or injured -- than the other 10 nations combined, according to their research. While part of this is because the United States has a much bigger population than all but China, the difference can’t be explained by skewed population numbers alone. But as for the other part of Greenfield’s claim -- that there have been only 18 school shootings in the rest of the world over the past 20 years -- Greenfield told us he couldn’t recall the source of that information, adding, "yes, I cop to insufficient research." Mark Bryant, executive director of the Gun Violence Archive (which the New York Times uses to track school shooting data), told us the 18-shootings figure could be correct in terms of how many mass shootings occur in schools outside of the United States that get widespread news coverage. But Bryant said there is no way to know -- based on the definition of school shootings that Greenfield relies on -- how many such shootings occur around the globe. About 24 hours after posting the tweet, Greenfield took it down. Our rating In the wake of a Florida school shooting that left 17 people dead, Greenfield said: "In the rest of the world, there have been 18 school shootings in the last twenty years. In the U.S., there have been 18 school shootings since January 1." By one count widely cited in the news media, there have been 18 incidents in which shots were fired inside or outside of a school or university building in the United States so far in 2018. But only three involved a mass shooting. And the count includes two suicides, three accidental shootings and nine incidents in which there were no fatalities or injuries. As for the rest of the world, Greenfield had no evidence to back up that part of his claim. And an expert relied on by the New York Times for gun violence statistics told us there is no way to know how many school shootings -- using the definition Greenfield relies on -- have occurred outside of the United States over the past 20 years. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Jeff Greenfield	None	None	None	2018-02-15T17:49:19	2018-02-14	['United_States']
pomt-02760	"The Earth is not warming."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2013/dec/13/barry-smitherman/scientific-consensus-remains-planet-warming/	Barry Smitherman sees the planet as not warming. Smitherman, a candidate for Texas attorney general, responded to Republican activist Donna Garner in a Nov. 17, 2013, email: "Donna, I have been battling this global warming hoax for 6 years now. The earth is not warming…" A day later, Garner included his comment in an email blast to recipients including reporters. That claim by Smitherman, who also chairs the Texas Railroad Commission, contradicts the latest word from the international body that regularly sifts scientific findings related to climate. An October 2013 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report intended for policymakers states: "Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen, and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased." Candidate's backup We were curious how Smitherman reached his conclusion. His campaign consultant, Allen Blakemore, emailed us web links to about a dozen articles essentially saying that the planet has not been warming as fast as predicted of late or is, in fact, cooling. A Jan. 27, 2012, Wall Street Journal opinion piece, signed by 16 scientists, said there was no need for countries to take drastic steps against greenhouse gases. A secondary theme of the piece was that planetary warming had been smaller than predicted for more than a decade. Similarly, a Sept. 8, 2013, news story in the Telegraph, a British newspaper, said: "Despite the original forecasts, major climate research centres now accept that there has been a ‘pause’ in global warming since 1997." The story quoted two U.S. professors, Judith Curry of the Georgia Institute of Technology and Anastasios Tsonis of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, as saying the planet appears headed into a cooling period. A Forbes magazine article by Peter Ferrara, published May 31, 2012, said "natural climate cycles have already turned from warming to cooling, global temperatures have already been declining for more than 10 years, and global temperatures will continue to decline for another two decades or more," a conclusion Ferrara attributed to presentations at a conference on climate change hosted by the libertarian Heartland Institute. By email, Blakemore and Jared Craighead, Smitherman’s campaign manager, urged us to view a video placed on YouTube on June 27, 2012, of a presentation by Don Easterbrook, a professor emeritus of geology at Western Washington University. In it, Easterbrook said that scant temperature changes support his 2000 statement that global warming is over, making the key question only how intense the cooling period will be. Also noted by Blakemore: An Oct. 13, 2012, commentary by David Rose in the Daily Mail, a British publication, which began: "The world stopped getting warmer almost 16 years ago, according to new data released last week. The figures, which have triggered debate among climate scientists, reveal that from the beginning of 1997 until August 2012, there was no discernible rise in aggregate global temperatures. This means that the ‘plateau’ or ‘pause’ in global warming has now lasted for about the same time as the previous period when temperatures rose, 1980 to 1996. Before that, temperatures had been stable or declining for about 40 years." Rose quoted Curry, of Georgia, as saying the data confirmed a pause in global warming. "Climate models are very complex, but they are imperfect and incomplete," Curry said. "Natural variability (the impact of factors such as long-term temperature cycles in the oceans and the output of the sun) has been shown over the past two decades to have a magnitude that dominates the greenhouse warming effect. It is becoming increasingly apparent that our attribution of warming since 1980 and future projections of climate change needs to consider natural internal variability as a factor of fundamental importance," Curry said. Still, and in contrast to Smitherman’s claim, the Daily Mail article closed by referring to global warming as "real, and some of it at least has been caused by the CO2 emitted by fossil fuels. But the evidence is beginning to suggest that it may be happening much slower than the catastrophists have claimed–a conclusion with enormous policy implications." Debate about reconsideration By email, Curry didn’t directly answer whether the globe is warming: "There has been no statistically significant increase in global average surface temperatures for the past 17 years." Per Curry’s point, Michael Tobis, an Austin software engineer whose blog, Planet 3.0, often brushes climate topics, said by email: "There are strong indications that the deep ocean is heating more than anticipated, which would account for some missing warming at the surface… But it's crucial to understand this--the world has not wandered so far from what we expected as to require a deep reconsideration of the consensus" that global warming persists. Tobis continued: "There's no doubt that CO2 is piling up in the atmosphere. There's no doubt that human activity caused it. There's no doubt that CO2 is a major factor in how energy flows through the climate system, and that changing it leads to a changed climate. There's practically no doubt that in the long run the planet will end up substantially warmer than it is. Figuring out how it gets from here to there matters a lot to human beings who live out our brief lives during the adjustment period. And there are some uncertainties there--it turns out transitions are harder to calculate than final outcomes. But nothing we see reduces our confidence in our understanding." Separately, the Texas state climatologist, John Nielsen-Gammon, pointed out by email a National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration chart indicating a steady rise in ocean heat content, meaning temperatures averaged through the depth of the ocean, since the late 1960s. Like Tobis, though, Nielsen-Gammon said temperatures near the ocean surface have risen more slowly in the past 15 years or so "than they had during the previous 35, and it is possible to find time intervals (such as the past five years) in which all weather station and satellite-based global temperature compilations show a declining trend. Overall, the global surface temperature trend is essentially flat since the dramatic and unusual warmth of the 1998 El Niño year. Nielsen-Gammon’s email continued: "Just about everyone, including some of the sources quoted in the articles you listed," meaning the articles noted by Smitherman’s consultant, "believes that the present lack of surface temperature warming is both natural and temporary. Climate model projections have generally been higher than observed temperatures, which depending on your interpretation means that natural variability has temporarily masked some of the warming or that the models have overestimated the amount of non-natural warming. The causes of the discrepancy are the subject of considerable research." Cherry-picking a time period Our own online search led us to a Sept. 10, 2013, commentary by Forbes magazine staff writer Alex Knapp taking Rose to task for focusing too closely on short-term temperature changes. On the suggestion that global warming paused in 1997, Knapp wrote: "Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, ‘All of the top ten warmest years in the record have occurred since the last major El Niño event, in 1998.’ What’s more, according to NOAA, ‘Since 1976, every year including 2012 has had an annual temperature above the long-term average.’ In fact the two warmest years on record are 2005 and 2010, and the years between 2000 and 2010 had higher average temperatures than the years between 1990 and 1999. "To show the continued rise of global average temperatures over the decades, this chart from the World Meteorological Organization helps to make it pretty clear: "These rising temperatures have serious consequences. Rising temperatures melt glaciers on land, including Greenland and Antarctica. As those melts make their way to the oceans, they cause sea levels to rise. And those rising sea levels are real and have been measured. Here’s a chart of sea level rise since the 1880s – you can see the steadily rising trend for yourself. "The bottom line is that, as I wrote last summer, ‘In the end, everything about climate science boils down to one simple fact: all else being equal, increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide in a mixture of gasses will cause the mixture to absorb more heat.’" Knapp closed: "For our planet, that means as more carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere, the warmer the planet will get. Sure, there might be some short term anomalies – one year might be cooler than its preceding year, for instance – but the long term trend remains…" Texas and U.S. climatologists Broadly, the Texas climatologists we reached said Smitherman got it wrong. "The Earth is warming," Nielsen-Gammon said. By email, Katharine Hayhoe, director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University, called Smitherman’s claim incorrect, adding: "First, climate is defined as the average over 20-30 years or more precisely because atmospheric scientists know that short-term natural cycles in the rates at which heat is exchanged between the ocean and atmosphere can lead to variations in global air temperature over shorter time scales." Hayhoe and Tobis each cautioned that cherry-picking start and stop years can lead to factually skewed conclusions about temperature trends."If you cherry-pick short periods of time, you can end up with nearly any result you want," Hayhoe said. "Only by looking at the entire dataset can you see what the truth is." Hayhoe noted, too, that a study accepted for online posting by the Quarterly Journal of the Royal Metereological Society on Nov. 12, 2013, shortly before Smitherman wrote his email, indicates that global temperatures have been underestimated since 1997 because they did not correctly reflect Arctic warming. Hayhoe further said the proper measure of warming extends past ocean or air temperatures alone. She pointed us to a chart posted on the Skeptical Science website, which focuses on touting peer-reviewed science related to climate change and debunking arguments built on incomplete information. The chart indicates that based on data published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres in September 2009, the ocean and earth have been warming for the past 50 years. Curiously, the state commission chaired by Smitherman, which regulates oil and gas exploration, has a section of its website detailing scientific concerns about greenhouse gases and global warming. A source note on that site led us to the U.S. Global Change Research Program, a federal effort launched by Congress in 1990 to coordinate and integrate global change research across 13 government agencies. We then downloaded a draft "climate assessment" report from the program, dated Jan. 11, 2013, including a letter to the American people stating: "Long-term, independent records from weather stations, satellites, ocean buoys, tide gauges, and many other data sources all confirm the fact that our nation, like the rest of the world, is warming, precipitation patterns are changing, sea level is rising, and some types of extreme weather events are increasing," the draft said. Another part of the draft, prepared by the 60-member National Climate Assessment and Development Advisory Committee, said: "Evidence for climate change abounds, from the top of the atmosphere to the depths of the oceans. This evidence has been compiled by scientists and engineers from around the world, using satellites, weather balloons, thermometers, buoys, and other observing systems. The sum total of this evidence tells an unambiguous story: the planet is warming. U.S. average temperature has increased by about 1.5°F since 1895; more than 80% of this increase has occurred since 1980. The most recent decade was the nation’s hottest on record." Previous fact checks From another vantag point, recent fact checks do not support Smitherman’s statement. PolitiFact New Jersey in July 2013 rated as True a claim that every "single month since 1985 has been warmer than the historic average" and that all "12 of the warmest years on record have come in the last 15 years." Those statistics were backed up by data released by NOAA scientists and NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. As for the warmest years on record, NOAA scientists estimate that the last 15 years have included the 14 hottest years and NASA scientists have said that same time period included the 13 hottest years. A month later, though, PolitiFact Rhode Island rated as Half True a claim that global surface temperatures have been flat for 16 years. This held up partly due to the cherry-picked and short timeframe, which swept in 1998, the El Niño year that made surface temperatures exceptionally warm. When you start near an unusually hot year, there's a good chance that subsequent years will be cooler. That fact check considered major climate databases including one from NASA and another from the Hadley Centre of the Met Office, which is the United Kingdom's National Weather Service. It also tapped a tool available at SkepticalScience.com, whose Temperature Trend Calculator page allows users to pick from among several sets of temperature data and pick various timeframes. Hadley showed a .170 degree increase over those 16 years and NASA's numbers showed a .251 rise. Neither increase exceeded what could have happened by chance. Upshot: The global temperatures that were rising so rapidly in the 1970s, ‘80s, and ‘90s appeared to have stalled. In fact, the Met Office had begun referring to the latest 16 years as "the recent pause in warming." Officials there had issued three reports to try to explain the plateau. They stressed that the last decade was still the warmest on record and asserted that temperatures will likely resume their rapid rise soon, although the agency is not offering a timetable. Said physicist Robert Brecha, of the University of Dayton: "There is increasing evidence in the peer-reviewed literature that over the past decade or so more thermal energy is going into the deep ocean, rather than into the atmosphere. This is almost certainly just a temporary, cyclical process. The key point is that additional greenhouse gases trap heat in the earth system, keeping that energy from flowing back out to space," Brecha said. "So if the atmosphere doesn't receive that heat [thereby increasing its temperature] that trapped energy is nevertheless building up." For our part, we rated as Pants on Fire a legislator’s April 2013 claim that science has not shown greenhouse gases to be a problem. To the contrary, scientists have agreed for years that such gases contribute to atmospheric changes driving climatic warming. Naomi Oreskes, then a professor of history at the University of California, San Diego, sent us a chapter of a pending book updating her 2004 look into scientific consensus about climate change. A portion of the chapter said: "Scientists predicted a long time ago that increasing greenhouse gas emissions could change the climate, and now there is overwhelming evidence that it is changing the climate." However, "to say that man-made global warming is underway is not the same as agreeing about what will happen in the future. Much of the continuing debate in the scientific community involves the likely rate of future change." "There are climate scientists who actively do research in the field but disagree with the consensus position," the chapter later says, "but their number is very, very small." We also contacted Oreskes for this article. She passed our inquiry to Richard Somerville, a professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, who emailed us calling Smitherman’s claim "nonsense." Somerville wrote: "It is just plain foolish to focus on short-term distractions in the climate record due to natural variability, while ignoring the long term-trend due to human activities." Somerville described Smitherman’s offered articles as unscientific, adding: "They misrepresent or ignore what climate science has actually discovered(.)" By email, Craighead of Smitherman’s campaign responded by stressing afresh the Easterbook presentation indicating a global cooling period since 1999. Our ruling Smitherman said the Earth is not warming. To the contrary, national, international and Texas climate authorities concur that the planet is warming. They also warn against cherry-picking individual climatic indicators or timeframes to conclude otherwise. That makes sense to us. In the end, this claim strikes us as both unfounded and ridiculous.

CLARIFICATION, 10:36 a.m., Dec. 13, 2013: This story was amended to show that Nielsen-Gammon was referring to a steady rise in ocean heat content, not surface temperatures.

pomt-01209	"Texas had the worst voter participation in the country" in the November 2014 elections.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/nov/25/jason-stanford/democratic-consultant-says-texas-had-nations-lowes/	A Democratic strategist partly attributed his party’s worse-than-expected loss in the Texas governor’s race to low voter turnout. Jason Stanford, a political consultant, researcher and former gubernatorial campaign manager, said in a commentary in the Nov. 17, 2014, Austin American-Statesman that millions of Texans had "slept through the election." In fact, Stanford declared, "Texas had the worst voter participation in the country." The Lone Star State has a reputation for light voter interest, but did it sport the worst turnout in the nation in 2014? It very likely may have, we discovered, but it’s too early to know for sure. Weak track record In recent years, the percentage of Texans turning out to vote in statewide elections was among the lowest in the country. According to a 2013 Texas Civic Health Index report by the Annette Strauss Institute for Civic Life at the University of Texas, Texas ranked last in voter turnout in the 2010 election. Citing U.S. Census Bureau information based on voter surveys every even-numbered year, the report said Texas ranked 48th in turnout in 2012, 47th in 2008 and 49th in 2006. The 2014 survey results are yet to be reported. It’s not just Texas that’s experienced low voter turnout. According to a Nov. 11, 2014, editorial in the New York Times, the November 2014 election saw the smallest share of eligible-to-vote Americans turn out to vote--36.3 percent--since the mid-term election year of 1942. Stanford’s backup Stanford, asked where his numbers came from, directed us to a Nov. 6, 2014, news blog post by the Dallas Observer, an alternative news weekly. Its story, titled "Texas Had the Worst Voter Turnout in the Country, and the Rain in Dallas Didn’t Help," posted data from the Florida-based United States Elections Project, a one-man operation from University of Florida political scientist Michael McDonald that’s reported voter turnout by state since 2000. According to the Elections Project, Texas sustained the nation’s second-lowest turnout rate of 28.5 percent, trailing only Indiana, which landed at 28 percent. In contrast, numbers from the Texas Secretary of State suggest nearly 34 percent turnout in Texas. What explains the difference? McDonald’s project looks at the share of voters eligible to vote, registered or not, as its base, while the state presents the share of registered voters (a smaller group) as its base. By phone, McDonald said many states base announced turnout percentages on the registered voter population because that number is easily accessible and doesn’t require calculations based on estimates by the Census Bureau. On the Elections Project website, McDonald calls turnout rates for registered voters alone "uninformative for comparison purposes" because voter registration practices vary across states (North Dakota, for instance, requires no voter registration). Also, McDonald writes, voter registration rolls include double entries because the records don’t always catch up to voters changing residences and they often list voters who have left the state. Many Americans could vote but don’t bother to register. Al Jazeera America reported on Nov. 5, 2014, that 70 million Americans who qualified to vote did not register for the 2014 election and, hence, were excluded from voter turnout calculations based on the share of registered voters who cast ballots. For his analysis of each state, McDonald said, he reached his turnout estimates by considering the number of votes cast in the statewide race generating the highest participation -- which in Texas was the governor’s race (also the race used by the Texas Secretary of State to calculate turnout, office spokeswoman Alicia Pierce told us by phone). By phone, Observer reporter Stephen Young told us he declared Texas’ voter turnout the nation’s lowest for the year because that appears to hold for the 36 states that had gubernatorial elections, which he said draw more voters in non-presidential election years than balloting in states lacking those marquee races. Indiana (the state with lower turnout than Texas) was among the 14 states lacking a vote for governor. Calculating voter turnout Our research showed there is no universally agreed-upon method of calculating voter turnout. Some groups use a state’s voting-age population to determine turnout; others, like the Elections Project and the Census Bureau, start from adults eligible to vote by estimating and subtracting adults legally ineligible to vote including felons and non-citizens. Others, like many state governments, calculate the portion of registered voters who voted in a given race. In a 2012 survey, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, an independent clearinghouse of elections information, asked each state to report its voting statistics. The EAC compiled the responses and ranked Texas 47th in turnout among voting-age citizens (ahead of West Virginia, Hawaii, New Mexico and Mississippi). A wrinkle to consider when talking turnout is that voters participate in voting for some offices more than others. Of Texas’ 14,025,441 registered voters as of November 2014, about 4.7 million voters participated in the gubernatorial election while about 4.6 million made a choice in the race for U.S. senator (even though it topped the ballot); down the ballot, a little more than 3.7 million votes were cast for one of the Texas Supreme Court seats, according to unofficial results. Historically, the Texas Secretary of State reports the turnout of registered voters and turnout of the voting-age population, though the state has yet to calculate the latter figure for the 2014 elections. The Strauss Institute report was based on census bureau data gathered by a phone survey in which residents were asked questions to determine if they were eligible to vote, then were asked if they’d voted. The report said: "While other ways of measuring voting rates are available, each calculates the ‘eligible’ population—the denominator in the fraction—differently." We asked McDonald precisely how he whittles Census Bureau population estimates down to the estimated number of adults eligible to vote in each state and then how he quickly establishes turnout percentages. By phone, McDonald said: -He begins with the voting-age population and subtracts population estimates for demographics that are ineligible to vote, like felons and non-citizens. -He calculates each state’s number of eligible voters in the months before an election, then uses vote counts reported by the Associated Press after election night and historical data from past elections to call voter turnout before all votes are counted. -He cautions that no turnout numbers will be official until states report total ballots cast to the Election Assistance Commission--probably by late 2015--so for now, the Texas numbers are an estimate. Independent confirmation We sought to compare the Elections Project estimates of voter turnout with other analyses, nearly coming up empty. Officials with groups we queried--the Pew Research Center, the Voter Participation Project, the Election Assistance Commission and the Texas Tribune--said they relied on the project’s figures. By phone, Curtis Gans, who has led the Center for the Study of the American Electorate at American University in Washington, D.C, since at least 1976, told us preliminary data collected by the center for 2014 didn’t conclusively show Texas, which hasn’t yet finished counting ballots, would have the nation’s worst voter turnout. "Texas has been near the bottom for many years, but I’m not sure if it’s at the bottom this year," Gans said. "In any case, it will be near the bottom." He said the center would release its voter turnout data within weeks. He said other states with historically low turnout, like New York and California, also haven’t finished counting ballots. As of Nov. 7, 2014, three days after the elections, the Elections Project said, 31.8 percent of California’s 24,408,163 eligible-to-vote citizens had turned out for the 2014 election, while 28.8 percent of New York’s 13,563,172 had voted. Our ruling Stanford said that in November 2014, "Texas had the worst voter participation in the country." According to the respected Elections Project, Texas appears to have had the lowest voter participation among states with a governor’s race. Among all states, though, Indiana appears to have had lower turnout--and besides, voting statistics aren’t final. We rate Stanford’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-00101	"There have been 44 plans submitted affecting 90 school districts. And the Scott administration has rejected all of them."	false	/vermont/statements/2018/oct/30/christine-hallquist/did-vermonts-governor-reject-every-school-merger-a/	Vermont is now in the final phase of implementing Act 46, a law requiring school boards to consolidate to form larger districts. The mergers are meant to encourage schools to share resources and save money. The state has some of the highest per-pupil costs in the country, and before this reform, it had the smallest ratio of school-board members to students. The process has been contentious, and debate over the mergers has spilled over to the gubernatorial race. Democratic gubernatorial nominee Christine Hallquist has accused Republican Gov. Phil Scott of being heavy-handed in his efforts to contain education spending in his first term. She hammered that theme home earlier this month, accusing the Scott administration of rejecting all alternative governance proposals for districts that have refused to merge. "There have been 44 plans submitted affecting 90 school districts. And the Scott administration has rejected all of them. We would definitely have a more flexible approach," she said at a press conference on October 10 in Burlington. She repeated a version of that claim later that day in a debate with Scott held in Rutland. That made us wonder – did Scott really say no to every district that asked for a reprieve under the consolidation law? We reached out to the Hallquist campaign, which pointed to a report by Vermonters for Schools and Community, which claimed "communities seeking approval for an alternative governance structure had a right to have their good faith effort be given a good faith evaluation. Instead, all were rejected." The Secretary of Education has, as required by the law, submitted a recommended plan to the State Board for unmerged districts. And that’s the plan attacked in the Vermonters for Schools and Community report cited by the Hallquist campaign. But the Scott administration has no power to reject or approve alternative structures. The Vermont State Board of Education has the final say over districts that have not voluntarily merged. Moreover, in multiple instances, Scott's secretary of the Agency of Education agreed with districts which submitted alternative governance proposals that they should retain their current structures. Take Hartland and Weathersfield in the Upper Valley, for instance. The neighboring K-8 districts asked the state to allow them to remain single-town, stand-alone districts. In the agency’s proposed plan, then-interim Secretary Heather Bouchey wrote that while a merger between the two districts was legally possible, it wouldn’t make much sense to consolidate the two since each town had little in common and tuitioned their children to different high schools. "Because there does not appear to be any commitment of the communities to create a new definition of ‘us,’ there is scant likelihood that they will realize the potential opportunities of a larger, more flexible unified structure," Bouchey wrote. In nearly half of all cases, the secretary recommended that the State Board do precisely what districts had asked for in their proposals. So why did the report argue that the alternative proposals were all rejected? The Hallquist campaign said that Margaret MacLean, an education consultant and activist with Vermonters for Schools and Community, was their point person on Act 46. Here’s how MacLean explained, earlier this summer, why the group claims all AGS proposals were rejected: "The secretary recommended forced merger or no action. She recommended zero for approval," she wrote in an email to VTDigger. MacLean’s general argument is that a fair appraisal of AGS proposals by the state would have included a rubric for vetting whether districts had shown they could meet the goals of the law – like cost-efficiency and equity – without merging, and then made recommendations accordingly. While the group is free to argue with how the secretary decided to make her recommendations, it isn’t fair to say the agency "rejected" all alternative proposals. In 21 cases, the secretary agreed with districts who submitted alternative governance proposals asking to keep their governance structures as-is. Our ruling Christine Hallquist accused Gov. Phil Scott of rejecting all alternative governance proposals under Act 46. But that statement was based on misleading rhetoric by anti-merger advocates. And in 21 cases, the Secretary of Education agreed with districts who submitted alternative proposals that they could retain their existing structure, and did not recommend forced mergers to the State Board. We rate this claim as False. Update Following the publication of this fact-check, Christine Hallquist send out a press release retracting her statement, thanking VTDigger reporter Lola Duffort for the article and celebrating the role of the press in political discourse. "I appreciate when the press holds both me and Governor Scott accountable when we make mistakes, as they should. This makes us better and serves the Vermont public," she said. "Governor Scott and his administration have been very heavy handed on public schools, but Duffort is absolutely correct that he did not, as I stated, reject every Act 46 Alternative Governance proposal. I apologize and retract this claim. In this, as in all matters of policy, I am open to new information and new evidence that will serve to better any proposals I put forward."

pomt-09997	"There has been no net global warming for over a decade now."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/apr/01/cato-institute/cato-institutes-claim-global-warming-disputed-most/	A recent full-page newspaper ad from the libertarian Cato Institute takes issue with President Barack Obama's convictions about global warming. The ad cites then-President-elect Obama's Nov. 19 statement: "Few challenges facing America and the world are more urgent than combating climate change. The science is beyond dispute and the facts are clear." "With all due respect, Mr. President, that is not true," the ad states in bold letters. Below that is a statement they say was signed off on by more than 100 named scientists. "We, the undersigned scientists, maintain that the case for alarm regarding climate change is grossly overstated. Surface temperature changes over the past century have been episodic and modest and there has been no net global warming for over a decade now. After controlling for population growth and property values, there has been no increase in damages from severe weather-related events. The computer models forecasting rapid temperature change abjectly fail to explain recent climate behavior. Mr. President, your characterization of the scientific facts regarding climate change and the degree of certainty informing the scientific debate is simply incorrect." Global warming is a complicated subject, and we're not going to flesh it all out here. But we did want to address the underpinning of this ad, the claim that "there has been no net global warming for over a decade now." First off, we should note that while there are some who disagree about the existence of global warming, the overwhelming consensus among scientists who study the climate is that it does, and that humans are worsening it. The definitive statement on global warming comes from a 2007 study by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of scientists from more than 130 nations. They concluded that the "warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice and rising global average sea level." The group also concluded that there is "very high confidence that the global average net effect of human activities since 1750 has been one of warming." The problem with the assertion in the Cato statement is that it is impossible to make meaningful conclusions about climate trends based on looking at a 10-year window, said Richard Heim, a meteorologist at the NOAA National Climatic Data Center Climate Monitoring Branch. People tend to think of global warming as a steady trend upward, Heim said, but that's not how it works. if you were to look at long-term trends, like a century, it looks more like steps. Temperatures wil rise for a few years, then level off or even go down a little bit, then go back up. That's why you've got to look at temperatures over many decades, he said. And if you look at the trends over the last 100 years, Heim said, "the overall linear trend shows clear, unequivocal, unmistakable warming over that period." Take a look for yourself at the NOAA graph of 100 years of global temperatures. Now, over the last dozen years, he said, global temperatures have largely plateaued. That's consistent with the trends. Typically, he said, climates will go up, then plateau until they reach a tipping point, and then rise again. "What you are seeing in the last eight or 10 years is kind of like one of those steps," Heim said. "The fact that it's not getting warmer doesn't mean we are not experiencing global warming. You can't talk about global warming over a 10 year period. The time scale is too short." When you grab short time frames, say 10 years, it's easy to cherry-pick starting points that are particularly high or low to make your argument one way or the other. But even if you did select a 10-year frame — as cited by Cato — it would show a slight warming over time, Heim said. If you looked at just the last eight years, it would look flat. In fact, if you looked at the last four years, it would seem to be cooling. "But this is crazy," Heim said. "You have to look at the big picture." Gavin Schmidt, a NASA climate scientist who was a reviewer on the IPCC study, called the Cato argument that there has been no global warming over the last 10 years "fatuous and false." "What if I said that there had been no global warming for an hour? You would rightly tell me that this was too short a period for it to be meaningful," Schmidt said. "The same is true for a 'decade'. But even so, it is false." Schmidt directed us to a graph showing the 10-year climate trends using the four main temperature indices. The line bounces up and down like a lie detector graph, but the overall lines all trend upward . "To be clear, the globe has warmed for the last decade," Schmidt said. "You can get different results if you pick out your start dates carefully, a practice known as cherry-picking since it is trying to use the data to say something other than what it generally shows, but you are much better off looking at the longest time scales you have (such as these from NASA )." Cato cited a study on the internal variability of the climate system to support its claim. But the paper, from Kyle Swanson and Anastasios Tsonis, doesn't dispute the long-term trend of climate change, Schmidt said. He cited this conclusion from the paper: "If the role of internal variability in the climate system is as large as this analysis would seem to suggest, warming over the 21st century may well be larger than that predicted by the current generation of models, given the propensity of those models to underestimate climate internal variability." Said Schmidt: "Quoting this paper to support a claim that global warming has stopped is like quoting Ronald McDonald in support of vegetarianism." In conclusion, most scientists who study climate say that cherry-picking a 10-year window is inappropriate. But in this case, cherry picking exactly 10 years (Cato said a decade) still doesn't support their claim. We rate this claim False.

pomt-05425	Says Mitt Romney's comments indicated he would not have pursued Osama bin Laden.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/30/barack-obama/obama-ad-says-mitt-romneys-view-killing-bin-laden/	A Web ad from President Barack Obama’s campaign about the death of Osama bin Laden asks, "Which path would Mitt Romney have taken?" The ad features former President Bill Clinton saying Obama "took the harder, and more honorable path," when he approved the May 2, 2011, strike that killed the terrorist mastermind. By contrast, it portrays Romney as less committed to the effort to kill the al-Qaida leader. It says Romney once criticized Obama for "vowing to strike al-Qaida targets inside Pakistan if necessary." Then it shows a clip of CNN’s Wolf Blitzer quoting Romney as saying in April 2007, "It's not worth moving heaven and earth and spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person." By using that quote, the ad indicates that Romney would not have pursued the al-Qaida leader. Indeed, that's how headlines described the April 27, 2012, ad. A conservative blogger pounced on the ad's implication, saying it took Romney’s "heaven and earth" quote out of context. (That charge was also levied back in 2007 about the Associated Press story that quoted Romney in the first place.) Fox News followed, saying "Obama campaign's bin Laden ad omits Romney clarification on key quote." We wondered: Did the ad accurately characterize Romney’s "heaven and earth" quote? Was he really lukewarm — or even opposed — to the effort to get bin Laden? The AP interview There’s no dispute that Romney said about bin Laden, "It's not worth moving heaven and earth and spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person." But was he saying he wouldn’t pursue the terrorist? The quote comes from an Associated Press story on April 26, 2007, about a Romney interview with reporter Liz Sidoti that covered a range of topics. Here’s the related passage: In the interview, Romney also: Said the country would be safer by only "a small percentage" and would see "a very insignificant increase in safety" if al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden was caught because another terrorist would rise to power. "It's not worth moving heaven and earth spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person," Romney said. Instead, he said he supports a broader strategy to defeat the Islamic jihad movement. At the time, Democrats such as Obama were criticizing President George W. Bush for failing to find bin Laden. Republicans, in turn, were critical of Obama's focus on capturing or killing the terrorist leader. A post from the conservative site Townhall.com in 2007 says it got a transcript from Romney’s campaign at the time that shows he followed the "heaven and earth" line with the sentence: "It is worth fashioning and executing an effective strategy to defeat global, violent Jihad and I have a plan for doing that." Later, he explains, "Global jihad … involves millions of people and is going to require a far more comprehensive strategy than a targeted approach for bin Laden or a few of his associates." Sidoti, now AP’s political editor, couldn’t confirm the accuracy of the transcript for us, and Romney’s campaign didn’t respond to our inquiry. Lucky for us, Romney himself had a chance to clarify his words just days after he spoke them, in a May 4, 2007, Republican presidential debate. The moderator of the MSNBC debate, which featured nine Republicans, brought up Romney’s "heaven and earth" quote, which rival Arizona Sen. John McCain had called "naive." MODERATOR: "Gov. Romney, respond to the mentioned reference to you ... by Sen. McCain." ROMNEY: "Thank you. Of course we get Osama bin Laden and track him wherever he has to go, and make sure he pays for the outrage he exacted upon America." MODERATOR: "Can we move heaven and earth to do it?" ROMNEY: "We'll move everything to get him. But I don't want to buy into the Democratic pitch that this is all about one person — Osama bin Laden — because after we get him, there's going to be another and another. This is about Shia and Sunni. This is about Hezbollah and Hamas and al-Qaida and the Muslim Brotherhood. This is a worldwide jihadist effort to try and cause the collapse of all moderate Islamic governments and replace them with a caliphate. "They ultimately want to bring down the United States of America. "This is a global effort we're going to have to lead to overcome this jihadist effort. It's more than Osama bin Laden. "But he is going to pay, and he will die." That suggests Romney was criticizing Democrats for focusing too much on the al-Qaida leader rather than the full organization and would have aggressively pursued bin Laden in the context of a larger antiterror strategy. Still, Romney suggested just a few months later that he wouldn’t do what Obama ultimately did — call for a secret, unilateral Navy SEALs strike inside Pakistan. In 2007, Obama had said that if he were elected president, he would be willing to launch strikes against al-Qaida targets in Pakistan with or without Pakistan’s approval. An Aug. 4, 2007, headline from Reuters — an article cited by Obama’s ad — says, "Romney attacks Obama over Pakistan warning." Romney called Obama's comments ‘ill-timed’ and ‘ill-considered,’" Reuters reported, along with other news services. "There is a war being waged by terrorists of different types and nature across the world," Romney said, according to Reuters. "We want, as a civilized world, to participate with other nations in this civilized effort to help those nations reject the extreme with them." Romney "said U.S. troops ‘shouldn't be sent all over the world.'" Other Republicans (and Democrat Hillary Clinton) had the same complaint, with some going so far as to say Obama "wants to bomb Pakistan," a statement we rated Pants on Fire. The Obama campaign, on the other hand, had issued a memo that the United States had deferred to the Pakistani president’s judgment long enough, and that, "Barack Obama wants to turn the page," Reuters reported. Our ruling An Obama campaign ad suggested Mitt Romney wouldn’t have agressively pursued Osama bin Laden by citing Romney's statement that, "It's not worth moving heaven and earth and spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person." The Obama campaign is right that Romney used those words, but by cherry-picking them, it glosses over comments describing his broader approach. Romney said he wanted to pursue all of al-Qaida, not just its leaders. The reporter quoting him in April 2007 said he instead "endorsed a broader strategy to defeat the Islamic jihad movement." And he said just over a week later that he would "get Osama bin Laden and track him wherever he has to go, and make sure he pays for the outrage he exacted upon America … he is going to pay, and he will die." Still, Romney was clear later that summer that he would prefer to participate with allies rather than take unilateral action to kill terrorists as Obama supported — and later did. The ad takes Romney’s words out of context, but gets part of the story right. We rate it Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-04-30T12:14:58	2012-04-27	['Osama_bin_Laden']
pomt-05937	"Eric Holder is supportive of the NAACP's efforts to get the United Nations involved in our elections."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2012/jan/27/true-vote/true-vote-says-eric-holder-supports-naacp-request-/	Eric Holder, the U.S. attorney general, supports a group’s push for international involvement in U.S. elections, a Texas-rooted organization says. On a web page urging supporters to protest Holder’s Dec. 13, 2011, stop in Austin, True the Vote said Holder "is for NAACP plans to involve the United Nations in U.S. elections. "Are you ready to have U.N. blue helmets outside your polling place?" Not us. While pondering that possibility, we wondered whether True the Vote, a national conservative poll watchers group that grew out of 2008 efforts to monitor Houston polling places, is right about the government’s lead lawyer backing such an endeavor. Catherine Engelbrecht of Richmond, Texas, True the Vote’s leader, told us in a telephone interview that she learned of the NAACP’s interest in enlisting the U.N. from a Dec. 5, 2011, news article posted by a British news source, the Guardian. That story, which makes no mention of Holder, says the NAACP is petitioning the U.N. over what it sees as a concerted effort through changes in election laws to disenfranchise black and Latino voters ahead of the 2012 presidential election. Eric Wrobel, an NAACP spokesman, told us by email that the NAACP held a "Stand for Freedom" march in New York on Dec. 10, 2011, culminating in a rally across the street from the UN. Wrobel pointed us to an NAACP web page promoting the march stating that "it’s time to Stand for Freedom. We must protect our right to vote." A Nov. 8, 2011, press release promoting the event calls Stand for Freedom a voting rights campaign bringing together the NAACP and other groups in "an aggressive nationwide effort to stop changes to state election laws that would suppress the rights of millions of Americans to vote." At issue, the release says, are state efforts reducing early voting opportunities and voting on Sundays plus new mandates in some states that voters present photo IDs before being allowed to cast ballots. In the release, Todd Jealous, president of the NAACP, says: ""We are in the midst of the greatest coordinated legislative attack on voting rights since the dawn of Jim Crow. Voter ID laws are nothing but reincarnated poll taxes and literacy tests, and ex-felon voting bans serve the same purpose today as when they were created in the wake of the 15th Amendment guaranteeing ex-slaves the vote—suppressing voting numbers among people of color." Holder goes unmentioned in the press release -- and also did not mention the NAACP effort in his subsequent Austin speech, which otherwise underscored his interest in protecting minority voting rights. Most immediately, Holder said, the Justice Department was reviewing voter ID laws approved last year in states including Texas and South Carolina. He said the reviews are in keeping with provisions of the Voting Rights Act, which applies to parts of all of 16 states with a history of voter discrimination and requires changes in election laws in the jurisdictions to be pre-cleared by federal judges or the department before taking effect. "If a state passes a new voting law and meets its burden of showing that the law is not discriminatory," Holder said, "we will follow the law and approve the change. And where a state can’t meet this burden, we will object." Ten days later, the department deemed South Carolina’s voter ID law discriminatory because the state’s registered minority voters are nearly 20 percent more likely than whites to lack a state-issued photo ID, according to a news article posted online Dec. 23, 2011 by The Washington Post. "The absolute number of minority citizens whose exercise of the franchise could be adversely affected by the proposed requirements runs into the tens of thousands," Assistant Attorney General Thomas E. Perez said in a letter to South Carolina officials, the Post reported. According to the Post account, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a Republican, called the agency’s decision "outrageous" and said she plans to seek "every possible option to get this terrible, clearly political decision overturned so we can protect the integrity of our electoral process and our 10th Amendment rights." Back to the NAACP: A "Take Action" section of the NAACP’s Stand for Freedom website urges visitors to sign the "Stand for Freedom Pledge" and "protect the right to vote in your community." The pledge calls, in part, for the Justice Department to enforce the Voting Rights Act; for Congress to pass legislation advancing all Americans' right to vote and making it easier for working people to cast their ballot; and for state legislatures and governors to repeal every voter suppression measure and pass and implement measures to increase voter participation. It also calls for the "United Nations to investigate and condemn voter suppression tactics in the United States." And has Holder endorsed the pledge? We found no sign of that in a Nexis search of news articles. In response to our inquiry, Xochitl Hinojosa, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said by email that the agency has not taken a position on the NAACP’s request to the U.N. Separately, Hilary Shelton, the NAACP’s Washington Bureau director and senior vice president for advocacy and policy, told us in a telephone interview that while he attended Holder’s speech and the NAACP has met frequently with Justice Department officials about protecting U.S. voting and civil rights, the group has not brought up its call for U.N. officials to monitor U.S. elections with Holder or the Justice Department: "There has not been a request from the NAACP" for Holder to join the plea for U.N. interest, Shelton said, nor have department officials voiced support. "We don’t see that as a role for" the Justice Department, Shelton said. "So we didn’t ask them... At none of these meetings do I recall the United Nations even being mentioned." Shelton said too that the NAACP has no desire for U.N. troops to occupy U.S polling places, though it would like researchers to gauge whether American citizens are being dissuaded or prevented from voting due to election laws. Ideally, he said, such researchers would occasionally monitor polling sites -- starting as soon as this spring’s party primaries -- in "hot spots" including Texas. Shelton said in a follow-up interview that in 2004, the U.N. monitored presidential balloting in the United States, focusing on Florida. However, according to a July 9, 2004, news article from the Press Trust of India, the U.N. declined to deploy observers after fielding a request from 13 Democratic U.S. House members. The Press Trust article quotes an unidentified U.N. spokesman saying: "The policy and practice is that the United Nations responds to requests made by national governments and not by the legislative branch. Besides, the observation must be mandated by the 191-member (U.N.) General Assembly as the activity also affects the sovereign jurisdiction of that country." Shelton said the U.N. has not yet aired a position on the recently presented pledge, which he said nearly 40,000 people had endorsed as of Jan. 23, 2012. Engelbrecht, informed that neither the DOJ or NAACP had confirmed Holder’s support of the group’s U.N. request, guided us to Virginia lawyer Christian Adams, who quit the Justice Department’s civil rights division in 2009 after voter-intimidation charges were dropped against two African American activists who had stood outside a Philadelphia polling place in November 2008, one of them wielding a baton, according to an Oct. 23, 2010, news article in The Washington Post. In an interview, Adams said U.N. officials have met with DOJ officials; such meetings occurred when he was still working for the government, he said. The U.N. "has spent a good deal of time and effort investigating American elections," Adams said. "That’s a fact." He urged us to ask the Justice Department for confirmation. We asked the Justice Department’s Hinojosa if any part of Adams’ claim was accurate. Hinojosa said by email: "We are unaware of any recent meetings between Justice Department officials and U.N. officials specifically on voting issues." He did not reply to our request to define "recent." Similarly, we asked the U.N. if its officials have been investigating U.S. elections or meeting with Justice Department officials about them. Rupert Colville, spokesman for the Geneva-based U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, replied by email: "I very much doubt it," though he said he couldn’t speak for the entire "big and complex" U.N. system. So, the Justice Department says there have been no recent meetings, while a U.N. spokesman is doubtful. As we completed this review, True the Vote’s Engelbrecht stood by the group’s claim that Holder supports the NAACP's efforts to get the U.N. involved in U.S. elections. Our ruling True the Vote provided no evidence for its Holder claim while our own inquiries landed no confirmation -- nor anything close. Holder and the NAACP both say minority voting rights should be protected. But the idea that Holder backs the group’s call for a U.N. investigation appears to be without basis. Indeed, if this claim was factual, it would be national and international news. Instead, the statement is ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-11486	Says 97 percent of gun owners support universal background checks.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/mar/02/tammy-baldwin/mostly-target-claim-97-percent-gun-owners-support-/	Students planning a national school walkout, angry that more hasn’t been done to protect them from school shootings, might have more support from adults than they realize when it comes to gun control. The walkouts are planned for March 14, 2018, the one-month anniversary of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 people dead. Speaking about Parkland, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who is being challenged by two Republicans in her bid for re-election, made a claim about background checks that might sound extreme. At a WisPolitics event on Feb. 22, 2018, eight days after the shooting, the Wisconsin Democrat said: We know that we need change. And it’s frustrating because there is a high level of consensus across America on the sort of common-sense safety measures that need to be brought up and passed. Among gun owners -- and I'm a gun owner myself -- 97 percent support expanded, universal background checks so we don’t have the gun-show loophole, so that we don’t have the internet purchases that don’t go through a thorough background check. To reiterate, Baldwin’s claim is about support among gun owners, not just the general public, for requiring background checks for all gun sales, not just those done by federally licensed dealers. Prior fact checks Four months before the Florida school shooting, we rated True a claim by Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele that 90 percent of Americans "support universal background checks" for gun purchases. We found a half dozen national polls that showed support at or near 90 percent. And an October 2017 poll taken by Gallup after Abele made his claim found support at 96 percent. But that’s the general public. What about gun owners? Quinnipiac poll To back Baldwin’s claim, her campaign cited a national telephone poll by Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Conn., of 1,249 people who identified themselves as registered voters. The poll, done with live interviews on landlines and cell phones, was taken over four consecutive days, starting Feb. 16, 2018 -- two days after the school shooting in Parkland. The question: "Do you support or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers?" Before we get to the results, there is one wrinkle here: Respondents weren’t asked if they were gun owners themselves; rather, they were asked if they, or anyone in their home, owns a gun. The result was 97 percent support among gun households (as well as 97 percent among all respondents in the poll). The margin of error for the gun households (which made up 555 of the 1,249 total respondents) was plus or minus 5 percentage points. Three polling experts -- Marquette Law School Poll director Charles Franklin, Karlyn Bowman at the American Enterprise Institute and Janine Parry, director of the Arkansas Poll -- told us they were not aware of any other national polls done in recent months that published results about gun owner support of universal background checks. We did find a poll of people who identified themselves as gun owners, by the Pew Research Center, which asked: "Would you strongly favor, somewhat favor, somewhat oppose, or strongly oppose making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks?" The result: 77 percent of gun owners strongly or somewhat favored. But that poll was taken in March 2017, 11 months before the Parkland shooting. It’s tempting to think that support reached 97 percent in the Quinnipiac poll simply because it was taken days after the Parkland shooting. But Quinnipiac’s results have been consistent. For example, support was 94 percent among gun households in Quinnipiac’s December 2017 and November 2017 polls, the most recent ones done before the February 2018 poll. Our rating Baldwin says "97 percent" of gun owners support universal background checks. The figure is correct for the latest national poll, completed days before her claim, that asked about requiring background checks for all gun purchases. The only clarification is that the respondents weren’t all necessarily gun owners, but rather lived in a household where they or someone else own a gun. We rate Baldwin’s statement Mostly True. div class='artembed'>See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Tammy Baldwin	None	None	None	2018-03-02T06:00:00	2018-02-22	['None']
pomt-03875	"The president is advocating a drone strike program in America."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/07/rand-paul/sen-rand-paul-says-obama-advocating-drone-strike-p/	Sen. Rand Paul’s filibuster on March 6, 2013, expanded from the Senate floor to Twitter, where he, among other things, accused President Barack Obama of "advocating a drone strike program in America." The Republican from Kentucky spoke for nearly 13 hours until the early morning on March 7 to keep senators from voting on the nomination of White House counterterrorism chief John Brennan for CIA director. The subject of Paul’s concern: a letter from the attorney general that didn’t appear to rule out drone strikes against U.S. citizens on American soil. "No American should be killed by a drone on American soil without first being charged with a crime, without first being found to be guilty by a court," Paul said. By mid afternoon March 7, the attorney general released a new letter clarifying the administration's stance, Paul declared victory, and the Senate voted to confirm Brennan, 63 to 34. (Paul voted no.) The Senate logjam may have broken, but we still wondered: Has President Barack Obama been "advocating a drone strike program in America"? What the administration says We asked Paul’s office to explain his tweet, but we didn’t hear back. His full Twitter comment said: "The President is advocating a drone strike program in America. All we have to compare it with is the drone strike program overseas." However, during his filibuster, Paul mentioned a March letter from Attorney General Eric Holder as well as testimony from Brennan’s February confirmation hearing. The senator had sought the administration’s views on whether 'the president has the power to authorize lethal force, such as a drone strike, against a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil, and without trial." Armed drones — remote-controlled, pilotless aircraft — are used by the U.S. to kill enemies overseas, with hundreds of strikes in multiple countries in the last decade. Brennan has said, "In this armed conflict, individuals who are part of al-Qaida or its associated forces are legitimate military targets." In at least one case, the target was American. Paul wanted assurance that strikes wouldn’t be made against Americans in the United States. On March 4, Holder responded to Paul, writing that the United States hadn’t carried out such drone strikes and did not intend to. "As a policy matter, moreover, we reject the use of military force where well-established law enforcement authorities in this country provide the best means for incapacitating a terrorist threat," Holder wrote. But, Holder wrote, he could "imagine an extraordinary circumstance in which it would be necessary and appropriate under the Constitution and applicable laws of the United States for the President to authorize the military to use lethal force within the territory of the United States." "For example," he continued, "the President could conceivably have no choice but to authorize the military to use such force if necessary to protect the homeland in the circumstances of a catastrophic attack like the ones suffered on December 7, 1941, and September 11, 2001. "Were such an emergency to arise, I would examine the particular facts and circumstances before advising the President on the scope of his authority." Brennan had offered a similar explanation in response to lawmakers’ questions before his February hearing. A senator had asked, "Could the administration carry out drone strikes inside the United States?" Brennan’s reply: "This administration has not carried out drone strikes inside the United States and has no intention of doing so." (Note that he did not say whether it "could," only that it hadn’t and didn’t intend to.) Asked to describe the "geographical limits" on the administration’s drone strikes, Brennan noted, in part, "the government has a responsibility to protect its citizens from these attacks, and, thus, as the attorney general has noted, ‘neither Congress nor our federal courts has limited the geographic scope of our ability to use force to the current conflict in Afghanistan.’" But he went on to say: "This does not mean, however, that we use military force whenever or wherever we want. International legal principles, such as respect for another nation’s sovereignty, constrain our ability to act unilaterally. Using force in another country is consistent with these international legal principles if conducted, for example, with the consent of the relevant nation – or if or when other governments are unwilling or unable to deal effectively with a threat to the United States." We asked the White House for its response to Paul’s assertion that the president was "advocating a drone strike program in America." "On the record, that claim is false," said Caitlin Hayden, spokesperson for the National Security Council. She also pointed to Brennan’s speeches and nomination testimony, as well as letters by Holder. We reviewed earlier Brennan speeches — such as the one in which he acknowledged the government’s overseas drone program — as well as speeches and news briefings by Obama and his press secretaries Robert Gibbs and Jay Carney. We found nothing to indicate the administration was "advocating" domestic drone strikes. The most direct statements we saw from the administration on the idea of domestic drone strikes came from Brennan’s nomination testimony and Holder’s letters. Holder’s second letter to Paul, the day after his filibuster and tweet, said: "It has come to my attention that you have now asked an additional question: 'Does the President have the authority to use a weaponized drone to kill an American not engaged in combat on American soil?' The answer to that question is no." (Paul declared the statement "a major victory," though it doesn’t address what authority the administration claims against citizens on U.S. soil it deems to be a "legitimate military target.") We also asked eight experts in drone-strike policy and law whether they thought Paul was correct that the Obama administration was "advocating a drone strike program in America." None of them did. "Holder, in his testimony, said that in theory the administration could engage in a targeted killing in the U.S.," said Michael C. Dorf, a Cornell University Law School professor. "But I don't think that counts as ‘advocating’" such a program. Steven Groves, a senior research fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation, agreed, saying it was "probably a stretch to say that the administration is ‘advocating’ a drone strike program in America" when in fact Paul’s most immediate concern was that Holder would not rule out the use of drone strikes against Americans on U.S. soil. The statement, Grove said, "may fairly be characterized as rhetorical flourishes." Paul Pillar, a veteran of the CIA who now teaches at Georgetown University, added that Paul’s statement "does not fairly reflect the extreme and extraordinary nature of the hypothetical circumstance that the attorney general was addressing." Our ruling Rand Paul tweeted that "the president is advocating a drone strike program in America." The attorney general and White House counterterrorism chief haven’t strictly ruled out the use of lethal force against U.S. citizens on American soil, but they said that it would take extraordinary circumstances. We — and all the experts we consulted — see no evidence that the administration is purposefully advancing the goal of a drone strike program in America. We rate Paul’s claim False.

pomt-12818	"Over 39% of violent criminals return to prison following their release."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/feb/10/joe-sanfelippo/joe-sanfelippo-39-percent-violent-criminals-return/	Three state lawmakers from southeastern Wisconsin want to toughen penalties on those who repeatedly commit violent crimes. "We know that habitual offenders are increasingly terrorizing our neighborhoods and preying on innocent victims," state Rep. Joe Sanfelippo (R-West Allis), a co-sponsor of the bill, said in a YouTube video uploaded Feb. 1, 2017. As Sanfelippo spoke, a graphic behind him caught our attention. It claimed that "Over 39% of violent criminals return to prison following their release." Repeat offenders To check the claim, we turned first to an official report on recidivism published by the Wisconsin Department of Corrections in September 2016. It tracks whether inmates are sentenced for a new crime after they are released from prison for an earlier offense. The report shows recidivism trends covering more than 156,000 offenders who were released from the Wisconsin correctional system between 1990 and 2013, Corrections Secretary Jon E. Litscher wrote in an introduction. Quick takeaway: Since the early 1990s, the percentage of inmates who are convicted of a new crime within three years of getting out of prison has fallen steadily. In the category of "violent" criminals, the Department of Corrections looked at those convicted of murder, non-negligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, negligent manslaughter, kidnapping, other sexual assault, simple assault, and other violent offenses including intimidation, illegal abortion, extortion, cruelty toward a child or wife and hit-and-run driving with bodily injury. Violent crimes do not include aggravated burglary or burglary, DOC spokesman Tristan Cook told us. The standards come from the Association of State Correctional Administrators (ASCA) Performance-Based Measures System. For those who committed violent crimes -- the group Sanfelippo is interested in -- 27.2% were considered recidivists, according to the latest state report. So does that mean Sanfelippo is way off target by saying "over 39% return to prison?" Not necessarily. There’s a wrinkle here related to the definition of "recidivism." Under the definition used in the report, recidivism means those who are convicted and sentenced for a new crime. That leaves out a whole category of offenders who return to prison without being convicted of a new crime. Typically they land in prison when their probation, parole or extended supervision is revoked by the state. When you factor in those cases, the rate was 39.7% in the most recent figures, according to the state Department of Corrections. It’s that calculation that Sanfelippo points to in backing up his claim. The state calls that the "reincarceration rate." It’s a commonly used measurement in incarceration research. And Sanfelippo’s phrasing in the video squares with that data. Another factor But there is one issue with his approach. Sanfelippo portrays these repeat violent offenders as "terrorizing our neighborhoods," but many who are sent back due to parole violations and related matters have done something that does not warrant a new criminal charge. Violent offenders are returned quite frequently for technical violations, in part because they are under more stringent supervision due to the serious nature of their offenses, said Thomas LeBel, a criminal justice expert at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. A Journal Sentinel investigation published in 2015 found the process that sends violators back behind bars relies largely on the judgment of individual parole agents, which can vary widely. Among the reincarcerated, more than half were imprisoned when their probation, parole or extended supervision was revoked, with no new conviction and sentencing, Corrections Department statistics show. In those types of cases, there was suspected criminal activity in about 70% of cases involving some 3,000 ex-offenders sent back to prison without being convicted of new crimes in 2015, Corrections Department statistics show. But technical violations are a factor too. They can include things such as accepting a job without permission, missing a meeting with a probation or parole officer, or leaving their home counties, according to a study by WISDOM, a statewide group of faith leaders and activists dedicated to prison reform. Indeed, some can wind up back in prison even if acquitted of charges in court. In February 2017, the Journal Sentinel wrote about Damien Payne, a Milwaukee man on state supervision after release from prison in 2010. Payne was found not guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm and of carrying a concealed weapon, but still was sent to prison for more than three years. A Corrections Department rule allows that action. Our rating Sanfelippo claimed that "over 39% of violent criminals return to prison following their release." The number tracks a credible report by the state, so it’s on target. But it needs clarification because Sanfelippo portrays the repeat offenders as "terrorizing" neighborhoods when some very likely were imprisoned anew for lesser violations. That’s our definition of Mostly True.

pomt-12467	Says John Quincy Adams said, "If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more, and become more, you are a leader."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/05/ivanka-trump/book-john-quincy-adams-quote/	Ivanka Trump’s new book Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success leans on a litany of inspirational quotes to help women balance their lives at home and the office. Featured voices include Walt Disney, Toni Morrison, Betty Friedan, Maya Angelou, Nelson Mandela, Estee Lauder, Sheryl Sandberg and our sixth president, John Quincy Adams. Trump used the following quote about leadership to tee off a passage about leading with purpose from any level: "If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more, and become more, you are a leader." John Quincy Adams Her decision to include this particular quote (page 179) may have been inspired by a 2015 tweet from her father, President Donald J. Trump. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The quote gets good play in leadership circles and memes online. And it looks somewhat legitimate when you Google "John Quincy Adams," appearing as the top quote. To our ears, you are more likely to hear this nugget of wisdom in management training than in the early period of our nation. We reached out to learn more from her publisher but did not hear back. While it’s impossible to prove someone never, ever said something, the quote has all the traces of being fake. The real person who said the quote, or at least a version of it, could be a woman known for celebrating her fake attributes, Dolly Parton. "I've never seen that from J. Q. Adams," said H. W. Brands, a University of Texas at Austin presidential historian and author. "It doesn't sound like him. He wasn't the dreamy type." Brands continued: "Adams had a rather crimped view of human nature. He thought most people were rascals. He disliked democracy because he thought it fostered pandering to people's baser instincts." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Collection of the Massachusetts Historical Society Adams was a prolific writer, in keeping with family tradition. He maintained a diary from 1779 to 1847, spanning more than 15,000 manuscript pages and 51 volumes. No, we did not read them all, nor did we review his complete correspondence and speeches from his time in the revolution and as a lawyer, diplomat, secretary of state, and president from 1825-1829. But we did talk with someone else well-versed in his considerable output: Sara Martin, editor in chief of The Adams Papers of the Massachusetts Historical Society. "I am confident that this is not a JQA quotation," she said. "It neither sounds like him, nor is it really the vein of political thought that he typically expresses in his quotations." She sent us real quotes from Adams relating to leadership to show the difference, backed up with links to his diary entries. (Here’s the whole list.) "But the man who expects that all mankind, or the circle in which he moves will treat him according to his real merits, must have very little experience in the ways of men." Diary entry from Aug. 8, 1787 "All zealots justify unworthy means by the sanctity of the end." Diary entry from Aug. 3, 1788 "A politician in this country must be the man of a party. I would fain be the man of my whole country." Diary entry from Jan. 28, 1802 "The tendency of all private associations to settle into factious cabals is the besetting sin of all elective governments." Diary from entry from Oct. 2, 1844 You get the picture. The most-detailed effort to track down the real source of the leadership quote was Quote Investigator in 2011. The website concluded that the quote likely evolved from a version used by Parton before it was assigned to Adams in its current form. Quote Investigator found that the 1997 book The Most Important Thing I Know quotes the singer and actor as offering, "If your actions create a legacy that inspires others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, then, you are an excellent leader." Our ruling The quotation Ivanka Trump chose, one of many, is a worthy reflection. But it was a silly and easily avoided mistake to assign the words to John Quincy Adams, as others on the internet have done, when there is no record of him saying it. There are a lot of other verified options. We rate this statement False. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com	None	Ivanka Trump	None	None	None	2017-05-05T16:02:18	2017-05-01	['None']
pomt-12794	On leaks and the release of secret information.	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/16/donald-trump/trumps-flip-flop-leaks-and-release-secret-informat/	"Boy, I love reading those WikiLeaks!" -- Nov. 4, 2016 "The spotlight has finally been put on the low-life leakers!" -- Feb. 16, 2017 During the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump couldn’t get enough of the private emails of senior Democrats released by WikiLeaks. "Boy, I love reading those WikiLeaks!" Trump said on Nov. 4 at a rally in Wilmington, Ohio. He also touted the fruits of WikiLeaks disclosures on Oct. 31 in Warren, Mich., on Nov. 2 in Orlando and Pensacola, Fla., and Nov. 6 in Sioux City, Iowa. Trump even called on Russia to locate and release emails by his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. "Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing," he said during a press conference at the Trump National Doral golf course on July 27. But now Trump is assailing leaks from the intelligence community to the New York Times that led to the quick departure of Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Flynn. The articles cited anonymous officials saying that during the presidential transition, Flynn had been in contact with Russia about the sanctions that had recently imposed by the Obama administration. At a Feb. 15 press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump lamented that Flynn -- "a wonderful man" -- had been treated "very, very unfairly" by the media. "Papers are being leaked, things are being leaked," Trump said. "It’s criminal actions ... and it’s been going on for a long time -- before me. But now it’s really going on, and people are trying to cover up for a terrible loss that the Democrats had under Hillary Clinton." He followed up with several tweets between Feb. 14 and 16, such as this one from Feb. 16: "Leaking, and even illegal classified leaking, has been a big problem in Washington for years. Failing @nytimes (and others) must apologize!" And at a press conference the same day, he spent time criticizing leaks. "The press should be ashamed of themselves" for running stories based on leaks, Trump told reporters. So is this a flip-flop? Before we start, we should emphasize that our Flip-O-Meter judges whether someone has been consistent on an issue. The rating is not making a value judgment, but simply noting if a change of position has happened. In this case, there are some differences between the election leaks and the leaks by the intelligence community. However, experts on national security told us that Trump has shown inconsistent standards. We’ll note that Trump doesn’t think it’s a change in position. Pressed on the question at his Feb. 16 news conference, Trump drew a distinction between the release of classified information (the leaks on Flynn and Russia) and the release of personal emails (WikiLeaks and the Democratic National Committee). "In one case, you're talking about highly classified information," Trump said. "In the other case, you're talking about (DNC chairman) John Podesta saying bad things about the boss (Clinton). I will say this: If John Podesta said that about me and he was working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun. He said terrible things about her. But it wasn't classified information. But in one case, you're talking about classified (material)." Trump has a point about the distinction. But that’s not the whole story. Though the DNC releases weren’t classified, Wikileaks has released classified information previously. That includes 750,000 pages of documents stolen by Chelsea Manning, then known as Bradley Manning. In other words, during the campaign Trump praised an organization that made its name by leaking classified information. Now he’s criticizing leaking. "He went from ‘I love WikiLeaks,’ an organization that publishes leaked classified information, to his current position," said Barnett Rubin, associate director of the Center on International Cooperation at New York University. "A few months ago, leaks were getting him elected -- now they are destroying" his presidency, agreed John Pike, director of globalsecurity.org. Robert F. Turner, associate director of the University of Virginia's Center for National Security Law, said he understands the distinction between leaking classified material and information that is merely private. He also made clear that he is almost always dead-set against leaking. Regardless of who makes or broadcasts the leak, "good people die and freedom is placed in jeopardy," he said. However, Turner added that "it seems clear to me that Russia was trying to influence the outcome of our election, which I view as a serious national security issue." If a disgruntled Democratic National Committee official had copied some documents and leaked them, "I think Trump could have drawn a reasonable distinction between those garden variety disclosures of private information (arguably by ‘whistleblowers’) and disclosures derived from classified national security programs that were apparently disclosed by government employees in violation of their security agreements." However, "because of the Russian role I don't think that distinction holds up," Turner said. "Bottom line, I would call this a flip-flop." Other experts emphasized that a hack -- something Trump was on record supporting and even encouraging during the campaign -- is potentially worse than a leak. "Information from a hack carried out by a foreign power with the intention of influencing or discrediting U.S. elections is much more serious than leaks of classified information intended to inform the public or influence policy," Rubin said. Benjamin H. Friedman, a research fellow in security studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, went even further. "Trump has done something worse than flip-flop," he said. "He’s showed that his stance of leaks depends on whether it helps him. Flip-floppers change their mind; Trump has showed that he doesn’t have a stance on leaks independent from his interests. He’s pretending otherwise now, but it’s not credible." Indeed, there’s an example from Trump’s somewhat more distant past that addressed this issue. On Oct. 30, 2013 -- long before Trump was an announced candidate for president -- he tweeted, "ObamaCare is a disaster and Snowden is a spy who should be executed-but if it and he could reveal Obama's records,I might become a major fan." Trump may have been joking in this tweet. Still, it suggests that this dichotomy -- between leaks that help him and leaks that don’t -- has crossed his mind before. Our ruling During the campaign, Trump praised WikiLeaks, an organization that exists to publicize private, and at times classified, information. Now, as president, he’s criticizing federal officials who have leaked secret or classified information to the news media. Trump has a point that the leaked material from the DNC wasn’t classified. Still, the underlying principle is the same: Trump was praising the release of private information during the campaign but criticizing it after he became president. The situations are substantially similar, but Trump’s sentiments are not.

On Treasury's current forecasts, the tax to GDP ratio is predicted to rise in coming years to levels well above the Howard years. However, Fact Check does not consider these forecasts, which will almost certainly be amended due to new policy decisions and changing economic conditions, to undermine Mr Keating's claim.

Measured by total employees, the Woolworths Group — including all of its Australian operations — employs more Australians than the federal public service. On the other hand, Woolworths supermarkets do not. The public service employed 152,095 people at the end of June 2017. This is the figure cited by Mr Leigh, which Fact Check accepts. When it comes to Woolworths, however, the numbers are less clear-cut. It appears the wider group employed around 183,500 people in Australia at the end of June 2017, while its Australian supermarkets currently employ 115,000 people. On that basis it is impossible to assess the data behind his claim. But in any case, experts contacted by Fact Check said the comparison makes little sense because it ignores substantial differences between public servants and retail workers, notably hours worked. They said a better measure would compare full-time equivalent staff, which takes these hours into account. The Commonwealth budget shows that in 2016-17 the federal public service employed 140,911 full-time equivalent staff. Woolworths declined to supply a full-time equivalent count.

pomt-06818	"One in every five families in the state of New Jersey has a loved one with a mental illness, a serious mental illness, and today, we don’t care."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/aug/11/richard-codey/sen-codey-says-1-5-new-jersey-families-has-loved-o/	Gov. Chris Christie’s budget veto pen didn’t just hit big-ticket expenditures. Even small amounts – including $50,000 for a mental health awareness group – was trimmed from the state’s spending plan this summer. And state Sen. Richard Codey (D-Essex) had plenty to say about it during a speech he gave July 11 on the Senate floor in Trenton. "One in every five families in the state of New Jersey has a loved one with a mental illness, a serious mental illness, and today, we don’t care," Codey said in response to Christie’s line-item veto of a $50,000 appropriation for the Governor’s Council on Mental Health Stigma. PolitiFact New Jersey checked Codey’s statistic and found that, depending on definition and methodology, the figure is generally accurate. While several national mental health-affiliated organizations cite that statistic for all states, at least one other said the ratio is 1-in-4 families. "These days our fact sheets are using one in four (families) any day in a given year has a mental health problem," said Bob Carolla, spokesman for the National Alliance on Mental Illness. "It depends on who has done the most recent study and parameters around it." Codey, who was governor from November 2004 to January 2006, signed an executive order in November 2004 to create the Governor’s Task Force on Mental Health to investigate the state’s mental health system. One of the task force’s recommendations was creation of the council, with an aim to educate people about mental illness. "The thing about mental health is it knows no barriers, rich or poor, black or white," Codey told us. Codey raised more than one issue in his statement, so we’ll look at the number of people in New Jersey affected by mental illness, explain the budget cut and identify "serious mental illness." First, New Jersey had 3,152,877 households from 2005 to 2009, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. If each household is considered a family, that means approximately 630,575 New Jerseyans had a mental illness during that time, based on Codey’s statistic. Second, state Treasury Department spokesman Bill Quinn confirmed the $50,000 cut and said the money was used for promotional materials and expenses related to council Executive Director Celina Gray’s outreach efforts about mental illness. Quinn said Gray remains employed and the council still exists, but the work connected with it has been folded into the Human Services Department’s Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services. The governor’s office did not respond to two email requests for comment on Codey’s statement. Codey, Carolla and Phil Lubitz, associate director of NAMI’s state office in North Brunswick, each identified serious mental illness as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, major depression and panic disorder. "Loved ones also applies to immediate family members," Lubitz said. Although Codey’s statement was about New Jersey, the 1-in-5 statistic is used by these organizations: the U.S. Surgeon General’s Office; the American Psychiatric Association; and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. "In 2009, there were an estimated 45.1 million people with any mental illness in the past year -- that’s 19.9 percent of all individuals age 12 and older … or, if you prefer, about 1 in every 5 individuals," Bradford Stone, spokesman for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, said in an email. "For serious mental illness, the rate was 4.8 percent (about 1 in every 20 individuals) or 11.0 million individuals for all individuals age 18 and older." NAMI has used 1 in 4 families since 2007, and the National Institute of Mental Health cites both statistics. "The current prevalence estimate is that about 20 percent of the U.S. population are affected by mental disorders during a given year," according to "Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General," issued in 1999 and still one of the main standards today in assessing mental illness, Carolla said. Let’s review. In responding to a budget cut for a council formed by the Governor’s Task Force on Mental Health, Codey said that one in every five New Jersey families has a loved one with a mental illness. Various reports from at least three organizations cite that statistic, but NAMI cites 1-in-4. Another national organization cites both. Even with the slight disparity, the overall point of Codey’s statement is that mental illness is very common. We rate Codey’s claim True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

abbc-00009	A regularly repeated claim in public debate is that Indigenous Australians were covered by a flora and fauna act, which did not classify them as human beings, and that this only changed when the constitution was amended following the 1967 referendum.	in-the-red	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-20/fact-check-flora-and-fauna-1967-referendum/9550650	Ms Clanton's claim is a myth. Aboriginal people in Australia have never been covered by a flora and fauna act, either under federal or state law. But despite several attempts by various people to set the record straight, the myth continues to circulate, perhaps because, as one academic told Fact Check, it "embodies elements of a deeper truth about discrimination". Although the claim has been repeated more frequently during the past 10 years, there is evidence to suggest the myth originated in the early 1970s. Both an expert consulted by Fact Check and a museum website in Western Australia suggest several factors have given rise to the notion that a flora and fauna act once existed. Also, a widespread and energetic campaign for a yes vote in the 1967 referendum played a crucial role in setting the conditions for the myth to emerge. Experts told Fact Check that the referendum involved "dry" technical amendments to the constitution relating to Indigenous Australians. As these were difficult to explain in a campaign-friendly way, campaigners for a yes vote instead pushed the idea of equal rights and justice for Aboriginal people. The hugely successful referendum was thereby imbued with a symbolism that further enriched the conditions for the myth to take root; that before the constitution was amended, Indigenous Australians were classified according to a flora and fauna act — a completely incorrect conclusion.

pomt-12240	Says former Rep. Michele Bachmann said that "White People Have Suffered More In The Last 8 Years Than Blacks Did During Couple Years Of Slavery."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/14/uspoln/no-bachmann-didnt-say-whites-suffered-more-under-o/	Some clickbait is harder to kill than a vampire. Recently, as part of Facebook’s efforts to fight fake news, we learned that users had flagged as potentially fabricated a post about a claim purportedly by former Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn. Prior to her retirement after the 2014 midterm elections, Bachmann, a social conservative, was known for making controversial statements. So it may not come as a surprise that, more than two years after her retirement, she’s still being used by clickbait purveyors, banking on the anger of liberal social media users. The article noted by Facebook users, from the site USPOLN.com, is headlined, "Bachmann: ‘White People Have Suffered More In The Last 8 Years Than Blacks Did During Couple Years Of Slavery.’ " Oddly, the words that the headline attributes in quotation marks to Bachmann do not appear in the subsequent article. But the "quotes" provided discuss similar themes. The article quotes Bachmann as saying, "I don’t think all of the suffering of African-Americans during the period of slavery can ever equate to what’s been done to white conservative Americans in the past eight years of Obama’s presidency. Because, let’s face it, during that time, we’ve had the Supreme Court’s decision to legalize same-sex marriage, we’ve had countless terrorist attacks, we’ve had many racial killings and crimes and we’ve had several small-scale revolutions in some of America’s major cities. Is that the legacy President Obama wants to be remembered by? Does he really want to go down in history as the man who created a gap between black people and white people? Judging by his actions during his presidency, I’m guessing he does." Before we go any further, it would be an opportune time to note that USPOLN.com is, as we have noted previously, contains a disclaimer in the "about us" tab that reads, "USPOLN may include information from sources that may or may not be reliable and facts that don’t necessarily exist. These articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney." In other words, not a word of this "story" should be believed. However, this isn’t just fake news. It’s old fake news. (Perhaps the focus on Obama should have been a clue to its timing -- he’s been out of office for six months now.) We found that an essentially identical article appeared as early as Aug. 23, 2016, on the website Newslo, which bills itself as a mix of true and fake news. With the click of a button, you can see what’s real and what’s fake. If you click on the button, the part about Bachmann’s comments on slavery falls into the "fake" category. Moral of the story: Liberal dislike of Bachmann has survived her retirement so strongly that it is able to carry multiple iterations of clickbait. The website USPOLN.com said in a post that Bachmann had said, "White People Have Suffered More In The Last 8 Years Than Blacks Did During Couple Years Of Slavery." Not only is USPOLN.com an acknowledged "satirical" site, but the post originated in August 2016 on another acknowledged purveyor of articles that it admits are partially fake.

pomt-01834	Alaska Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Mark Begich "vote as much as 80 percent of the time together."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/17/mark-begich/do-alaska-senators-mark-begich-and-lisa-murkowski-/	Sen. Mark Begich says he and Sen. Lisa Murkowski are on the same team. But she doesn’t see it that way. Murkowski, a Republican, has said that she hopes Begich, a Democrat, loses his seat to a Republican challenger in November. Both senators currently represent Alaska. Despite Murkowski’s feelings, Begich is touting their teamwork in the Senate in a new radio ad. "Lisa Murkowski and Mark Begich vote as much as 80 percent of the time together — that’s healthy for Alaska. I have a great dislike for partisan politics," the ad says, narrated by a man identified as Skip Nelson, an aviator living in Anchorage. "I think Lisa and Mark are a great team for Alaska. I’d like to keep them there." Murkowski, who is not up for re-election this year, fired back, telling the Alaska Dispatch that the pair agrees on some Alaska-specific issues, but regarding national matters, "There is a real departure between where Mark stands and where I stand." And in a statement sent to PolitiFact, she said, "Over the last five years when we have taken a stand on the role of government in Alaskans' lives I have fundamentally disagreed with Sen. Begich... I believe we need less intervention from government while he pushes for more." The current Republican front-runner hoping to beat Begich is former Alaska Attorney General Dan Sullivan. Begich’s Republican opponents have tried to emphasize Begich’s ties to President Barack Obama and the Democratic Party. Considering this Congress’ penchant for polarization and Murkowski’s response, we thought it would be worthwhile to see if they really had voted together 80 percent of the time. The numbers The Begich campaign calculated the 80 percent figure using every roll call vote in 2014 in which both Murkowski and Begich participated, through July 2. Murkowski and Begich voted 183 times, according to the campaign’s data, which we confirmed. They voted together 148 times, and they disagreed 35 times. Based on these numbers, the senators voted together 80.8 percent of the time for the first six months of 2014. The 35 votes on which Begich and Murkowski disagreed in 2014 were primarily procedural, but the list also includes more than 10 judges’ and administrators’ confirmations that Murkowski opposed. However, the pair has served together since 2009, so this is just a slice of their voting records. Since the start of 2009, Begich and Murkowski have voted together 60 percent of the time, according to a comparison report by Congressional Quarterly, a nonpartisan outlet for congressional news and legislative tracking. Although the 80 percent statistic inflates their overall record of voting together, they do have a history of voting together that rivals other Senate pairs from opposing parties. In the current Congress (starting in 2013), 16 states have one Democratic senator and one Republican senator. Of these 16 pairs, Begich and Murkowski voted together the most, at a rate of 65 percent in the current Congress, according to OpenCongress’ head-to-head comparison tool. The pair with the next-highest rate of voting together is 47 percent, belonging to New Hampshire’s Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat, and Kelly Ayotte, Republican. OpenCongress’ data also showed that Murkowski is more likely than Begich to deviate from her party. She voted with Republicans 65 percent of the time in the current Congress, while Begich voted with Democrats 91 percent of the time. One other point: National Journal ranked Begich as the 48th most liberal and 52nd most conservative senator in 2013, based on roll call votes from that year. The magazine ranked Murkowski as 56th most liberal and 44th most conservative, showing that they are both moderate voters. How significant are these votes? In her retort, Murkowski said the votes from this year -- on which the Begich campaign based the 80 percent figure -- were largely procedural, and that’s correct. She said the two senators have differed on important votes throughout the six years they have served together. Here are a few votes with national significance since 2009 and whether or not they voted together: December 2009, On passage of the Affordable Care Act: Disagree (Begich voted "yes," Murkowski "no"); July 2010, On passage of the Dodd-Frank financial regulation bill: Disagree (Begich "yes," Murkowski "no"); April 2011, In favor of stopping the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating greenhouse gas emissions: Disagree (Begich "no," Murkowski "yes"); March 2013, In favor of constructing the Keystone XL pipeline: Agree (both "yes"); June 2013, On passage of the Senate immigration reform bill: Agree (both "yes"); October 2013, On passage of the budget bill ending the government shutdown: Agree (both "yes"); Jan. 30, 2014, On delaying the increase of flood insurance premium: Agree (both "yes"); July 16, 2014, Failed motion to consider a bill to reverse the Supreme Court’s Hobby Lobby decision: Agree (both "yes"). Our ruling A Begich campaign radio ad said, "Lisa Murkowski and Mark Begich vote as much as 80 percent of the time together." We found they had voted together 80 percent of the time. However, this statistic is based on the last six months, and Begich has served with Murkowski since 2009. The pair does, though, have a history of voting together more often than not -- about 60 percent of all votes since 2009 -- and the ad said "as much as 80 percent." We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-00576	47 percent of Americans "can’t pay for an unexpected $400 expense through savings or credit cards, without selling something or borrowing money."	true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jun/09/hunter-schwarz/47-say-they-lack-ready-cash-pay-surprise-400-bill/	The economic struggles of ordinary Americans are getting a good airing this presidential season and a statistical finding from the Federal Reserve provides ammunition for a candidate in either party who wants to make the case that too many people have been left behind. Washington Post reporter Hunter Schwarz plugged some Fed data into a little segment called "By the numbers", in the newspaper’s June 8, 2015, edition: "47: The percentage of Americans who can’t pay for an unexpected $400 expense through savings or credit cards, without selling something or borrowing money, according to the Federal Reserve." The dollar figure caught our eye. It seemed surprisingly low. Other researchers have tried to gauge the financial vulnerability of American households to an economic setback, but typically, the amounts they test are much higher, in the thousands of dollars. We thought we’d take a closer look. The Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking A few years ago, the Federal Reserve Board began asking Americans how well they’re doing financially. In May, the Fed released the 2014 results. The questions ranged from retirement planning, to how people managed any student debt they might have, to whether they think their overall situation is headed up or down. To measure participants’ sense of financial vulnerability, the survey asked them to imagine they had an emergency expense that cost $400, and it asked them how they would cover it. The better-off group said they would use cash-on-hand or a credit card that they would pay off in a month. Others said they would use a credit card but take time to pay it off, or they might borrow from a family member or a pay-day loan company, or they might sell something. And some said there was no way they could cover an unexpected $400 expense. Across the more than 5,800 people who completed the online survey, 53 percent said they would be able to pay essentially immediately. That left 47 percent who said they could not. "Specifically, respondents indicate that they simply could not cover the expense (14 percent); would sell something (10 percent); or would rely on one or more means of borrowing to pay for at least part of the expense, including paying with a credit card that they pay off over time (18 percent), borrowing from friends or family (13 percent), or using a payday loan (2 percent)," the report said. Interestingly, making over $100,000 a year was no guarantee of security. About a quarter of the more affluent group said that at the very least, they would pay off the $400 over time. As this chart from the report shows, ethnicity and income strongly affected the ability to absorb a $400 outlay. Other studies George Washington University business professor Annamaria Lusardi and two colleagues (Daniel J. Schneider at Princeton University and Peter Tufano at Oxford University) conducted a similar survey in the depths of the recession in 2009. Their study asked people how they would handle a sudden $2,000 bill that they had to pay in 30 days. About half the respondents said they would probably or certainly be unable to cope with such an emergency out of their own funds. Lusardi said she considers the results comparable. "The Federal Reserve had a lower amount, but it had to be paid right away," she told PunditFact. "We gave people more time, so I think the percentages are consistent." In fact, even with five years separating the surveys, it is the similarity in the responses that caught her eye. Lusardi said it is a sign of the recession’s deep damage to the typical American’s balance sheet. "Until recently, the labor market and wages have been stagnant," Lusardi said. "In the recession, many families used up their reserves of liquidity. It takes a long time to reestablish a good financial situation." There are other indications that most Americans live with a limited financial cushion. When the government shutdown for two weeks in 2013, a University of Michigan research team tracked a hefty drop in household spending among government workers. Even though their paychecks were interrupted only a short time, households cut their outlays in half, and many delayed paying their mortgages and credit card bills. Some racked up high cost credit card debt that took them up to nine months to pay back. Lusardi’s 2009 research included a number of other western nations. For the record, the United States ranked sixth out of eight in residents saying they would certainly or probably be able to manage a sudden $2,000 bill. Rank/Country Percent able to cope Rank/Country Percent able to cope 1. Italy 80.1 5. Portugal 54.1 2. Netherlands 73.2 6. United States 50 3. Canada 71.7 7. Germany 49.4 4. France 62.8 8. United Kingdom 47.8 Our ruling Schwarz said 47 percent of Americans can’t pay for an unexpected $400 expense through savings or credit cards, without selling something or borrowing money. The only caveat here, and it’s a very minor one, is that figure represents the number of people who say they can’t make that payment, based on a Federal Reserve Board survey. The Federal Reserve Board results are in line with a similar study and related research. We rate the claim True.	None	Hunter Schwarz	None	None	None	2015-06-09T12:05:48	2015-06-08	['United_States']

pomt-04900	"An April study found that about 70 percent of ads in this election cycle have been negative [due to SuperPACs], up from only 9 percent through the same period in 2008."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/aug/05/sheldon-whitehouse/sen-sheldon-whitehouse-ri-says-growth-superpacs-le/	Negative campaign ads: most people say they hate them, but studies show that many people are swayed by them. Thus, major races can get pretty nasty, and there's a fear that the presidential contest this year will break all records for nastiness, thanks to the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision. The court upheld the right of persons, organizations and corporations to spend as much as they would like on political advertising -- while hiding their involvement -- through the use of organizations known as super political action committees (Super-PACs). To shed some light on who is behind such attack ads, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-RI, has been promoting the DISCLOSE Act. The name is an acronym for Democracy Is Strengthened by Casting Light on Spending in Elections. "When you don't have accountability, there's no limit to the things that people will say," Whitehouse said during a debate on the floor of the Senate. "One of the restraints on the vitriol and the filth that so often is part of the American political debate is that candidates have to stand by their ads. "And if you say something that is awful, if you engage in relentless negative attacks, voters may charge you a price for that," Whitehouse said. "Well, that of course disappears when the name behind the ad is attached to no living person or corporation. It's just an entity, it's a sham, it's a phony, it's a shell." The DISCLOSE act would require some tax-exempt groups that engage in political advertising to reveal individual donors who gave $10,000 or more. Critics say the act discriminates because it wouldn't apply to unions. They also say disclosure might open donors up to intimidation and ridicule, inhibiting free speech. During an unsuccessful push to bring the proposal to a vote in the Senate -- a drive blocked twice by Republicans, on July 16 and 17 -- Whitehouse said the Citizens United decision was already sparking a giant increase in negative political advertising. "An April study found that about 70 percent of ads in this election cycle have been negative, up from only 9 percent through the same period in 2008," he said. That's a big jump in negative advertising. We wondered if it were true. The context When we contacted Whitehouse's office, spokesman Seth Larson sent us to a study released May 2, 2012, by the Wesleyan Media Project at Wesleyan University. It defined a negative advertisement as an ad in which the candidate's opponent is mentioned. The study looked only at TV ads in the presidential races and only ads broadcast from January 1 through April 22 of 2008 and the same period in 2012. It turns out that Whitehouse quoted the study accurately. The researchers said that 70.0 percent of all ads in 2012 were negative during that period, compared with 9.1 percent in 2008. But Whitehouse also said that the Citizens United decision is responsible for that increase in negative ads, so let’s look at that aspect. The political scientists we spoke with said the Supreme Court decision is having a huge effect on the tone and rhythm of the 2012 campaign. The Wesleyan study suggests that the effect was already clear in the first four months of this year. Consider the ads purchased by special-interest groups or SuperPACs. Of the 10,062 special-interest group ads aired during the first quarter of 2008, 75 percent were rated positive and 25 percent were rated negative. By 2012, the number of special-interest ads had exploded, jumping more than 12-fold to 123,062. In addition, the mix of ads had reversed, with only 14 percent positive and 86 percent negative. Meanwhile, the number of ads bought by candidates themselves plummeted, from 289,622 in the first quarter of 2008 to 74,267 this year, an indication that they were letting the special interest ads carry the ball for promoting their candidacies. As Michael Franz, co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project, said in the report, "That's a lot of money and airtime backed by undisclosed sources." Other factors affect rate But Franz and the other experts we consulted cautioned that additional factors are also at work. The first four months of the 2008 race were very different from the same period in the 2012 contest. In early 2008, "one reason the number was so low was because the [Barack] Obama and [Hillary] Clinton campaigns didn't really attack each other on TV that much," said Franz, now at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine. "They did off the air, and they were obviously quite ruthless. But in the ads themselves, there wasn't a lot of sniping back and forth against each other. They promoted themselves primarily. "That changed for Obama in the general election," Franz said. "He was a very negative candidate and once the general election started, it became an overwhelmingly negative campaign, as it usually is in the general election." During the first four months of 2012, SuperPACs drove up the percentage of negative ads, he said, "but also candidates have been overwhelmingly negative against each other in the [2012] Republican primary." So let's look at the types of ads placed by the candidates themselves. In 2008, only 9 percent of the ads placed by all the candidates in the first four months of the year were negative. By 2012 that number had grown to nearly 53 percent. The first four months of a presidential election year are not necessarily the best guide to the rhythm of the rest of a presidential campaign. "I really don't think they're indicative of what's to come," said Mary Ellen Balchunis, a political scientist at LaSalle University in Philadelphia. "It's how close the polls are, it's whether your opponent is going negative, it's whether you are responding." Early in the contest, "the ads are generally more about who the candidate is and what the candidate would do. That's particularly true for a challenger," said Stephen Farnsworth of the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Va., a key swing state. "There are always some negative ads, but they are really sprinkled in the mix. In the fall, when people are really turning their attention to the election, that's when the number of negative ads escalates." "In this election cycle, things are already so negative, it's hard to imagine that there's much room for them to get more negative between now and November," said Farnsworth, author of "Spinner-in-Chief: How Presidents Sell Their Policies and Themselves." Our ruling Sheldon Whitehouse said, "An April study found that about 70 percent of ads in this election cycle have been negative, up from only 9 percent through the same period in 2008." He is correctly quoting the study, but the context of his comment makes it clear that he blames the SuperPACs, which were freed up by the Citizens United decision. Those special-interest groups are certainly playing a much larger role this year, in part because they have become the major source of TV ad purchases. But the data also reveal that the candidates are being far more negative earlier in the campaign than they were four years ago, and that also drove up the percentage of negative ads in the beginning of 2012. Because his statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate the claim as Mostly True. (Get updates from PolitiFact Rhode Island on Twitter: @politifactri.

pomt-08395	"In Rhode Island, there were thousands of jobs that were created" by the federal stimulus program	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/oct/23/james-langevin/langevin-says-stimulus-program-created-thousands-j/	Update: On Oct. 21, 2010, we rated as Barely True a statement by U.S. Rep. James R. Langevin that the federal stimulus program created thousands of jobs in Rhode Island. We have discovered that we misread a chart at recovery.gov that showed the number of stimulus jobs created in Rhode Island. This is a revised story that clarifies the number but does not change the ruling. With the national and state economies both sagging, the effectiveness of the federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, better known as the stimulus bill, has been a focus of debate in this year’s congressional elections. During a debate with Republican Mark Zaccaria on Oct. 14 on WLNE-TV, sponsored by the League of Women Voters, Langevin, a strong supporter of the stimulus program, said it had "created thousands of jobs here." Debating Zaccaria two days later on the WPRI "Newsmakers" program, Langevin said: "In Rhode Island, there were thousands of jobs that were created" by the stimulus program. We wondered: Has the stimulus program created thousands of Rhode Island jobs? Trying to determine the employment effect of a specific government program can be difficult, but the Recovery Act included specific provisions that required the government to post online information detailing how much money was spent, where it was spent and on what. Included in that is the number of work hours paid for with stimulus money, expressed as the equivalent of a 40-hour-a-week worker. The current Rhode Island number, posted at Recovery. gov, the federal website with the stimulus spending data, is 1,989.58. But that’s for the three-month period from April 1 to June 30, 2010, not, as we initially reported, for the duration of the stimulus program, which started in February 2009. So what’s the real number of new Rhode Island jobs created by the stimulus since February 2009? Laurie Petrone of the state Office of Recovery and Reinvestment, the official who tracks stimulus aid here, said it’s impossible to say. When the program began, Petrone said, the federal government asked participating state agencies and employers to keep count of new jobs created by the stimulus. The first reporting period was for Feb. 17 to Sept. 30, 2009. Contractors and agencies were to report the number of full-time and part-time work hours that stimulus money paid for. Those hours were then added up and the total converted into full-time workers. For those first eight months, Petrone said the statewide jobs number for participating public and private sector employers was 1,960.82. For the next period, Oct. 1, 2009 to the end of 2009, it was 1,900.86. The reported figure for Jan. 1, 2010 to March 31, 2010, dropped to 530 because many Rhode Island agencies and contractors weren’t able to file timely reports due to the late-March flooding in the state, Petrone said. Then there’s the 1,989.58 figure for the April 1, to June 30, 2010 period, which is the one on the Recovery,gov website now. Because many stimulus programs are reaching the end of their funding, the quarterly job numbers may start to go down, she said. Petrone said it’s hard to determine how many new jobs were created and how many preserved because there was no clear definition of what represented a new job. At the beginning of the program, she said, any work that was paid for in the first eight months was counted in the total. If the job carried over into the next quarter, it was counted as a stimulus job then as well. But that means you can’t get a cumulative picture by adding the quarterly reports together, she said, because you would wind up counting carried-over workers twice. Each quarterly report has to be looked at as a "discrete snapshot" by itself. Petrone said that means there is no way to know how many of the 1,900.86 jobs in the second reporting period from Oct 1-Dec. 31, 2009 included workers who would have been laid off but were not, new workers who would not have been hired without the stimulus money, or workers whose existing jobs carried over from the previous period. The same applies to the next two reporting periods. There were other problems. Petrone said states and contractors were confused over how to classify new and retained jobs. She gave the example of a state agency that got a stimulus grant and used it for a specific project that added hours to an existing part time worker’s duties. "Is that a new job, or a saved job, or a retained job?" Petrone asked. The guidelines were unclear. In December 2009, in response to confusion and complaints about the reporting process, federal Office of Management and Budget Director Peter R. Orszag told reporting entities to avoid any "subjective judgment on whether jobs were created or retained" and just report hours worked, in the equivalent of full-time jobs, that were financed by Recovery Act funds. Langevin spokeswoman Joy Fox said the Recovery.gov figures show only part of the program’s effects. It doesn’t count the effect of tax cuts and secondary hiring caused by the increased economic activity the stimulus generated. She pointed to a July 14 analysis by the president’s Council of Economic advisers, which estimated that, overall, the stimulus program has created or saved 11,000 jobs in Rhode Island. The council’s report used a broader definition than Langevin did, including jobs saved, not just created. The council reached its 11,000 figure by estimating that 3.04 million jobs were saved or created nationally by the Recover Act. It then extrapolated jobs numbers for each state. The council defends its methodology but cautions that the state numbers are "inherently more speculative and uncertain." We can’t determine exactly how many stimulus jobs were created in Rhode Island. Even Petrone, the state official keeping tabs on stimulus spending, can’t determine that. Nor can Langevin. The highest quarterly report shows 1,989.58 jobs actually created. It’s close enough to 2,000 to be literally true, but, in our opinion, less than "thousands" would imply. For those reasons, we rate his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05295	"Right now, we have the lowest gas tax of anywhere in the country."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/may/22/colleen-kiernan/does-georgia-have-lowest-gas-taxes-country/	The Georgia Sierra Club surprised many when it recently announced it is against this summer’s voter referendum for a penny-per-dollar sales tax to pay for 157 projects aimed at easing traffic congestion in the Atlanta region. The grass-roots environmental organization believes the current project list needs more ways to get Georgians away from their cars. (Just over half of the regional $6.14 billion list would go to mass transit projects, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has reported.) Director Colleen Kiernan suggested in a radio interview that the state could fund more mass transit projects by using money from Georgia’s gas tax. She said the tax, which helps fund area road and bridge work, has contributed to metro Atlanta’s asphalt-focused development patterns. Kiernan then made a claim about the gas tax that had PolitiFact Georgia ready to take a road trip in a search for the truth. "Right now, we have the lowest gas tax of anywhere in the country," Kiernan told WABE-FM’s Denis O’Hayer. Kiernan thought she said Georgia has one of the lowest gas taxes in the nation. She argued she should still get high marks from the Truth-O-Meter. "It should definitely be on the green side," she said, arguing for a Mostly True rating. Kiernan sent us a report by University of Georgia researchers on whether the state’s motor use fuel tax collects enough revenue. The state’s Transportation Department asked UGA to do the research. The motor use fuel tax in most states is an excise tax, but several states impose an excise tax, as well as a sales tax that is applied to the sale price of gasoline. Georgia’s excise tax is currently 7.5 cents a gallon. (Excise taxes are special taxes on the purchase of items such as gasoline, alcoholic beverages and tobacco products. Excise taxes are usually fixed amounts per item, rather than percentages of the price.) Georgia adds a 3 percent tax on sales of motor fuel that is classified as motor use fuel tax and a 1 percent tax that is received as general fund revenue. In 2008, the excise tax and both sales taxes combined produced an effective rate of 21.2 cents per gallon, the UGA report noted. About 17.8 cents per gallon is classified as motor use fuel tax, UGA said. The UGA report, which came out in December 2010, said Georgia has one of the lowest excise taxes around, but Georgia is higher than most of its Southern neighbors if you include the sales taxes. Kiernan also forwarded us a link to a February 2010 report by the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization that does research on state and federal tax policy. The report showed Georgia’s gas tax per gallon was 12.4 cents, which was the second lowest in the nation. Alaska was the lowest at 8 cents per gallon. "Alaska is a different situation ... because they get so much of the revenue from oil and gas leasing," Kiernan said. PolitiFact Georgia also looked at a January 2012 Tax Foundation state-by-state breakdown of state tax and other gas taxes and fees. Georgia’s excise tax was the second lowest (only Florida was lower). Other taxes and fees pushed the Peach State into the upper half of states with the 18th highest gas taxes at 29.4 cents per gallon. But those other fees and taxes include various county gas taxes. Kiernan was talking about state taxes. An April 2012 breakdown by the American Petroleum Institute had the same numbers for most states, including Georgia, as the January Tax Foundation report. The breakdown has a column that includes federal taxes, which are 18.4 cents per gallon in every state. Kiernan erred a bit in what she meant to say on a radio show with a large audience. Her larger point is supported by several charts that show Georgia has one of the lowest excise gas taxes in the nation. Her statement could have been more precise. Still, under our rating system, she gets a Mostly True.	None	Colleen Kiernan	None	None	None	2012-05-22T06:00:00	2012-05-14	['None']
pomt-06896	Says Tim Pawlenty said in 2006, "The era of small government is over... the government has to be more proactive and more aggressive."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/26/michele-bachmann/did-tim-pawlenty-say-era-small-government-over/	What happened to Minnesota nice? Michele Bachmann blasted her fellow Minnesotan Tim Pawlenty after he questioned her experience. The two are competing for the Republican nomination for president. "These are serious times that require serious solutions -- not more of the same. Being right on the issues is critical -- it is what the American people demand. Executive experience is not an asset if it simply means bigger and more intrusive government," Bachmann said in a prepared statement on July 24, 2011. "Governor Pawlenty said in 2006, 'The era of small government is over... the government has to be more proactive and more aggressive.' That's the same philosophy that, under President Obama, has brought us record deficits, massive unemployment and an unconstitutional health care plan." We wanted to see if Bachmann was correct about what Pawlenty said about small government, as it seems like a sentiment unlikely to be popular in a Republican primary. We contacted both campaigns for comment but didn't hear back from either one. We were able to easily find the comment; it originated with an August 2006 report in the Minneapolis Star Tribune. (We found it in the Nexis newspaper database.) "Pawlenty sees his role as reformer," says the headline. "The GOP governor has targeted what he calls excessive corporate power. Critics call his election-year 'populism' cosmetic." The story says that starting in 2006, Pawlenty "repeatedly made himself a nuisance to major industries that frequently back Republicans," particularly calling on Congress to put new regulations on prescription drug companies and auto makers. The story said he called for a two-year ban on advertising prescription drugs, urged regulators to speed the release of generic insulin products and proposed new regulations to support the use of ethanol. "Those kinds of proposals for government intervention in the free market on the surface might seem unusual coming from a conservative GOP politician. But they are illustrations of the way that Pawlenty, a fiscal and social conservative, also styles himself a kind of latter-day trust buster, a reformer who is unafraid to challenge big business and wield government power to correct imbalances in the marketplace," the story said. And here's the key section: "The era of small government is over," Pawlenty said in an interview with the Star Tribune. "I'm a market person, but there are certain circumstances where you've got to have government put up the guardrails or bust up entrenched interests before they become too powerful ... Government has to be more proactive, more aggressive." ... Pawlenty insists his own populist streak is no election-year attempt to steer toward the middle. Peel back the conservative, he said, and you find the boy who grew up near South St. Paul's stockyards and learned what happened when power became too concentrated. When companies gain too much power, he said, they can suppress wages. Drug companies can command high prices for brand-name products long after they could have gone generic. Oil companies can use their muscle to keep out renewable fuels. HMOs can shift costs from their members to the public at large. While he may not fit the DFL [Democratic-Farm-Labor Party] definition of a populist, Pawlenty said, "it's a matter of where you draw the line. ... I know that concentrated power unchecked leads to bad things," he said. We're not sure what Pawlenty's own reaction to the story was, but his press secretary didn't like it. The next day, the Star Tribune ran a "clarification," that said the story "quoted Gov. Tim Pawlenty saying 'The era of small government is over,' a comment he made in reference to a point made in a 2004 column by New York Times columnist David Brooks. Pawlenty spokesman Brian McClung said Monday that Pawlenty's record shows he is not a supporter of 'big government' and that he was 'simply talking about the need for government to be more effective and active.'" The Star Tribune story doesn't mention David Brooks, but we went searching for the relevant story, and it seems likely it was a story Brooks wrote for the New York Times Magazine that took the measure of the conservative movement in 2004, headlined "How to re-invent the G.O.P." In the story, Brooks noted that historical forces like Islamic extremism and the end of socialism were changing the nature of conservatism, pushing it away from a minimalist vision for government. The new conservatism "understands the paradox that if you don't have a positive vision of government, you won't be able to limit the growth of government. If you can't offer people a vision of what government should do, you won't be able to persuade them about the things it shouldn't do. If the Republican Party is going to evolve into a principled majority party, members of this group are going to have to build a governing philosophy based on this insight," Brooks wrote. Brooks said George W. Bush typified this new approach. "By the time he began his campaign for president in 1999, Bush understood that the simple government-is-the-problem philosophy of the older Republicans was obsolete. During that campaign, Bush criticized what he called the 'destructive mind-set: the idea that if government would only get out of our way, all our problems would be solved. An approach with no higher goal, no nobler purpose, than "Leave us alone.''' Instead, Bush argued, 'government must be carefully limited but strong and active.'" Pawlenty maintains that he was incorrectly quoted in the Star Tribune story. In May 2011, he went on Rush Limbaugh's radio show, and Limbaugh asked him if he had indeed said, "The era of small government is over." "The other side has pushed that falsely for a number of years," Pawleny said, according to the show's transcript. "What happened is in the Minnesota Star Tribune -- not exactly a conservative publication -- I made reference to an article that David Brooks wrote which was entitled, 'The Era of Small Government is Over.' I didn't say those words myself; I was referencing his article. "The very next day, the Star Tribune, after a big battle, printed a clarification or a correction in their correction page," he continued. "Of course, the main article was on page one and the correction was buried in some footnote in page three, but that incorrect quote has haunted me -- and I'm glad I had a chance in this big national forum on your great show to clarify, because if you go to the next day's newspaper you'll see the clarification in the Star Tribune." We should note that the headline of the Brooks' article we found was not "The Era of Small Government is Over," but we won't quibble about that. Pawlenty could have seen the article or another one like it somewhere with a modified headline, and the phrase certainly captures the article's sentiment. We also contacted the Star Tribune to see if it still stood by the story. The story's author, Patricia Lopez, is now the newspaper's political editor. Here's what she said: "The governor was quoted correctly, which is why we printed only a clarification. He was quoting a David Brooks column, but as you can see, it was in support of other statements he made about the role of government. He never asked to have any other statement in the article corrected." But even if Pawlenty was quoting Brooks when he said the phrase "the era of small government is over" during the interview, he seemed to be doing so approvingly. The rest of the article portrays Pawlenty as someone who was willing to use government to intervene in the markets and gives examples to support that. Here's a little more from the story. "Oil companies have played a role in suppressing the development of alternative fuels," Pawlenty said, with heavy-handed contracts that prevent gasoline stations from providing pumps for renewable fuels such as ethanol. With the nation's economic security at stake, "that is disproportionate power," he said. "Government has to step in." Similarly, when he testified before Congress for reimportation of drugs from Canada, where prices are government-regulated, Pawlenty said he got a taste of the pharmaceutical industry's might. "I've seen it firsthand," he said. "They've got a power that would frighten most citizens." Pawlenty has changed positions on energy policy; he once supported a cap and trade system but no longer does. We looked for any recent statements he's made about reimporting drugs from Canada, but couldn't find any. We also asked two political watchers in Minnesota if the Star Tribune story was generally reflective of Pawlenty's political views in 2006. They said it was. "In terms of his views on government, I think he can best be described as actively wanting to use the government to achieve certain ends, only with less taxes," said David Schultz, a professor at Hamline University who studies Minnesota politics. Schultz said Pawlenty's rhetoric became more conservative starting around 2008, when his name was mentioned as a potential running mate for John McCain. "In fairness, Pawlenty did restrain spending by the Democratic Legislature. But he was more moderate on several other issues than he now appears, and the (Star Tribune story) is an example of that," said Steve Schier, a professor of political science at Carleton College. So where does this leave us? Back in 2006, Pawlenty was portraying himself as a conservative who was willing to intervene in markets, and he said that government has to "bust up entrenched interests before they become too powerful." It appears he's been backing off those positions in 2011, but that doesn't change what his views were years ago. If he was quoting David Brooks when he said "the era of small government is over," he seemed to be doing so approvingly, though a spokesman said he did not mean to imply that he supported "big government."

pomt-00854	The state of Florida has seen "double-digit drops" in alcohol use among teens.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/mar/18/susan-pitman/teen-alcohol-abuse-has-dropped-double-digits-advoc/	As the Legislature considers changing rules for Florida’s burgeoning craft beer industry, one advocacy group is saying it’s important to maintain the state’s downward trend in teen alcohol abuse. During debate at the Senate commerce and tourism committee about whether to let breweries sell 64-ounce growlers, Susan Pitman, a board member for a collection of drug abuse prevention groups called the Florida Coalition Alliance, urged lawmakers to consider limiting pour sizes in beer-tasting rooms. Pitman said that preventing alcohol abuse demands regulation of these tasting rooms. "While the country as a whole has seen a decline in youth drinking, the state of Florida is a leader, with double-digit drops in 30-day teen alcohol use," she said. Pitman’s arguments may have had some impact; sponsor Sen. Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, agreed to revisit his bill. But in the meantime, we wondered: Has the declining drinking rate of Florida’s minors really dropped as much as Pitman said? (We considered checking whether Florida’s decline made it a "leader" among states, but we backed off after we learned that the state and national numbers -- which also are on the decline -- aren’t precisely comparable.) Pitman, who also serves as executive director of Jacksonville-based Drug Free Duval, told PolitiFact Florida that she got her talking point from the Florida Youth Substance Abuse Survey. That’s an annual questionnaire given to middle and high school students in order to collect data about risky behaviors, such as smoking and drug use. The survey is coordinated by the state departments of Children and Families, Education, Health, Juvenile Justice and the Governor's Office of Drug Control. The 2014 report is drawn from answers from almost 70,000 Florida students from all 67 counties. There are several questions measuring alcohol use, including binge drinking and whether kids have ever tried alcohol. But in the category Pitman cites -- the percentage of children who had used alcohol during the past 30 days -- the data show a distinct decrease over the last decade. Grade 2004 2014 Decline, 2004-2014 Middle schoolers 20.3 percent 10.1 percent 10.2 points High schoolers 42.0 percent 28.4 percent 13.6 points That’s a double-digit drop for both categories, providing strong evidence for Pitman’s claim. The only caveat is that there’s a different data set that leads to slightly different results. Every two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention undertakes a survey for the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System. It’s conducted every odd-numbered year during the spring semester for grades 9-12 and for middle schoolers. The 2013 data was culled from more than 13,000 forms filled out in schools across the United States. The CDC survey doesn’t offer 30-day alcohol data for middle schoolers, but it does for high schoolers. For Florida, the survey found that between 2003 and 2013, alcohol use by high schoolers during the previous 30 days dropped from 42.7 percent to 34.8 percent. That’s a decline of a little under 8 percentage points -- a bit shy of a double-digit drop. Our ruling Pitman said Florida has seen "double-digit drops" in alcohol use among teens. A survey conducted by the state does show double-digit drops for both middle- and high-schoolers over the last decade, though the decline for high schoolers in a survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found a decline of about 8 percentage points. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Susan Pitman	None	None	None	2015-03-18T14:01:39	2015-03-16	['None']

pomt-08807	"In 1935, more than 50% of the elderly population lived in poverty. Today that poverty rate stands officially at 9.4%."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/17/eddie-bernice-johnson/texas-congresswoman-eddie-bernice-johnson-says-soc/	Aug. 14, 2010, marked the 75th anniversary of the signing of the Social Security Act, and in the run-up to that landmark anniversary, U.S. Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Texas, praised the program in a speech on the House floor. "On the third anniversary of the Social Security Act, President Roosevelt said, 'We have come a long way. But we still have a long way to go. There is still today a frontier that remains unconquered — an America unclaimed. This is the great, the nationwide frontier of insecurity, of human want and fear. This is the frontier — the America — we have set ourselves to reclaim.' Today, much of that dream has been realized. While we may never completely eradicate poverty, great strides have been made. In 1935, more than 50% of the elderly population lived in poverty. Today that poverty rate stands officially at 9.4%," she said on Aug. 10, 2010. We don't have the expertise to judge the effectiveness of social safety net programs, but we did want to check Johnson's claim that "in 1935, more than 50% of the elderly population lived in poverty. Today that poverty rate stands officially at 9.4%." We began with the latter statistic. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, which has been collecting official poverty data for the past several decades, the poverty rate for individuals 65 and older in 2008 -- the latest year for which data are available -- was 9.7 percent. That's pretty close to the figure that Johnson cited. The second number was a bit harder to verify. The U.S. Census Bureau did not begin tracking the poverty rate until 1959. On top of that, data for individuals aged 65 and older are not available for the years 1960 through 1965. We spoke with Deborah Johnson, a senior editor and writer at the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Johnson told us to check out a 1987 study from Eugene Smolensky, Sheldon Danziger, and Peter Gottschalk. The three researchers used data from the 1940 and 1950 Censuses to extend the poverty line back to 1939. How did things look back then? Among men 64 and older, the poverty rate in 1939 was 78 percent. For women, it was 77.5 percent. But what about 1935? "Even ... 78% would probably be a slightly conservative estimate since poverty for all persons in 1939 was considerably lower in 1939 than in 1935," Smolensky wrote us in an e-mail. He said that by his estimates, in 1935, the poverty rate for all families was 69.4 percent. For the elderly, it could have been up to 20 percent higher. Still, the paper also notes that due to changes in the survey methodology, "data presented here for 1939 are not directly comparable to the data for later years." We also looked at research from Robert Plotnick, professor of public affairs at University of Washington. Plotnick and his colleagues (including Smolensky) extended the poverty threshold, adjusting for inflation, back to 1914. In 1935, the poverty rate for the entire U.S. population was 64.9 percent. Plotnick told us that he does not have a breakdown by age, but "since poverty among elders was consistently higher than for the overall population until the mid 1970s, it would be reasonable to assume poverty among the elders in 1935 was at least 50 percent." We asked Johnson's office for a source for the claim and were told that it comes from material that references Growing Old in America, a 1978 publication by David Fischer, now a history professor at Brandeis University. Page 226 contains the statistic that Johnson may have been talking about: "Dependent poverty among the old grew inexorably, from 23 percent in 1910 to 40 percent in 1930, and 50 percent in 1935." The term "dependent poverty" puzzled us, and we tried to reach Fischer to clarify what he meant by that, but he did not respond to our query. Plotnick said it is not a standard term currently used in academic literature. After some research, we did find an instance of the term in the writings of Thomas Malthus, the 19th Century English economist known for the Malthusian theory that population, left unchecked, outstrips food supplies and leads to disaster. Malthus used "dependent poverty'' to describe someone who depends upon charity for survival. That may be similar to what Johnson was talking about, but it is not the same concept. During her speech, she specifically referenced the U.S. "poverty rate," which is a formal term from the U.S. Census. We talked to some of the top researchers in this field, and they all agreed: the best estimates show that the elderly poverty rate in 1935 was probably somewhere in the range of 70 to 90 percent. So, to review, Johnson said that "in 1935, more than 50% of the elderly population lived in poverty. Today that poverty rate stands officially at 9.4%." We found no official statistics for the rate of elderly poverty for the year 1935, only academic projections, and making apples-to-apples comparisons between eras is difficult. But those estimates indicate that Johnson may have seriously underestimated the level of poverty for older Americans amid the Great Depression. Still, Johnson's underlying point stands. The poverty rate among the elderly has dramatically declined. Whether that was the result of Social Security or other factors is beyond the scope of this review. By the best available measures the rate in 1935 was, as she stated, more than 50 percent. And she was just a fraction off on the current level of 9.7 percent. So we rate her statement True.

pomt-09571	"Here in Virginia, we have the opportunity to become the first state on the East Coast to explore for and produce oil and natural gas offshore."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/28/bob-mcdonnell/mcdonnell-says-virginia-first-line-atlantic-oil-dr/	In the Republican response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union speech, newly elected Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell said his state had the chance to be the first on the Atlantic coast to drill offshore for oil and natural gas. "Advances in technology can unleash more natural gas, nuclear, wind, coal, alternative energy that will lower your utility bills," McDonnell said Jan. 27, 2010, from the floor of Virginia's House of Delegates. "Here in Virginia, we have the opportunity to become the first state on the East Coast to explore for and produce oil and natural gas offshore." If drilling happens in the Atlantic, is Virginia first in line? Drilling in the Atlantic -- like in the eastern Gulf of Mexico -- has been taboo until recently. The Minerals Management Service, an arm of the U.S. Department of the Interior, has not held a lease sale for oil or natural gas drilling in the Atlantic since 1983. No leases remain active. The MMS, however, included 2.9 million acres off the shores of Virginia as part of its 2007-2012 gas and oil leasing program. But exploration was prohibited by both executive order and a congressional moratorium. That changed in the summer of 2008. President George W. Bush lifted the executive order banning drilling, then Congress allowed the moratorium to expire. In November of that year, the MMS initiated what it called a "multiyear" leasing process for the rights to drill off Virginia's coast. The area potentially open to drilling would start 50 miles offshore and sits north of the opening of the Chesapeake Bay, closest to Virginia's Eastern Shore counties on the Delmarva Peninsula. The MMS says the area may contain 130 million barrels of oil and 1.14 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. It's the only area in the Atlantic under consideration. Why is McDonnell bringing this up? He believes the Obama administration has done little to move the lease sale ahead. The MMS says it won't happen before 2011. In a letter to Interior Secretary Ken Salazar on Dec. 23, 2009, McDonnell pressed for prompt action, saying drilling could create 2,578 new jobs over 10 years and $271 million in state and local taxes. Those figures, which McDonnell says were based on a 2005 report by the former president of Old Dominion University, subsequently have been questioned. But that's not what we're checking. McDonnell said Virginia was ready to "be the first state on the East Coast to explore for and produce oil and natural gas offshore." Indeed, the nearly 3 million acres off the coast of Virginia is the only area in the Atlantic in the federal government's current five-year oil and gas leasing program. It also is the only area currently in the leasing process. It puts Virginia at the head of the class. And it makes McDonnell right. We rate his claim True.

pomt-06329	The city of Pembroke Pines doesn't have a vote in a plan to build a detention center in Southwest Ranches.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2011/nov/10/frank-ortis/pembroke-pines-vote-southwest-ranches/	Southwest Ranches is a tiny wealthy suburban enclave in western Broward County where some residents still ride horses, and the town once fought a street light proposal because residents didn't want the lights to interfere with their view of the stars. Now the rural-suburban oasis has become embroiled in controversy because of a longtime plan to build a jail. The town's plan to have a jail on the site had been publicly discussed for many years. But an uproar erupted in 2011, when U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement announced that it had tentatively selected the Southwest Ranches site for an immigration detention facility. The Miami-based Florida Immigrant Coalition, a pro-immigration group that opposes the jail, robo-called nearby residents. U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat who represents the area, wrote a letter of support for the project in April 2011, along with U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson. But as the controversy grew, Wasserman Schultz later wrote a letter to the town's mayor urging the town to hold a meeting with U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement (ICE), and that meeting occurred Nov. 5. Hundreds of residents gathered at a library to voice their concern. The Miami Herald described the meeting as a circus-like atmosphere -- replete with plenty of roving sheriff's deputies and a "First Amendment" area. The angry crowd was clearly against the project, and Mayor Frank Ortis, from neighboring Pembroke Pines, drew the biggest applause, the Miami Herald wrote. Watch Ortis on the city's video of the meeting starting around minute 76: "Let me just say that the longer I sit at this meeting, the angrier I'm getting," Ortis said. "Many of you who have contacted our office I've told you this is a Southwest Ranches issue. We don't have a vote in it. Let me just finish. We don't have a vote in it. This is what happens when you don't go to the people first." (The Herald's article also included most of that quote.) Ortis' passionate speech prompted someone at the meeting to suggest "Frank Ortis for governor." Ortis, first elected as a commissioner in 1996 and mayor in 2004, ingratiated himself with the angry opponents of the prison. But was he correct to state that Pembroke Pines doesn't have a vote in the project? Jail in works since 1990s First, some background on the immigration detention facility. A jail has been in the works in the area for decades. In 1991, Broward County commissioners agreed to buy nearly 70 acres in unincorporated southwest Broward for a future 4,000-bed county jail, which at the time would have been the nation's fifth-largest jailhouse, the Sun-Sentinel reported then. A jail overcrowding crisis prompted the county to buy the site, but in lieu of developing it the county expanded a jail facility in Pompano Beach instead. In 1998 Corrections Corporation of America, called CCA, bought an adjacent 24-acre site east of U.S. 27 between Sheridan Street and Stirling Road. CCA bought the land in response to a request for proposals from then-Sheriff Ron Cochran for a county jail for women, said Steve Owen, a CCA spokesman. Cochran died in 1997, and the next sheriff, Ken Jenne, cancelled seeking proposals. But CCA went ahead, believing that another government entity would want to send inmates there if it built a jail. In 2000, Southwest Ranches incorporated as a town, and in 2005 the town signed a deal with CCA to build the facility with the intention that the customer would be the federal government. CCA plans to build a facility for up to 1,500 beds, Owen told PolitiFact in an e-mail. (Some articles and documents cite higher figures, but Owen said an application to increase the number was withdrawn when ICE sought a smaller facility.) The details with ICE are still being worked out but once construction begins, it could be up and running in about 18 months. Once the prison is built and fully occupied, the town stands to earn than $1 million a year in taxes and fees. Pines commission voted multiple times about the prison While Southwest Ranches has been in the driver's seat here -- the town was responsible for approving the agreement with CCA, for example -- Pembroke Pines has played a role. Let's look at the votes that Pines has taken related to the prison project while Ortis has been mayor. For a list of the votes by the Pembroke Pines Commission, we turned to an email sent by Pembroke Pines City Manager Charlie Dodge to commissioners Oct. 5, and we then we turned to the city's minutes when available to verify the votes. Here is a summary of some of the key votes: • Sept. 21, 2005: The commission, along with Ortis, voted unanimously to notify Broward County that it objected to the 1,500-bed jail. But at the time, the town and city were embroiled in some unrelated spats about road lights and barricades the town had set up blocking drivers from Pines from traveling on certain Ranches roads. Pines' objection to the prison appeared to be more of a bargaining chip, because a few months later the city agreed to not fight the prison and the two municipalities reached an agreement on the roads. • December 21, 2005: The commission, along with Ortis, unanimously approved an agreement with Ranches that included language that stated, "The CITY shall not interfere with Corrections Corporation of America, or its successors or assigns, development and/or operation of the jail facility, or with the TOWN’S Agreement with Corrections Corporation of America concerning development of same." • June 27, 2011: The commission, along with Ortis, approved an agreement with the town to provide emergency medical and fire protection in exchange for $2.5 million annually starting Oct. 1. The agreement includes a section that states that "CITY acknowledges that it has sufficient capacity to deliver emergency medical protection and fire prevention services to the TOWN’s future 2,500 bed penal institution/deportation facility, located on property currently owned by the Corrections Corporation of America...." The agreement also states that it has capacity to provide water and sewer. The vote, which included Ortis, was unanimous. • Aug. 17, 2011: Commission, along with Ortis, unanimously approved a motion to begin providing fire service one month earlier than planned: Sept. 1, 2011. (The minutes were not available but city clerk Judy Neugent provided us with a draft copy.) Pines attorney cautions city against trying to stop service to jail site After opposition sparked a fury, Pembroke Pines city commissioners asked their attorney, Sam Goren, to explain if the city had to provide water and sewer to the jail facility after they had already voted to do so. Goren's conclusion: once the city agreed to provide water and sewer it couldn't back away -- the city could face a breach of contract. And, as the Pines lawyers wrote in a follow-up memo Sept. 21, the city already provides water and sewer to the area including to an adjacent women's prison. "The City’s denial of service to one facility while providing service to a similar adjacent facility may place the City in a legally tenuous position," said Goren in the memo. Broward County also played a role in paving the way for the prison. Based on county staff's recommendations, the county commission voted to amend the plat note on Dec. 13, 2005. The amendment changed the plat note from industrial use to a 1,500-bed correctional facility. Ortis responds We asked Ortis why he told the crowd "we don't have a vote in it." Ortis stood by his comments at the meeting and explained that the city of Pembroke Pines doesn't get a vote on whether the jail facility should be built. "It is a Southwest Ranches issue with CCA. They cut the deal, they voted for it, this project was Southwest Ranches. They signed it. We had no signature to it. We don't have a vote in the entity itself. ... We never had a vote to say yea or nay to it," he said. Pembroke Pines did vote to provide fire, water and sewer to the detention center, Ortis said, adding that the city already provides services to a nearby women's prison. "We had a 5-0 (vote) to do that," he said. "In my opinion, the five of us never thought that was a problem. ... Nobody objected to it, no one in the audience was objecting to it." Ortis said he doesn't think the detention facility belongs at that site, but that the decision rested with Southwest Ranches -- not Pines. Our ruling Ortis told the crowd of jail opponents: "Let me just say that the longer I sit at this meeting, the angrier I'm getting," Ortis said. "Many of you who have contacted our office I've told you this is a Southwest Ranches issue. We don't have a vote in it. Let me just finish. We don't have a vote in it. This is what happens when you don't go to the people first." Ortis' comments could have left protesters with the impression that as Pines mayor he didn't get to vote on the project. There is a kernel of a fact here: it was Southwest Ranches -- not Pembroke Pines -- that penned the deal with the prison operator, and Pines didn't get an up or down vote on whether the facility should be built. But it's not as if Pines has been in the dark here. Ortis, along with the rest of the commission, voted to provide services to the prison in 2011. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-03883	Says Texas has the most uninsured people of any state -- 6 million.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/mar/06/garnet-coleman/garnet-coleman-says-texas-has-highest-number-unins/	A Democratic state legislator aired a familiar — and flawed — claim on a Dallas TV station. On the Feb. 10, 2013, edition of WFAA-TV’s "Inside Texas Politics," Rep. Garnet Coleman of Houston, who hopes that Texas follows Florida and other states in opening Medicaid to more people, said: "We have the most uninsured people of any other state; it’s 6 million people." His remark was similar to a recent claim by the editorial board of the Sacramento Bee, which said Texas has the most uninsured residents. We rated that Mostly False after finding that more populous California has more uninsured residents. Drawing on U.S. Census Bureau research, the Kaiser Family Foundation keeps up with how many residents of each state have health coverage. Nationally in 2011, the foundation says, some 16 percent of the population was uninsured. In Texas, the foundation says, 24 percent of residents had no health insurance — and that was the highest uninsured rate for any state. Some 22 percent of Nevada residents and 21 percent of New Mexico residents lacked coverage, according to the foundation, while California and Louisiana were among five states where 20 percent of the population was uninsured. The foundation cites as a basis for these percentages the bureau’s continuing household surveys, which suggest slightly different levels of the uninsured dependent on whether the cited survey is a one-day snapshot or one that encompasses several years. Regardless, Texas has consistently had the highest uninsured rate. Another foundation chart shows, as Coleman said, that Texas had more than 6.1 million uninsured residents in 2011. But California had more, with 7.3 million uninsured, the chart says. California’s population exceeded Texas’ by some 12 million. Separately, we found a lower tally for Californians under age 65 who lack coverage in a December 2012 article by Paul Fronstin of the Washington-based Employee Benefit Research Institute, which says its mission is to enhance the development of sound public policy through objective research and education. A summary of that article opens: "In 2011, California had the largest number of people under age 65 without health insurance — 7.1 million — of any U.S. state. The percentage of uninsured Californians has risen steadily over the past two decades; the state now has the seventh-largest percentage of residents without coverage in the United States." The summary says, though, that the state’s share of uninsured residents should drop as the federal law known as Obamacare takes full effect. By email, Fronstin previously agreed California has more uninsured than Texas, pointing to his own analysis of Census Bureau survey research released in March 2012. Still, he said, 27 percent of Texans under 65 are uninsured, compared with 22 percent of Californians. Finally, we pulled down a bureau chart indicating the number of uninsured in each state from 1999 through 2011. Each of those years, it indicates, California had more uninsured residents than Texas, though the gap narrowed to about 500,000 residents in 2001, 2002 and 2007. California held its biggest edge in 1999 when, the bureau estimates, 6.4 million Golden State residents were uninsured compared to 4.3 million Texans. By email, Coleman conceded that his broadcasted comment was incorrect, saying: "Texas has the second-highest total number of uninsured people, with over 6 million uninsured," which he called dismal. Our ruling Coleman said Texas has the most uninsured residents. Texas continues to have highest percentage of uninsured residents in the nation, but, in raw numbers, California has about 1 million more uninsured residents. Coleman’s claim has an element of truth, yet it’s wrong on the numbers. We rate it Mostly False.	None	Garnet Coleman	None	None	None	2013-03-06T10:00:00	2013-02-10	['None']

And for fiscal year 2011 an $11 billion budget deficit. Her mistakes, along with her partner Jon Corzine."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/apr/28/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-he-entered-office-deficit-bi/	Some claims just never get old for Gov. Chris Christie. Take, for example, the existence of billions of dollars in deficits that awaited the new governor in January 2010, which he has now referenced at least five times. Christie described the burden during the "Ask The Governor" radio program that aired Monday on NJ101.5 FM. "If anyone should know irresponsible it should be Senator Buono. She’s the one, her budget left us with a $2 billion budget deficit in fiscal 10 that I had to fix. Her mistakes. And for fiscal year 2011 an $11 billion budget deficit. Her mistakes, along with her partner Jon Corzine." One legislator - who happens to be running against Christie in November's gubernatorial contest - and one predecessor solely responsible for billions in debt? Nice try, governor, but not entirely accurate. Let’s begin by explaining the budget process. New Jersey operates on a fiscal year beginning July 1 and ending the following June 30. The governor presents a budget, the Legislature reviews it, and the public and nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services offer input. The governor has final approval of the plan and must sign it by July 1. Buono chaired the state Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee and Jon Corzine was governor when the budgets in question were crafted. Now let’s look at both deficits. The first deficit was a $2.2 billion shortfall that existed when Christie took office on Jan. 19, 2010, more than halfway through the fiscal 2010 budget year. Christie fixed it by cutting more than 300 line items in the budget, including $475 million in school aid. The $11 billion deficit was actually a $10.7 billion structural deficit that the OLS projected for the fiscal 2011 budget year. A structural deficit measures how much money the state would need if current services and revenues remained the same, and all required funding obligations are fulfilled. But governors don’t have to keep state spending the same as it ever was. They can change services and approve a spending plan that doesn’t meet funding requirements. That’s what Christie did in the case of the $11 billion deficit: he didn’t fully fund the property tax rebate program or the school-aid formula, and he skipped a more than $3 billion payment into the state’s pension funds. Christie then dismissed structural deficits as "the old way of budgeting," and said New Jersey had switched to zero-based budgeting. Doing so made the $11 billion deficit ‘disappear,’ but the OLS still tracks such debt. Indeed, Christie’s $32.9 billion budget proposal for fiscal year 2014 contains a $3 billion structural deficit. It’s not unusual for governors to not fully fund required or expected costs, according to Raphael Caprio, a professor of Public Administration in the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. The pension fund is one example, he noted. So are Buono and Corzine at fault? "It is true when Christie came into office there was a roughly two billion dollar shortfall that needed to be corrected for during the current budget year and most of the budget year was under the bridge, and so the problem was exacerbated," Caprio said. "It probably was the result of multiple factors created from a perfect storm: we were still in recession, it was an election year, the previous administration probably should have paid closer attention, but it was what it was. "I think it’s probably a little over the top to say that Senator Buono was responsible for the $2 billion shortfall," he added. But Kevin Roberts, a Christie spokesman, said in an e-mail that Buono has frequently taken credit for the budgets in question, "saying her time as budget chair ‘speaks for itself.’" "We couldn't agree more," he said. "As budget chair and architect of Jon Corzine's budgets, Buono has openly and admittedly taken responsible for the policies that were so irresponsibly crafted, they blew a $2.2 billion hole in New Jersey’s deficit that fell to Governor Christie to fix." Buono for Governor spokesman David Turner said Christie is trying to deflect blame for his own "fiscally irresponsible budget gimmicks." "During a time when more than 400,000 people are looking for work, he has raided programs that would create jobs, underfunded our schools and delayed property tax relief for working and middle class families," Turner said in an e-mail. Our ruling Christie said, "If anyone should know irresponsible it should be Senator Buono. She’s the one, her budget left us with a $2 billion budget deficit in fiscal 10 that I had to fix. Her mistakes. And for fiscal year 2011 an $11 billion budget deficit. Her mistakes, along with her partner Jon Corzine." Although the budget is the chief responsibility of the governor, many are responsible for negotiating the document that ultimately becomes the state’s spending blueprint, Caprio said. Buono chaired the senate budget panel for the budgets referenced by Christie, but neither she nor Corzine are completely responsible for the deficits. Many factors were at play.

pomt-08350	In the past two years, Democrats have "spent more money than this country has spent in the last 200 years combined."	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2010/oct/27/eric-cantor/eric-cantor-tells-jon-stewart-us-spent-more-past-t/	During an Oct. 12, 2010, visit to Comedy Central's Daily Show with Jon Stewart, Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va., made a striking statement. "What you've seen (in Washington)," he said, "is a crowd that has taken advantage of a crisis back in late '08, early '09 and spent more money than this country has spent in the last 200 years combined, in the two years since." On the show, Stewart didn't challenge Cantor's claim, but we will. We first turned to historical tables from the Office of Management and Budget. One table, conveniently enough, details federal government spending since the birth of the modern Republic in 1789. We first looked at federal spending for 2009 and the estimate of spending for 2010. Combined, federal spending in those two years amounted to a little more than $7.2 trillion. We didn't have to add up all 200 years -- you only have to add together 2006, 2007 and 2008 to reach $8.3 trillion, which exceeds the $7.2 trillion of 2009 and 2010. So by that measure, Cantor is wrong. Want to use the data for 2010 and 2011 instead, under the assumption President Barack Obama was completely in charge for those budget years? Fine. Using those two years ups the total to a bit under $7.6 trillion. The three years before that by themselves total $9.2 trillion. So Cantor is wrong that way, too. What about using projected spending based on the course set by the Obama Administration and the Democratic Congress? Not even bending the rules to include the period 2009 to 2015 would do it. Outlays for the 2009-2015 period increases the cumulative amount of federal spending to about $27.3 trillion. Exceeding that amount only requires combining the federal spending from 1995 to 2008 -- a period of 14 years, not 200. So he's still wrong. What if Cantor misspoke, substituting "spent more money" for "created more debt"? We did that calculation with the help of a different OMB table. The increase in public federal debt between the end of 2008 and the end of 2010 has been almost $3.5 trillion. But the debt from the nation's birth through the end of 2008 was $5.8 trillion. So Cantor isn't right that way, either. When we asked Cantor's staff about it, they tried to move the goalposts. They told us Cantor was actually referring to the debt that will be added by 2015. That would be $8.2 trillion, which exceeds the $5.8 trillion debt accumulated between the birth of the republic and the end of 2008. (Actually, to make the numbers work, they only need to go as far as 2013, which would be the last budget assembled during President Barack Obama's first term.) But even though this number "works," it's not what Cantor said on the show. He didn't say debt, he said spending. And he said "in the two years since," when his staff later claimed he was actually referring to a seven-year period. Economists we spoke to on the left and the right agreed with our analysis and pointed out a few other problems with Cantor's claim. • Inflation. We used raw dollars, not inflation-adjusted dollars. But since a dollar is worth far less today than it was in the early 1800s, you can't genuinely compare dollar amounts from then to dollar amounts from today without making a mathematical adjustment. But if you did make that adjustment, it would take Cantor's claim even farther from the truth. • How do you assign responsibility for spending increases? As much as Republicans like to blame Obama and the Democratic Congress for the boom in federal spending, a sizable chunk of current spending was set on its course because of actions taken under President George W. Bush and the Republican Congress (such as the Medicare prescription drug benefit). This doesn't mean Obama and the Democratic Congress bear no responsibility for the rise in spending. They just don't deserve all the blame. • Does the comparison actually mean anything? From year to year, the economy grows, and so does population. It's only natural that as the size of the population grows and more money is available to spend, more money will be spent in an absolute sense. A more relevant comparison would be whether spending has grown disproportionately compared to the size of the economy. And as it happens, that would have provided Cantor with a striking statistic. According to OMB, the public debt will have risen from about 40 percent of gross domestic product at the end of 2008 to about 64 percent at the end of 2010 -- an increase by more than half over just a two-year span. But back to his words. He said that in the past two years, Democrats "spent more money than this country has spent in the last 200 years combined." That's wrong no matter how you slice it. And it's not just wrong -- it's ridiculously false. We rate the claim Pants on Fire!

The shootings took place at two sites -- a military recruiting office in a strip mall and a Navy Operational Support Center.

Authorities are investigating the killings but haven’t yet confirmed a terrorist motive. Speaking at a Carson City, Nev., town hall on July 17, Bush said, "A law was passed, apparently in the Clinton administration, about whether, in recruiting offices … Marines or other military should be able to have guns. Apparently it is prohibited." Bush was one of several Republican candidates to call for an end to such a gun prohibition. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, another GOP presidential candidate, also pointed blame at Clinton. Bush’s claim raised two questions for us: Are guns prohibited at recruiting offices? And if so, is that due to a law passed under President Clinton? Policies about guns and the military As it turns out, there is a policy that’s relevant here -- but it’s not as straightforward as Bush suggests, and it wasn’t written under Clinton. It stemmed from an effort under Bush’s father, then-President George H.W. Bush. In 1992, when Bush was president, the Department of Defense issued a directive related to firearms for military personnel. That directive replaced an earlier one from 1986. The directive doesn’t specifically address recruiting offices, but it applies broadly to military sites. The 1992 directive, signed by then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Donald Atwood, didn’t outright ban military personnel from carrying weapons. Instead, it said that only certain employees could carry weapons, including those who worked in law enforcement, security and prisons. The directive also did not apply in certain situations, such as in war zones. The policy explains that the intent is "to limit and control the carrying of firearms by DoD military and civilian personnel." So the policy did cover most military personnel. Those who have opposed this policy have sometimes referred to it as a Clinton-era policy because the Army did release a regulation that implemented the Defense Department directive in March 1993, two months after Clinton took office. (For more on a similar claim that circulated after a mass shooting at the Washington, D.C., Navy Yard, see the fact-checking website Snopes.) A new Defense Department directive issued in April 2011 after a mass shooting at Ft. Hood in Texas tweaked the policy with some new phrases, including that workers have an "inherent right to self-defense." However, the overall policy essentially remained the same. Here is part of that directive: "Arming DoD personnel (i.e., administrative, assessment, or inspection, not regularly engaged in or directly supervising security or law enforcement activities) shall be limited to missions or threats and the immediate need to protect DoD assets or persons’ lives. DoD Components have the discretion to keep designated staff personnel qualified and available or on call to perform duties." The recruiting office where the shooting occurred represented all four branches of the military. We could not reach a spokesperson for the Marines. However Brian Lepley, a spokesman for U.S. Army Recruiting Command, said that "weapons are not permitted in recruiting stations by DoD because there are no law enforcement personnel there." Many on the Internet noted the gun-free sign on the military recruiting office door. "Once you cross that door, you are not allowed to have a weapon in there," Lepley said. The president’s role So should we blame Clinton -- or any president -- for the Department of Defense directive? "No, I wouldn’t," said Richard Brennan, a senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation and a career Army officer. "And frankly I’m unaware of any statute that prevents military personnel from carrying weapons. What there has been at least since 1975 when I was a cadet were policies and regulations that govern the circumstances under which military personnel can carry weapons." Over the years, those policies have consistently said that personnel working as law enforcement and protecting life or federal property can carry firearms. "There hasn’t been marked change in this," he said. While a president could get involved in this level of detail if they wanted to, this is generally settled at a lower pay grade. Such directives are "internally generated by a need seen either within civilian military leadership or military leadership," Brennan said. Typically, they update earlier policies, he added. Steven Bucci, a military expert for the Heritage Foundation and former Army colonel, told PolitiFact that the policy about firearms existed for decades before Clinton, or Bush for that matter. "As far back as when I joined the military in 1973, and probably further back, you have never been able to carry firearms, privately owned or government, on military installations. You always had to register it with the MP's and keep them locked in the arms rooms," he said, referring to military police. Bucci has disputed previous claims that President Clinton "disarmed" the military. "No one ‘disarmed’ the military -- the military itself prefers to manage good order and discipline by not having everyone armed," he told PolitiFact. In the wake of the shooting rampage in Tennessee, several lawmakers have said they plan to introduce bills to get rid of the military directive about firearms. Then-Rep. Steve Stockman, R-Texas, introduced a bill in 2013 to repeal the Defense Department directive and prohibit the military from instituting any restrictions on guns. But it never received a vote. We sent a summary of our findings about the defense directives to a spokeswoman for Bush. She reiterated his viewpoint. "The Clinton administration implemented this policy to prohibit guns in military recruitment offices," said Allie Brandenburger. "Gov. Bush believes military recruiters should be allowed to carry guns." Our ruling Bush said that "a law was passed, apparently in the Clinton administration, about whether, in recruiting offices … Marines or other military should be able to have guns. Apparently it is prohibited." The Department of Defense issued a directive, not a law, in 1992 -- when Bush’s father was president. It did not ban firearms outright; it limited them to military personnel who held certain jobs, such as positions in law enforcement. And while the Army issued a regulation implementing that directive in 1993 -- two months after Clinton was in office -- experts say it is not the sort of matter that would typically rise to the attention of a president. Bush has a point that, for the most part, military personnel can’t have firearms at recruiting offices. But most of everything else he said was incorrect. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-11126	Says Heidi Heitkamp has "never been interested in" regulatory relief "until all of a sudden I become a candidate for the Senate and put pressure on."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jun/04/kevin-cramer/kevin-cramer-distorts-heidi-heitkamps-record-banki/	North Dakota’s candidates for U.S. Senate are sparring over a new banking law they both co-sponsored that rolls back parts of Dodd-Frank, a signature banking regulatory law signed by former President Barack Obama. North Dakota Democrats bragged on Twitter that during the bill’s signing Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat, got a shoutout from President Donald Trump while Rep. Kevin Cramer, a Republican, lurked in the background. Cramer shot back that Heitkamp only discovered an interest in relieving regulations for banks after Cramer applied pressure. "We’ve sent over 40 of these types of bills to the Senate she’s never been interested in, until all of a sudden I become a candidate for the Senate and put pressure," Cramer told conservative radio host Rob Port. "All of a sudden she’s for a little bit of regulatory relief, and when I say little, I mean very little regulatory relief for the banking industry." We were curious: Did Heitkamp’s interest in regulatory relief flower overnight? It’s something other Democrats have criticized her for, so we wondered if it was an election-year stance. A review of the evidence shows that Heitkamp has been working on banking issues since she was elected in 2012. She joined the Senate Banking Committee in 2013. Heitkamp cosponsored the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, the law in question, on Nov. 16, 2017. Cramer announced his candidacy on Feb. 16, 2018. Heitkamp’s office said she has been working on the current law since 2013. She has also held over two dozen Senate Banking Committee hearings since 2015 on financial regulatory reform and over 30 discussions with top financial regulators. Heitkamp cosponsored a bill that was folded into law in 2015 to eliminate annual privacy notifications from banks, which cut red tape for community banks and credit unions. In 2014, Heitkamp also pressed for Obama to take into account community banks when naming a Federal Reserve governor. "During the entirety of (her tenure), she has often expressed a desire for regulatory relief for community banks and credit unions," said Rob Blackwell, editor of American Banker. "The idea that she’s a johnny-come-lately to regulatory reform just doesn’t hold water." Blackwell pointed us to a 2013 profile of Heitkamp that appeared in American Banker: "The North Dakota Democrat has emerged as a key player on the Banking Committee, helping to work on a bipartisan housing finance reform bill and championing legislation to provide relief to small banks," the profile reads. "In doing so, she has impressed bankers in her home state and her fellow legislators with her commitment to financial issues and willingness to work across the political aisle." Cramer’s campaign argued that Heitkamp did not support Cramer’s own House bills that aimed to curb more regulation. But the bills Cramer provided as evidence were more extreme and unlikely to garner Democratic support, Blackwell said. Our ruling Cramer said Heitkamp has "never been interested in" regulatory relief for banks "until all of a sudden I become a candidate for the Senate and put pressure on." Heitkamp has been an advocate of regulatory relief for small banks since she ran for the Senate in 2012. Cramer announced his Senate bid in February. Heitkamp’s lack of support for the regulatory relief that Cramer supports does not mean she is disinterested in regulatory relief. We rate this statement False.

pomt-12592	"Over the past 25 years, job growth in right-to-work states has been twice as high as in non-right-to-work states. ... The facts are just so clear that this is going to lead to more jobs and higher pay for the people of Missouri."	half-true	/missouri/statements/2017/apr/06/eric-greitens/greitens-not-quite-right-right-work/	It took less than a month for Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens to fulfill one of his campaign promises. On Feb. 6, Greitens signed a law making Missouri the 28th right-to-work state, part of his strategy to improve the state’s economic climate. Two days later, in a Fox News interview with Neil Cavuto, the Republican governor touted the effects of the legislation, saying Missouri has joined the ranks of states that have seen a considerable amount of job growth. Greitens said in the interview: "Over the past 25 years, job growth in right-to-work states has been twice as high as in non-right-to-work states. ... The facts are just so clear that this is going to lead to more jobs and higher pay for the people of Missouri." Right-to-work laws prohibit union security agreements, which limit a union’s ability to require employees to join. These contracts can include mandatory fees as a condition of employment. Greitens signed the bill into law on Feb. 6. The law will take effect Aug. 28. Opponents of Missouri’s right-to-work law say it will allow workers declining to pay union fees to reap the benefits of unions, which are required by federal law to protect all workers covered by a contract. Supporters say it will encourage employers to move to the state, thereby creating more jobs. We wondered how Greitens arrived at the statistic that job growth has been growing at a much faster rate in right-to-work states and, furthermore, if there was truly a relationship between job growth and right-to-work laws. The numbers are more complicated Parker Briden, a spokesman for the Missouri governor’s office, directed us to a 2015 article from the Illinois Policy Institute, a conservative, nonprofit think tank in Chicago. The article’s author, Michael Lucci, reported that the job growth in right-to-work states from 1990-2015 was 47 percent, while job growth in non-right-to-work states was 21 percent during the same time period. Using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Lucci calculated the percent change for nonfarm job growth in each state over the time period and placed them into two groups — one right-to-work, the other non-right-to-work. Lucci did not adjust the job numbers for population. Aggregating job growth totals from right-to-work and non-right-to-work states is not as accurate as comparing growth in individual states, according to Gordon Lafer, an associate professor at the University of Oregon and a former senior labor policy adviser for the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Education and Labor. Lafer has written in opposition of right-to-work laws. Lafer said the numbers are being driven by a few high job-growth states. "I would fail a freshman in college for turning that in," he said. "If Bill Gates walks into a bar, everyone there is a millionaire based on the average." An analysis of the data adjusted for population showed that of the eight states that saw more than 10 percent job growth from 1990 to 2015, six had right-to-work laws. On the other hand, a majority of the states that had a decrease in job growth were right-to-work states — nine out of 15. For what it’s worth, a comparison of the unemployment rate between the two groups of states suggests that there has been a smaller percentage of unemployed people in non-right-to-work states over the past few decades. Of the 10 states that had an increase of more than 10 percent in unemployment since 1990, half of those were right-to-work states. Four of the five states with the largest increases in unemployment were right-to-work states — Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina and South Carolina. But none of these numbers actually prove anything about the policy. Every state is governed by so many different factors affecting their economies that it’s difficult to pinpoint one policy as the economic driver using only Bureau of Labor Statistics data. "You’re supposed to say, all other things being equal, what is the effect of this policy?" Lafer said. "Can you prove it’s right-to-work that’s causing it?" Controlling for other factors, two case studies by researchers from the University of Nevada and Claremont McKenna College found mixed results on the economic effects of right-to-work. In a paper published in 2011, the authors wrote that Oklahoma’s right-to-work laws decreased private-sector union membership in the state but had no effect on job growth, per capita income and wages. Their case study on Idaho’s right-to-work laws found an increase in manufacturing jobs, but they had no effect on per capita income. What does affect job growth? What economists know for sure is that two main factors drive job growth — tax rates and education. Lafer said a policy like right-to-work might have been a larger incentive for companies in the 1940s and ’50s, but today the number of people in unions is so low that it doesn’t create the incentive it once did. He said companies today are more interested in moving to states with highly educated workforces, especially states with a large number of workers in STEM-related fields. Last year, 9.7 percent of Missourians were union members, lower than the U.S. average of 10.7 percent. Rik Hafer, a professor of economics in the Plaster School of Business & Entrepreneurship at Lindenwood University, said that it’s important to take many factors into consideration when thinking about whether a policy like right-to-work is actually linked to a state’s job growth. Factors like tourism, geography and culture can play a role in a company’s decision to move to a certain state. But more importantly, Hafer said, job growth is driven by an educated workforce and the individual and corporate taxes the company would face should it decide to move. A policy such as right-to-work might not be the make or break deal for Missouri jobs, but Hafer said it could "increase the chances of gaining new jobs." Right-to-work might play a more important role for cities that span the borders of two states, Hafer said. If a business could move just a few miles over to be in a state with a right-to-work law, it might choose to do so. Our Ruling Greitens said: "Over the past 25 years, job growth in right to work states has been twice as high as in non-right to work states. ... The facts are just so clear that this is going to lead to more jobs and higher pay for the people of Missouri." His information comes from a conservative think tank that had accurate numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics but used them in a way that experts say is unreliable for measuring the effect of a state law on its economy. Greitens used correct numbers but excluded important contextual information that might give someone a different impression of the figures. We rate this claim Half True. Correction: This story was corrected on April 6, 2017, to accurately describe the methodology used in the Illinois Policy Institute’s analysis of job growth in right-to-work and non-right-to-work states. Job growth numbers for states were aggregated, not averaged.	None	Eric Greitens	None	None	None	2017-04-06T11:53:01	2017-02-08	['Missouri']
pomt-03937	"The only time in our history when the debt has been higher than this was the end of World War II."	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2013/feb/20/david-cote/millionaire-honeywell-ceo-david-cote-compares-toda/	One day before President Barack Obama delivered his "State of the Union" address, David Cote, president of Honeywell International and a member of the president’s debt commission, shared his own thoughts. And Cote’s outlook wasn’t quite as rosy. Cote, a New Hampshire native, returned to the Granite State Monday, Feb. 11, in a forum hosted by "Fix the Debt," a nonpartisan campaign to address the nation’s fiscal challenges. "The recession created a huge issue for us," Cote said during the event, held at Saint Anselm College in Manchester. "The only time in our history when the debt has been higher than this was the end of World War II," he said. "When you think about it that way, it puts into perspective the difficulty of what we're dealing with." Now, PolitiFact has checked a lot of claims about the debt and whether the majority of the debt is Obama’s fault. Those typically land on the false end of the Truth-o-Meter. New Hampshire’s junior Senator Kelly Ayotte compared the amount of debt under Obama to the amount accrued under George Bush and got more favorable results. But here, Cote wasn’t lobbing the blame grenade. In hard dollars, there’s little question that the debt is higher than ever before. On Feb.11, the day of the event, the debt stood at $16.49 trillion-- nearly $10 trillion more than 2002 and almost four times as much as ten years before that, according to Treasury records. However, economists rarely use hard dollars to measure the size of the debt. Rather, they compare the debt total to the country’s gross domestic product -- the value of all goods and services produced in the U.S. in a year -- to get a better picture of the true scale of the debt. In his remarks, Cote referenced the debt to GDP ratio several times and it was clear he wasn’t talking about raw dollars. Currently, the $16 trillion debt makes up about 73 percent of GDP, Cote said, citing the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to support his claim. So, does that number rate as the second highest in history? We decided to check the records. As part of its annual Long-Term Budget Outlook, CBO officials list the debt-to-GDP ratio going back to the 1790, the year after the Constitution took effect. That year, the nation held a debt of $71 million, which reflected about 30 percent of GDP, according to budget office records. By way of quick history lesson,"The U.S. was born in debt," wrote Matt Phillips, a reporter for the Atlantic, wrote in a November article, "The Long Story of U.S. Debt, From 1790 to 2011, in 1 Little Chart.". "Where did that debt come from?" Phillips asked. "Well, the Continental Congress, the rough equivalent of the Federal government in revolution-era America, lacked the power to tax. It first tried to pay for stuff by printing money. This currency, known as the Continental, collapsed." The debt ratio rose and fell over the coming years, in line with the wars ongoing at the time. During the Civil War, the ratio rose from 2 percent in 1860, the year before the war began, to 35 percent, a record at the time, in 1865, when the war came to an end. "The public debt surged from about $65 million in 1860 to $2.76 billion in 1866," Phillips wrote, citing CBO figures. "The debt would never get below $900 million again." And, nearly 60 years later, the debt ratio jumped once again during World War I, rising from 3 percent in 1916, the year before the United States entered the war, to 33 percent in 1919, when the war ended. "Often during wartimes, you see both sides of the equation growing," John Harvey, a professor of economics at Texas Christian University, said this week. "It’s a big increase in spending, without question. But, often, it’s a big increase in revenue, as well," said Harvey, who wrote an article, "Why Our Current National Debt is not the Largest in History," last year for Forbes magazine. The debt ratio began to fall once again in the aftermath of World War I. But, in 1929, the stock market crash launched the Great Depression, which then led to increases in government spending under the New Deal, and the debt ratio rose sharply to 44 percent, a record at the time, in 1940. From there, World War II led to unprecedented growth, both in national spending and debt accumulation. By the end of the war, the ratio rose to 106 percent in 1945 and 109 percent in 1946. "American manufacturing made a killing (during the war), but the government debt to pay for everything was huge," Ron Haskins, a senior economic fellow with the Brookings Institution, wrote in an email to The Telegraph. "We paid more than our fair share of war costs as well as post-war costs (like the Marshall Plan)." The debt ratio remained high in the years following the war -- higher than the current 73 percent ratio. By 1951, it dipped to 67 percent, and despite some peaks and valleys over the coming decades, it did not reach the 70 percent threshold again until 2012. "This one isn’t really the wars. These two wars (in Iraq and Afghanistan) were actually pretty small," said Harvey, the TCU economics professor. "More of it is because of the economy," he said. "When the economy is doing poorly, tax revenues go down because there aren’t as many jobs. At the same time, more people are qualifying for welfare and social assistance, so that drives up costs. … That’s what we’re seeing now." Our ruling In hard dollars, it’s not even close. The current $16.49 trillion debt is far larger than at any other point in U.S. history. But, the debt-to-GDP ratio tells a different story. The current ratio, 73 percent, is among the nation’s highest. But, as Cote notes, it still has a ways to go to get to the 106 and 109 percent levels reached during and after World War II. However, Cote was unspecific about comparing today’s debt to the exact end of World War II in August, 1945, or the era following the war. As noted, the debt remained higher for six years after the war than it is today. We rate Cote’s claim Mostly True.	None	David Cote	None	None	None	2013-02-20T20:22:50	2013-02-11	['None']

pomt-14858	"Net immigration from Mexico last year was zero. Fact-check me."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/14/martin-omalley/martin-omalley-net-migration-mexico-was-0-2014/	At the Democratic debate in Des Moines, former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley shared a statistic that he said you would never hear out of one of the leading Republican presidential candidates. "Let’s say it in our debate because you’ll never hear this from that immigrant-bashing carnival barker Donald Trump: The truth of the matter is net immigration from Mexico last year was zero. Fact-check me. Go ahead, check it out," O’Malley said. Challenge accepted. We actually wrote about this back in June when former President Bill Clinton said something similar. When we did that fact-check, we didn’t have the 2014 data yet. So let’s revisit what we found with the addition of the most recent data, which is the crux of O’Malley’s claim. One way to measure net migration -- the number of new arrivals versus the number who leave -- is the count of people living in America who were born in Mexico. The Census Bureau tracks this. We used two sets of numbers from the American Community Survey -- an estimate based on three years of surveys and an estimate based on just the year the survey took place. (For the 2014 data, a three-year estimate is not currently available.) Year Born in Mexico 3-year average estimate (1,000s) 1-year estimate (1,000s) 2014 n/a 11,714 2013 11,604 11,585 2012 11,650 11,563 2011 11,700 11,673 2010 11,642 11,711 Source: American Community Survey According to Census Bureau data, the number of U.S. residents born in Mexico dropped each year from 2010-13. It bounced back up in 2014, but it remains lower than the peak in 2007, said Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. "That is not a small statistical difference, but it's small compared to the days of rapid Mexican immigration from 1994 to 2007," Nowrasteh said. "O'Malley was mostly correct. The population increased but it was small. Mexican immigration certainly isn't surging anymore." The margin of error is large enough that the actual number of Mexican-born people living in America in 2014 could be lower than it was in 2013. Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors reduced immigration, told us back when we looked into Clinton’s claim that the Mexican-born figures are a valid indicator of the overall trend. While there’s a little variation, both estimates show fewer people from 2010 to 2013. "This strongly implies zero net (migration)," Camarota said. Four reasons for the decline Why is migration from Mexico to the United States slowing down? Demographics is possibly the biggest driver. The birth rate in Mexico has fallen steadily since at least 1990 and now stands at 2.2 children per woman. Marc Rosenblum at the Migration Policy Institute said that translates into fewer people coming into the workforce. Rosenblum told us that apprehensions at the border strongly suggest that fewer people are trying to sneak into the country. Data from the U.S. Border Patrol show a drop of more than 50 percent since 2009. It used to be border agents stopped over half a million people coming in from Mexico. Last year, it was about 230,000. More surveillance, stiffer penalties and more barriers at the border have had the intended effect, he said. Other drivers include the hit on the construction industry during the recession. That was a sector that drew many immigrants, and while it has recovered a bit, it is not nearly as robust as it once was. Plus, according to one survey, Mexicans who return to their native country generally find that they make more money than when they left. Our ruling O’Malley said, "Net immigration from Mexico last year was zero. Fact-check me." Census data from 2010 up to 2013 support O’Malley’s point, as the population of people living in America but born in Mexico fell by about 40,000 since 2010. Experts said this is a strong indication of a prevailing trend. That figure actually rose slightly in 2014 -- though remaining significantly lower than the peak number of Mexican-born Americans in 2007. And the 2014 number had a large enough margin of error that it’s possible there was an actual drop from 2013. Other data, including a rapid decline in apprehensions at the border and changing demographics in Mexico add weight to the conclusion that O’Malley’s point is correct. With a caveat that the measurements aren’t perfect, we rate this statement Mostly True.	None	Martin O'Malley	None	None	None	2015-11-14T23:50:06	2015-11-14	['Mexico']
pomt-08765	Rob Portman is "the one who actually sucked the jobs out of the (Mahoning) Valley and sent them to China."	false	/ohio/statements/2010/aug/25/lee-fisher/lee-fisher-says-rob-portman-actually-sucked-jobs-o/	Lee Fisher has stopped tap-dancing around it. Ohio’s Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate used to suggest that his opponent, Rob Portman, played a big role in promoting job-killing free trade agreements. But on July 31 in Youngstown, Fisher ditched the notion that Portman was just a cog in the wheel, conferring new status on his Republican rival: Portman was at the controls of the job-sucking vacuum. "I’m running against Congressman Portman, who was George Bush’s trade advisor," Fisher said while campaigning in the Mahoning Valley. "He’s the one who actually sucked the jobs out of the Valley and sent them to China." With apologies to H. Ross Perot, who famously described the "giant sucking sound" of jobs going abroad, Fisher was getting at the heart of an Ohio campaign issue. He was saying to the voters of the Youngstown region: If you’ve lost your job, as many around here have, blame it squarely on Rob Portman. How can you prove something like that? We asked, and the Fisher campaign provided several statistics and pieces of information, which fit together like this: First, Portman was a Republican member of Congress who voted in 2000 for normalized trade relations with China. That opened the door to more Chinese imports here, and more American exports to China, without the annual reviews of human rights violations that used to be required before Chinese trade could go forward. Next, Portman was President George W. Bush’s trade ambassador from May 2005 to April 2006. And as trade ambassador, Portman supported Bush’s decision in December 2005 to turn down American steel makers who wanted import restrictions against China. The U.S. International Trade Commission, an independent fact-finding panel within the Commerce Department, had recommended the protections because Chinese steel pipe imports were surging into the United States, threatening the domestic pipe industry. But Bush had the ultimate say, and he decided that the potential harm to the United States economy, including to the construction industry, was too great to restrict the Chinese pipe. Portman reiterated that view as well, when asked about the decision by a member of Congress in 2006. Here’s what happened because of these actions, Fisher says. The trade deficit with China went from $162 billion in 2004 to $202 billion in 2005. Furthermore, the trade deficit with China between 2000 and 2008 cost Ohio 91,800 jobs, according to the Economic Policy Institute, or EPI, a labor-affiliated think tank whose work is cited by Fisher. Those job losses, according to EPI, included 5,500 in the 17th Congressional District, which includes most of the Mahoning Valley and a swath of Akron, and 3,300 in the 6th Congressional District, which includes Boardman, just south of Youngstown. In the steel tube and pipe industry alone, 500 jobs were lost in the United States, including some in Mahoning Valley plants, because of trade abuses by China, according to a Plain Dealer story in 2008 that Fisher’s aides cited. Fisher’s trade deficit figures, provided by the Census Bureau, are good, although they do not specifically measure the trade imbalance in the Mahoning Valley. That would be impossible to measure because thorough import data is not available at the local level. But numbers for the other side of the ledger, exports, are available at the local level. From 2005 to 2006, while Portman was trade ambassador, the value of exports from the Youngstown-Warren-Boardman metropolitan area rose by 10.7 percent, to $1.25 billion, according to Commerce Department data we reviewed independently of the Fisher and Portman campaigns. Exports from the Youngstown metro area rose by only 2 percent the following year, but by 2008 they had jumped by another 14 percent, Commerce figures show. So if you were viewing only exports, you might say that trade deals helped the Youngstown area. But several experts, as well as economic data, suggest that exports were hardly enough to compensate for job losses. In fact, if any place in America has faced tough times, it is the Mahoning Valley. In 2000, there were 224,200 private-sector jobs in the Youngstown metro market. By the end of last year, there were 187,800, a 16 percent drop over the decade, according to figures we reviewed from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The biggest hits have been in heavy manufacturing, including the once-dominant steel industry, and with those hits came losses in the service industries that supported communities, according to Robert E. Scott, a senior international economist at EPI. The Mahoning Valley’s economic decline began in the 1970s with steel imports from Japan, says John Russo, director of labor studies and co-director of the Center for Working-Class Studies at Youngstown State University. But China picked up the mantle later, and foreign trade has absolutely created a drag on the economy, Russo says. There’s no disputing that since 2000, things in the valley have gotten worse. So we also won’t quibble here with EPI’s figures for trade-related job losses, partly because no one else has come up with an accurate measurement. But EPI’s numbers are actually an "estimate of labor displacement," the think tank says, or an extrapolation drawn from employment statistics, census data and trade data. The figures, EPI says, seek to measure the result of the trade imbalance regardless of its causes, which include dumping of cheaper products in this country, price controls in foreign countries, steep tariffs to U.S. products abroad, and currency manipulation by China. We are leery for a different reason, however, of using the EPI numbers to support Fisher’s claim. EPI’s figures include eight years of job losses, and Portman was trade ambassador for only 11 months. Although he was in Congress before joining the White House, Portman was one of 237 House members to vote for trade with China, and the measure passed by a margin of 40 votes. Then-President Bill Clinton fought to get that result, yet Fisher is not blaming Clinton – or Portman’s 163 Republican and 73 Democratic colleagues who also voted for passage in the House -- for sucking jobs out of the Mahoning Valley. We admit, the bar here for Fisher is high. That’s because Fisher said that Portman is "the one" who caused the jobs to go away. Is Fisher’s claim fair? "To the extent that he failed to deal with these things, he contributed to the problem," said Scott, of EPI. We put the same question to Russo at Youngstown State, and he said Fisher’s statement could be considered partly true. You could blame Portman, he said, and Bush, and former and successive trade ambassadors, and corporate CEOs, and China for manipulating its currency and raising barriers to U.S. exports, and Treasury secretaries, and anybody else who has been involved in Chinese manufacturing and trade policy. The list goes on and on, Russo says, and includes members of both parties who have failed to develop a real strategy for dealing with manufacturing. By the same token, Fisher was state development director during some of the worst job losses, in charge of retaining Ohio jobs and attracting new ones. Using Labor Department data, we determined that the Youngstown metro area shed 16,900 jobs -- an 8.25 percent loss -- during the time Fisher led the state’s job retention efforts. Was Fisher "the one" responsible for those losses? We’re not contending that. Rather, we’re raising the point because the economic forces that caused the entire region to fall are beyond any single person – even a candidate for Senate. So we go back to Fisher’s words: "He’s the one who actually sucked the jobs out of the Valley and sent them to China." That’s a big responsibility for one man, even if he was trade ambassador for 11 months. Too big, we think. That’s why we rate Fisher’s claim False. Comment on this item.

The notion that emissions never fell under the Howard government is shown in the advertisement itself to be inaccurate. It is also inaccurate when earlier years of the Howard government are included. The idea that emissions only rise under Liberal governments is disproved by more recent data about emissions under the Rudd-Gillard government that was available when the advertisement was published, and by emissions data under the Hawke-Keating government. Since 1990, emissions rose in 9 of the 13 years the Liberals were in government, compared with three of the 12 years Labor held government. Experts say that with the exception of the carbon tax, factors outside federal government policy have had more of an impact on carbon emissions.

pomt-02187	"My Treasury team eliminated a 900-case backlog in the Crime Victim Compensation Program."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/apr/27/gina-raimondo/raimondo-touts-having-cleared-900-claims-backlogge/	As a candidate for governor, state General Treasurer Gina Raimondo has been touting her experience in the venture capital business as an asset when it comes to running the treasurer’s office, and possibly the rest of state government. On her campaign website, under the headline "Making Government Work," she says she implemented a strategy to streamline management in her office. As evidence, she claims that under her tenure, the treasurer’s office cleared a 900-claim backlog in the state Crime Victim Compensation Program that had been building up for years. She makes a similar claim on the treasurer’s website. We decided to check her claim on those claims. The Crime Victim Compensation Program pays grants to Rhode Island crime victims or their family members. Awards can be used to help pay for expenses such as health insurance deductibles, medical care, lost wages, mental health therapy, crime scene cleanup or funeral costs. Individual victims often file more than one claim, but the maximum amount any one person can receive is $25,000. Most of the program’s money comes from fines and assessments levied in the state courts, augmented by federal funds. When we asked Raimondo’s office for backup, her staff provided a breakdown of the unresolved claim backlog that they said they found after sorting through the compensation program’s files when she took office in 2011. It comprised 912 claims by 415 people. The names of the individuals and the doctors or health care providers who were paid were redacted from the documents we received. Treasurer’s office spokeswoman Joy Fox said fund staffers began going through the paperwork in the files around the middle of 2011, finishing around November. During that time they found instances in which claims had been filed but not decided, and others in which claims had been approved but not paid. The accounting listed the date that each backlogged claim was filed, how much was sought, when it was approved or denied, how much was awarded if it had been approved, when the check was issued and the check number. The earliest claim went back to 2007. After the list was compiled, Fox said the effort to resolve them began in January 2012. According to the payment accounting from Raimondo’s office, by June of 2012 about 95 percent of the claims had resolved. The remainder, 47 claims, were finished by December 2012. Since then, the average wait time for a new claim to be resolved is 28.9 days, the treasurer’s office said in its 2013 annual report on the program to the General Assembly. Of the 912 claims, 391 were approved for some kind of award, about 43 percent. The total amount paid out on those came to $681,890.67. We wanted to find independent verification of that figure. So we went to the treasurer’s office online "transparency portal," which lists the checks issued by the state in given fiscal years. We looked for the 391 checks on the backlog list and found 310 matches -- enough to give us confidence in Raimondo’s figure. Fox said the rest don’t show individually on the transparency portal because the state consolidates multiple payments to single health care service providers into a single combined number for each payee. Our ruling Gina Raimondo said her office was able to resolve 900 pending claims from the state’s Crime Victim Compensation Program since she became general treasurer in 2011. Her staff provided an accounting that outlined the effort. It showed 912 claims resolved, 12 more than she said. We independently verified enough of the claims to rule her statement True.

pomt-12985	"The causation standard in Indiana is exactly the same as it is in Illinois."	true	/illinois/statements/2016/dec/19/david-menchetti/illinois-indiana-work-comp-law-same-words-differen/	One of the hottest and most divisive topics in Illinois politics for the last 18 months has been workers’ compensation reform. Gov. Bruce Rauner and business groups say the state’s workers’ compensation system is unfairly biased against employers and has led, in the most recent national report, to Illinois having the eighth highest workers’ compensation insurance rates in the nation. Two dominant themes have emerged in the workers’ compensation debate. One is that Indiana has been a magnet for Illinois business relocations because it has very low workers’ compensation insurance rates. The other is that Illinois has high rates because of the state’s "no-fault" workers’ compensation system. Any injury "arising out of and in the course of employment" is compensable with workers’ compensation benefits, including medical care and paid time off for recovery. In legal terms, Illinois has no-fault standard of "causation." Thus, a pre-existing condition that is aggravated in the course of work is covered under workers’ compensation. Given all this, a statement made during an Illinois House committee hearing on a workers’ compensation reform bill might have struck an odd chord. "The causation standard in Indiana is exactly the same as it is in Illinois," said David Menchetti, a labor attorney with the Chicago firm Cullen Haskins Nicholson Menchetti. Menchetti testified at the hearing in opposition to the bill, which would change Illinois’ causation standard to the one described in Rauner’s reform agenda. If Indiana is attracting businesses away from Illinois because of its low workers’ compensation insurance premiums, and if Illinois’ no-fault causation standard is the cause of its high insurance rates, could Indiana really have the same legal standard as Illinois? We decided to check. Turnaround Rauner’s Turnaround Agenda contains a section devoted solely to enhancing the state’s causation standard, and he has spoken extensively about the need to switch to a standard in which workers’ compensation benefits aren’t granted unless the workplace is "more than 50 percent responsible for the injury compared to all other causes." He’s also been vocal about Illinois losing jobs and businesses to Indiana because of, among other things, Illinois’ high workers’ compensation insurance premiums. "We should be kickin’ tails, and look what’s happening to us," Rauner said in a speech in August at the Illinois State Fair. "Our jobs are going to Indiana. Come on. They’re going to Indiana. They ain’t going there for the weather." Rauner is not the first to invoke the state’s causation standard as problematic for businesses. In a 2012 brief, Attorney General Lisa Madigan wrote, "To protect taxpayer dollars, the legislature must address and change the causation standard that is currently applied by the IWCC and the courts." The attorney general’s office, however, has never advocated for a specific standard and has not issued an official opinion on Rauner’s proposal. "From our perspective, there ought to be reasonable ways to change the standard that would not damage the purpose of workers’ compensation to ensure that employees who are injured on the job can fully recover," Madigan’s chief of staff, Anne Spillane, told Politifact Illinois in September. The codes The Illinois Workers’ Compensation Act invokes the term "arising from and in the course of" employment seven times in defining injuries subject to workers’ compensation. Likewise, the Indiana Workers’ Compensation code (ICC 22-3-6-1-[e]) defines "injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment" as compensable under the state’s workers’ compensation system. By contrast, Florida -- whose causation standard Rauner wants to replicate in Illinois -- adds a conditional clause in its code: "If an injury arising out of and in the course of employment combines with a preexisting disease or condition to cause or prolong disability or need for treatment, the employer must pay compensation or benefits required by this chapter only to the extent that the injury arising out of and in the course of employment is and remains more than 50 percent responsible for the injury as compared to all other causes combined and thereafter remains the major contributing cause of the disability or need for treatment. Major contributing cause must be demonstrated by medical evidence only." (440.09 [b]) But if Indiana and Illinois have identical causation standards in their workers’ compensation statutes, why are Indiana’s insurance premiums so much cheaper than those paid by businesses in Illinois? Menchetti cites two primary reasons. One is that Indiana pays significantly lower workers’ compensation benefits. The other, he says, is that employers in Indiana, not injured employees, have first choice in medical treatment. A national compilation of workers’ compensation laws by the Workers’ Compensation Research Institute confirms that the initial choice of treating physician in Indiana lies with the employer, while in Illinois the choice is the employee. A 2015 report by nonprofit, investigative journalism website ProPublica shows that, on benefits for permanent partial disability, Illinois consistently paid more than the national average while Indiana generally was close to average. (Compensation for loss of an arm in Illinois, for example, is $439,858. The national average is $169,878, and Indiana pays $202,050.) More than just causation While the statutes in Indiana and Illinois may use the same definition for causation, how the law is interpreted and applied makes the difference on cost, says Michael Lucci, who has studied workers’ compensation and written extensively about it for the libertarian Illinois Policy Institute, which favors Rauner’s reform agenda. "I think the difference you’ll find is largely subject to judicial interpretation and arbitration rulings," Lucci says. "Causation is a difficult issue. We haven’t engaged particularly hard on this issue." In a recent analysis, Lucci offered a seven-point plan for reducing Illinois’ workers’ compensation insurance premiums. Changing the causation standard was not among them. The difference between eighth-most-expensive Illinois and second-least-expensive Indiana for workers’ compensation insurance, Lucci says, can’t be bridged by changing the causation wording alone. "Their arbitrators have a narrower view of what constitutes a workplace injury," Lucci says. Our ruling Attorney David Menchetti testified before the Illinois House Labor and Commerce Committee that, "The causation standard in Indiana is exactly the same as it is in Illinois." State workers’ compensation statutes in both states confirm that Indiana and Illinois both are "no-fault" states in which an injury need only happen in the workplace to be covered by workers’ compensation. Both define qualifying injuries as those as those arising from employment with no other conditions. As noted in statements from Menchetti and Lucci -- who are on opposite sides of the larger workers’ compensation reform issue -- the causation standard’s effect on workers’ compensation insurance rates is open to debate. The standard itself in Illinois and Indiana statutes is not. We rate this statement True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/94311f61-1859-49ec-bb92-3464f6214170	None	David Menchetti	None	None	None	2016-12-19T17:19:09	2016-11-28	['Illinois', 'Indiana']

pomt-05243	Says "city leadership is threatening to lay off police and emergency services personnel to balance the budget."	false	/tennessee/statements/2012/jun/03/memphis-police-association/memphis-police-union-says-mayor-wharton-threatened/	At a recent meeting with The Commercial Appeal editorial board, Memphis Mayor A C Wharton showed a side to his personality seldom seen in his many years of public service -- anger. The subject -- commercials being aired by the Memphis Police Association, the union representing Memphis’s police officers. The ads claim the city’s "leadership" has used city tax money and offered tax breaks to companies like Mitsubishi and Electrolux, and then warns that "city leadership is threatening to lay off police and emergency services personnel to balance the budget." Wharton said he had been seeing the ads running "24-7" and that "it really irks me." Coming from Wharton, whose reputation for a calm demeanor goes back to his days as one of the area’s most esteemed courtroom lawyers, that qualifies as a tirade. So we decided to take a closer look at the charges. The commercial is part of a larger campaign by the MPA called "Wake Up, Memphis!" that includes a dedicated home on the MPA website and handouts. In an appearance with Fox 13 News, MPA president Mike Williams said, "It’s not our intention to irk the mayor off." But did the union go too far in its criticism? Wharton has consistently said, since winning a special election in 2009, that he would do everything possible to avoid cuts in public safety. Mayoral spokeswoman Mary Cashiola wrote in an email: "In the budgets he has presented, laying off fire and police personnel has never been submitted, planned, or agreed to at any level." In an email response, MPA vice president Essica Littlejohn confirmed that by "city leadership," the MPA was referring to Wharton, providing links to two TV news reports featuring interviews with the mayor. She names Wharton specifically and says that he "expressed that police and fire would not be exempt from layoffs as in years past, although that option would be a last resort. It is our belief that Mayor Wharton planted the seed of police and fire layoffs to soften the blow regarding the need for a property tax increase. So to answer your question, yes, there were definitely threats made to lay off police and fire personnel." One of the TV reports, from WPTY’s ABC 24, does indeed lead with this sentence: "Mayor A C Wharton is considering police and fire department layoffs in Memphis as he prepares to present his budget ideas to city council members next week." Another, from WMC’s Action News 5, has this headline: "Memphis police, firefighters could face layoffs." The station even used this wording in the web address to try to attract the attention of search engines like Google: "police-and-firemen-now-included-in-city-layoffs." So, case closed, right? Not exactly, at least when you look at what the mayor said rather than how the TV stations teased the pieces to entice viewers. Wharton told ABC 24: "I made it a cardinal principle we would not take any boots off the street. But things are so challenging now, I'm not going to rule out anything. Obviously that would be my last resort." This is what Wharton told Action News 5: "I'm not saying yes, I'm not saying no. I'm simply saying that when we go before the council, we will have looked at everything." He also said, "For the whole time I've been in office, that's the first thing we want to protect." The mayor’s spokeswoman, Cashiola, contends that "the Mayor’s statement about it being a last resort shouldn’t be taken as a threat but an indicator of something he did not plan to do. Calling those layoffs a last resort means just that – everything else would be tried before public safety would even receive the slightest consideration." The budget the mayor presented, in fact, not only did not propose layoffs for public safety personnel but in fact proposed an overall increase in spending on public safety. Memphis Fire Department director Alvin Benson even said that there will be hiring to replace employees lost through attrition. Despite that, the commercials continued to run and remain highlighted on the MPA’s website. Our ruling In trying to influence the Memphis budget hearings, the Memphis Police Association ran commercials claiming that a mayor who still has never proposed cuts in public safety areas was "threatening to lay off police and emergency services personnel to balance the budget." Though the mayor said he was "not going to rule out anything" he never said there were serious plans to lay off cops or emergency services personnel. In fact, he said such moves would be a "last resort" and the budget he eventually proposed calls for increased spending on public safety. We therefore rule the police union’s statement False.

pomt-15342	Wisconsin’s economy has "tanked" under Gov. Scott Walker and "so far in 2015 over 6,685 people have been laid off, already more than in all of 2014."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jul/10/american-bridge-21st-century/american-bridge-21st-century-says-layoffs-show-eco/	Job creation was the No. 1 issue for Republican Scott Walker in his first term as Wisconsin governor, and the state’s economic performance will be examined in depth as his presidential campaign gets underway. The left-leaning American Bridge 21st Century tried to kick-start that conversation with a blog post July 1, 2015 that carried this headline: "Walker’s economy gets worse." The item said: "Scott Walker’s Wisconsin: So far in 2015 over 6,685 people have been laid off, already more than in all of 2014." It continued: "How much has Scott Walker tanked Wisconsin’s economy? In addition to having the slowest job growth in the Midwest, Wisconsin layoff notices just passed the total layoffs in all of 2014 and are set to be the highest of Walker’s tenure by 4,000." That’s a lot of baggage to unpack. We have done numerous items about Scott Walker and jobs, this is the first about layoffs. Is the group right that layoffs for 2015 have surpassed those in 2014, and that the situation is evidence the economy has "tanked"? How the system works In Wisconsin, businesses are required to file warning notices with the state when they anticipate ending employment for more than 50 workers. Wisconsin’s law is more strict than federal law, which requires notices for layoffs of more than 100 workers. As part of its claim, American Bridge linked to a June 30, 2015 report by WKOW-TV in Madison, which compared the number of people covered by layoff warning notices received by the state so far in 2015 with those for all of 2014. When we looked at the state Department of Workforce Development web site, we could not find the same numbers, but did see the same trend. As of July 8, 2015, the tally for 2015 was 8,627, compared with 7,239 in all of 2014. But the warning notices are a lousy tool to assess the economy -- and especially employment. Why? Some layoffs never trigger a notice, because they don’t reach the 50 person threshold. Also, the notices don’t always mean lost jobs. In cases when a company changes hands, the old firm is required to file a notice, even if all the workers will retain their jobs with the new firm. So it is wrong to equate the notices with bodies out the door, as American Bridge did. The "data is interesting, but not very useful," said Brian Jacobsen, an economist at Wells Fargo and a professor at Wisconsin Lutheran College. "If you think about the number of employees affected, it's relatively small." Jacobsen noted layoffs are sometimes announced and then phased in over a number of years. "Thankfully, some of those notices change, resulting in fewer employees being affected," he said. "Some employers may err on the side of giving a warning even if there is a chance the layoffs won't occur." Another factor that the layoff notices don’t reflect is the number of jobs that have been added to the economy. Based on the most solid numbers available, through the first four months of 2015, state private sector employers added 13,300 jobs. That compares with 10,600 jobs in the same time frame in 2014. (Numbers for May are preliminary) Other indicators also suggest more of an upswing rather than a tumble. -- The Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce economic trends report from July 1, 2015. "Currently the metro area’s economic environment is marked by a solid majority of indicators in aggregate pointing upward, led largely by an improving job situation," said Bret Mayborne, the MMAC’s economic research director. "In addition, local housing and real estate indicators have been contributing to this growth trend over the past nine months." -- The most recent quarterly survey by ManpowerGroup Inc. Issued June 8, 2015, the report said employers in Wisconsin as well as the Milwaukee metro area expect "bullish" and "prosperous" hiring prospects in the coming quarter. Our rating American Bridge 21st Century says that Wisconsin’s economy tanked under Scott Walker and uses layoff notices filed with the state as evidence. But the notices do not represent bodies out the door and, though higher than last year, they are not a reliable economic indicator. Indeed, other reports say that employers overall added about 13,000 jobs in the first five months of the year, a pace higher than a year ago. We rate the claim False. (Editor's note: The paragraph about 2015 job totals was edited for clarity, to reflect the figure is for the first four months of 2015 -- the ones for which final monthly numbers are available.

pomt-04314	Says Maggie Hassan pays zero property taxes on her $500,000 home.	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/oct/29/republican-governors-association/republican-governors-association-tv-ad-says-democr/	It has become the most recognizable building in the race for governor -- the colonial residence in Exeter, N.H. of Democratic candidate Maggie Hassan. Hassan’s abode was a topic whispered about by the campaign of her rival Ovide Lamontagne for months but it wasn’t until the Republican Governors Association released an ad three weeks before the Nov. 6 election that it became water-cooler conversation. "This is Maggie Hassan's half-million dollar home, a half-million dollar home that Hassan pays no property taxes on, zero property taxes," the narrator in the ad titled "Zero" declares. The ad goes on to charge that when Hassan was the majority leader of the state Senate "she pushed 33 tax and fee increases for the rest of us on top of our property taxes." "Maggie Hassan believes in higher taxes, just not for herself," the ad concludes. PolitFact New Hampshire decided to examine the accuracy of this claim that in the closing weeks of this tight race has sparked plenty of controversy, including several requests by PolitiFact readers to check the ad. The ad is part of the RGA's $5.8 million television advertising buy since the Sept. 11 primary, all spent on attacks against Hassan to benefit Republican Lamontagne. Since the day the ad was released Hassan said it was misleading because it fails to mention that she and her husband, Tom, don't own the home. They live in it because he's the principal of Phillips Exeter Academy, one of the country's most exclusive prep schools in the country. Hassan's camp maintains the ad tries to give the impression that she is a property tax scofflaw when in fact she's not. Five days after the RGA ad came out, the Hassan campaign came back with its own ad titled "Action," which opens with the same image of the home and explains the school ownership. Undeterred, the RGA through its Live Free PAC put up a second commercial titled "Hiding" with Hassan's home on it, and went back to the well. "Maggie Hassan admits she pays zero property taxes on her half-million dollar home," it declares. "Maggie Hassan pays no property taxes, but she likes high taxes for us." RGA Communications Director Michael Schrimpf said his group's researchers went through property assessment records in Exeter and found out the Hassans paid no property taxes. Phillips Exeter officials confirmed that Tom Hassan's contract requires that he live on campus in this home and that it be open and available for many school functions. The home is valued at $545,900 by the town and is one of the school’s tax-exempt properties. If someone was paying taxes on it, the bill would be about $12,350 a year. Private school property is tax-exempt on buildings used for instruction or administration. The Hassan residence qualifies under administration because the principal lives there. School officials listed the property on its tax-exempt application and the town approved. Phillips Exeter Director of Communications Julie Quinn said the private school is still the largest property taxpayer in town paying $772,946 a year on parcels that are not tax-exempt such as dining halls and dormitories. On top of claiming Hassan pays no property taxes, the RGA ad also declares Hassan likes taxing everybody else. As PolitiFact noted in a previous checkon a Lamontagne claim that Hassan was a big spender during her time in office from 2004-2010, total state spending went up by 20 percent during that period. But looking at funds spent from state taxes and fees, spending actually went down, since the Democrats twice reopened the budget to make cuts. It’s also true that when the 2010-11 state budget was out of balance, Gov. John Lynch and the Legislature, including Hassan, approved two bills that included revenue-raising taxes and fees that totaled more than $260 million. Our ruling: While it's true the Hassans pay no property taxes, it’s for good reason. She does not own the home she lives in. It’s owned by Phillips Exeter Academy where her husband Tom is principal and he is required to live in the home. The building is one of the school’s tax exempt properties, but Phillips Exeter is still the town’s largest taxpayer. The ad by the Republican Governor’s Association gives the impression that she's evading her own taxes while supporting increased taxes "for the rest of us." The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this claim to be Mostly False.

pomt-13930	Says Hillary Clinton’s "State Department blocked investigation into Orlando killer’s mosque."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/23/blog-posting/websites-say-hillary-clintons-state-department-blo/	The deadly nightclub attack in Orlando, Fla., has given rise to dozens of theories and explanations as to what happened and how it could have been stopped. One angle gaining traction in social media is that Hillary Clinton’s State Department enabled the attacker, U.S.-born Omar Mateen, 29, by blocking an investigation into a Florida mosque Mateen attended. Mateen killed 49 people and injured more than 50 in an Orlando nightclub June 12. The conspiracy-minded website InfoWars posted an article with the headline, "Hillary’s State Dept. Blocked Investigation into Orlando Killer’s Mosque" on Monday, June 13. Other websites, such as The Horn News, teased a story as "Hillary’s shocking link to Orlando massacre," while Conservative County said Clinton’s link to the Orlando shooter "has been exposed." Collectively, they have been shared at least thousands of times. Is there any truth to these claims? Not according to experts. The claim The InfoWars article centers on the Fort Pierce Islamic Center that Mateen attended. The article claims the mosque under investigation by the FBI and Department of Homeland Security in 2011, but that the investigation was shut down "under pressure from the Clinton-ran State Dept. and DHS’s Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Office out of fear of offending Muslims." The InfoWars story seems to be taken directly from another right-wing website World Net Daily. But that article paints a different picture of the investigation. Both articles are based on the account of Philip Haney, a former Homeland Security agent who says he was assigned to a unit that investigated individuals with potential links to terrorism. He wrote a book published in 2016 called See Something Say Nothing: A Homeland Security Officers Exposes the Government's Submission to Jihad. Haney described investigating an Islamic movement known as the Tablighi Jamaat (misspelled in the InfoWars article). That movement was connected to the Institute of Islamic Education, which is connected to the Darul Uloom Chicago madrassa, which has links to the Sharia Board of America. Haney said he found the Sharia Board of America also had links to the Fort Pierce Islamic Center. In other words, the 2011 investigation Haney described didn’t look directly into Mateen’s mosque, like the InfoWars headline makes it seem. This isn’t the first time Haney has made a connection like this. After the San Bernardino shootings, Haney made the same claim when speaking to Megyn Kelly on Fox News and in a column he wrote in The Hill in February. "The two San Bernardino jihadists, Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik, may have benefited from the administration’s closure of an investigation I initiated on numerous groups infiltrating radicalized individuals into this country," Haney wrote in an article on The Hill. We tried to reach Haney through his phone and also reached out to his book’s publishing company. He could not be reached in either attempt. The truth of the matter So that’s the story, and it relies almost entirely on one person’s account. One of the first holes in the InfoWars article is the misleading headline. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and an adjunct assistant professor in Georgetown University's security studies program, said the headline is wrong and noted InfoWars misinterpreted the information that was taken from World Net Daily. "It’s obviously wrong," Gartenstein-Ross said of the InfoWars headline. "Although, if (InfoWars) changed some words in the headline, it would match their source (World Net Daily). Then there’s a further question if it’s accurate or not." He said that the State Department could not block a case, but it’s possible it asserted pressure. Other experts we reached out to agreed that the InfoWars article doesn’t add up, or at least not in the specifics Haney mentions. The FBI has jurisdiction over domestic terrorism investigations, not Homeland Security, for which Haney worked, said Timothy Edgar, a senior fellow in international and public affairs at the Watson Institute. While Homeland Security does have a "relatively small" intelligence organization known as the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, Edgar said, the office has no jurisdiction to collect information or investigate cases. Point being, Haney likely wouldn’t be in a position at Homeland Security to investigate a terrorism case in the first place. Perhaps the bigger problem with the claim made in the article is the way it characterizes the State Department’s role in investigations. First, the FBI doesn’t investigate entire communities like a mosque, Edgar said. It investigates specific people suspected of terrorist activity. More importantly, the State Department "has no authority or involvement in decisions by the FBI to conduct or close investigations," Edgar said. "It is simply not credible to describe a mosque as being under ‘FBI and DHS’ investigation, or that this activity was halted by the State Department or by the DHS Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties," Edgar said. The State Department’s focus is on operations overseas, said Martin Reardon, who is the senior vice president of the Soufan Group and a 21-year veteran of the FBI. The secretary of state would have no say in domestic FBI cases, or even have an interest in activities inside the United States. Furthermore, FBI agents have to go through a number of channels before a case is closed. It’s not just shut down. And even then, agents are sometimes told to do more work to assure the investigation was done properly, Reardon said. Our ruling Articles claimed that Clinton as secretary of state enabled radical Islamists by shutting down an investigation of Mateen’s Florida mosque. The claim relies heavily on one account of a retired Department of Homeland Security agent that has not been corroborated by any additional source. Experts we talked to say the claims of the investigation and the purported link to Clinton and the State Department is unlikely. The FBI, not Haney’s Homeland Security department, would handle a terrorism investigation. The State Department, meanwhile, would play little to no role in whether a case is opened, closed or anything else. We rate this claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/686b3f34-b0bc-4551-9ae4-35394e6f9783	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2016-06-23T09:56:02	2016-06-13	['United_States_Department_of_State', 'Orlando,_Florida']
pomt-03358	Says "excise taxes are...disproportionately burdening middle- and lower-income consumers."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/jul/16/david-sutton/spokesman-takes-obama-cigarette-tax-idea/	President Barack Obama’s proposal to increase cigarette taxes to help fund pre-kindergarten programs is not getting good grades from some political and business leaders. A spokesman for Altria, the parent company of tobacco giant Philip Morris, offered a rationale for his opposition in a recent Atlanta Journal-Constitution article. His comments made us curious. "We think it is patently unfair to single out adult tobacco consumers with another federal tobacco tax increase to pay for a broad, new government spending program claimed to have benefits for everyone," said the spokesman, David Sutton. "Moreover, excise taxes are regressive, disproportionately burdening middle and lower-income consumers — the very same consumers who have already endured five years of a stagnant economy and high unemployment." It’s frequently said that excise taxes have a great impact on the poor. But as we’ve learned since the Truth-O-Meter started spinning here in 2010 that what’s often said isn’t always correct. We wondered whether Sutton is accurate to claim that excise taxes are "disproportionately burdening middle and lower-income consumers." Excise taxes are special taxes on the purchase of items such as gasoline, alcoholic beverages and tobacco products. They are usually fixed amounts per item, rather than percentages of the price. Obama has discussed raising federal taxes on cigarettes by nearly $1 a pack. By some estimates, approximately three of 10 low-income Americans are smokers. Some people, like New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, believe raising taxes on cigarettes can discourage smoking. Bloomberg made that argument in 2002 when he tried to increase taxes on cigarettes. "You raise it, consumption goes down," Bloomberg said, according to a citizen website that opposes what it called "smoker harassment." Most research we found showed the mayor is generally right, but consumption doesn’t decline as much as anti-smoking advocates would like. The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in one study that a 10 percent increase in cigarette prices is estimated to reduce overall consumption by 4 percent. Other studies say the ratio is more like a 1 percent decrease in consumption for every 1 percent increase in price. The CDC report says a larger percentage of low-income smokers quit once prices rise, but that those who decide to continue smoking are disproportionately impacted by increases in excise taxes. "Cigarette excise taxes increase the purchase price of cigarettes and can pose a disproportionate economic burden on lower socioeconomic populations," the report said. "However, because low-income groups are more responsive to price increases, increasing the real price of cigarettes can reduce cigarette consumption among low-income smokers by a greater percentage than among higher-income smokers." One group of researchers recently examined this issue in New York, breaking down the lowest income group as those with an annual salary of less than $30,000. The widely reported study, released in September, was funded by the New York State Department of Health. The researchers examined the changes from 2003-2004 to 2010-2011 as New York’s cigarette excise tax increased from $1.50 to $4.35. The percentage of income spent on cigarettes for all smokers nearly doubled, from 6.3 percent to 12 percent. For those classified as low-income, it doubled from 11.6 percent to 23.6 percent. "Someone making $20,000 or $30,000 who smokes a pack a day is going to spend a much higher proportion of their income than someone who makes a higher salary," said the lead researcher, Matthew Farrelly, chief scientist at RTI International, a nonpartisan, nonprofit research institute based in North Carolina. But Farrelly, who has written more than 80 research papers on tobacco use since 1998, said the impact for some low-income smokers can be "non-regressive, or progressive" when money from these tax increases goes to programs that help some smokers quit. Despite the tax increase, the study found that the percentage of low-income smokers who quit lighting up barely declined. But Farrelly said that may be because some smokers are circumventing the higher taxes by buying cigarettes illegally, online or in other states with lower excise taxes. He and his team noted that tax-paid cigarette sales captured only 55 percent of cigarettes sold in New York. We wondered whether the negative impact of the higher taxes on low-income smokers is overstated if many of them stop smoking. Farrelly said experts debate that question. He thinks there is still an impact. "(The higher taxes) alleviates some of the regressivity," Farrelly said, "but it doesn’t eliminate it." Across the Atlantic, when Germany increased its taxes on cigarettes in December 2004 and September 2005, approximately one of eight smokers went to a neighboring nation to buy their smokes at a cheaper price, a team of researchers found. To sum up, Sutton said excise taxes on cigarettes are "disproportionately burdening middle- and lower-income consumers." Numerous studies show Sutton’s claim is on target, but a larger percentage of them also quit smoking. Our rating: Mostly True.	None	David Sutton	None	None	None	2013-07-16T00:00:00	2013-06-30	['None']
pomt-07093	Multnomah County’s food action plan "clearly plans to disrupt the free market system in terms of food choices making it harder and more expensive for many residents to eat their food of choice."	pants on fire!	/oregon/statements/2011/jun/24/roxanne-ross/will-multnomah-countys-food-plan-make-it-harder-pe/	A tweet came to our attention recently, courtesy of the lively left-leaning and right-leaning twitterati who use the #orpol hashtag. ORLibertyGal tweeted: "Multnomah County plans to interfere with your food delivery. Oh goodie http://bit.ly/jFhTe5" Minutes later, BlueOregon contributor T.A. Barnhart responded: "onus on fearmongers to provide FACTS. | RT @ORlibertygal: MultCo plans to interfere w/food delivery. http://bit.ly/jFhTe5 #orpol #orleg" Facts? We love facts. Multnomah County wants to mess with food delivery? We better look into this. (Thanks Barnhart!) It turns out that the tweet stemmed from an online post at Red County, a website for conservative politicos. Gresham resident and Tea Party activist Roxanne Ross accused Multnomah County of using its 2009 food action plan "to artificially inflate the market" for organic local produce while dampening the availability of cheaper mass produced foods. The county,writes Ross, "clearly plans to disrupt the free market system in terms of food choices making it harder and more expensive for many residents to eat their food of choice." Some specifics cited by Ross (in our own words): Multnomah County wants to turn available space into farm plots, in order to feed more people within county lines. Multnomah County plans to disrupt restaurant food delivery service, by having retailers buy from local farmers. Multnomah County wants "communal kitchens" to encourage more use of local foods. Naturally, we had to study the plan for ourselves. We wondered if the county had visions of turning itself into a self-sustaining village with high taxes on out-of-county products. We turned to the Multnomah Food Action Plan 2025 and found that it’s not quite what Ross claims. The plan is aspirational and fuzzy, with backers saying it should lead to more collaboration and focus. From the document itself: "The 15-year action plan offers four action areas containing 16 goals and 65 communitywide collaborative actions for local government, businesses, nonprofit organizations, faith communities, and learning institutions. This Plan also offers 40 actions for individual community members whose daily choices or lack of choices in what to eat, where to shop, and how to become an advocate for change greatly influence our community." That’s a lot of partnerships and a lot of emphasis on individual choice. And frankly, it all sounds very pie-in-the-sky to PolitiFact Oregon. But we digress. Simply put, we bet that by 2025, shoppers will still be able to buy low-priced meats and potato chips from Fred Meyer. David Austin, spokesman for the county, agrees. He described the food plan as a promotional tool, a way to encourage residents and businesses to think of healthy food choices. (For example, sustainability staff just held its second "food summit" in June.) In 15 years, he said, as a result of the plan there might be healthier food choices in food-deprived neighborhoods currently served by convenience stores. Or, he said, there might be more community gardens with neighbors donating produce to the Oregon Food Bank. "Multnomah County is not going to put a sign on every corner and demand that no chips are sold here. At the same time, we want to make sure all of our residents have equal access to healthy food," he said. In an email, Ross said she’s not saying the county will halt importation of food. But she insists that the "market manipulations" cited in the plan, such as zoning for urban farms, will protect local foods, meaning that "for those people who prefer meat and food from outside the county, it will mean increased cost for food." Since we’re not economists, we decided to ask Portland State University environmental economics professor David Ervin how a fuzzy food plan could result in higher prices for meat and other foods from outside the county. He was puzzled. "Unless there’s regulations restricting the entry of food, of those foods she’s talking about, or there’s some additional costs imposed on those foods, then there’s not good economic logic on why their costs would go up," he said. "Those prices are set in national markets." Ervin explains that if more people choose to eat local food, that "will reduce the demand for those other imported foods, but I doubt that would have much of a price effect because we’re such a small part of the market." Just to make absolutely sure, we called the Cascade Policy Institute, a libertarian think tank that loves all things free market and hates government meddling. We got an earful from John Charles, the institute’s president and CEO, on both the meaninglessness of the plan, as well as its inconsistencies, and its poor writing. But the bottom line, he said, is that government already has the tools to encourage food choice: get rid of restrictive codes and high business taxes. "Assuming that eating locally grown food is desirable -- I don’t care whether people eat imported food, it is not a function of government to even care... ," he said. "... Assuming there’s some reason why local is good, we can accomplish that by relaxing some regulations, and giving producers and consumers the maximum choices." We asked Charles specifically whether the county’s plan would result in higher prices of meat and non-local foods. He said no. In the end, we don’t see how encouraging urban gardening and healthy eating and supporting a communal kitchen and small farmers will lead to higher prices for meat and bulk foods. There’s no disruption to the free flow of goods in and out of the market. In fact, those points -- price and disruption -- are ridiculous. We rate the claim Pants on Fire. Comment on this item.

pomt-05482	Every time the price of gasoline rises 1 cent, "it's a billion dollars out of our economy that goes to Saudi Arabia."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/apr/19/tommy-thompson/wisconsin-gop-senate-candidate-tommy-thompson-says/	In a March 23, 2012 campaign speech, Republican U.S. Senate candidate Tommy Thompson made a billion-dollar claim about a 1-cent increase in the price of gasoline. Addressing the La Crosse County Republican Party in western Wisconsin, the former Wisconsin governor called for the United States to become "energy independent," then said: "Every time, ladies and gentlemen, a penny goes up on that gasoline cost -- and how do you like those $4.25 a gallon? -- every time a penny goes up, it's a billion dollars out of our economy that goes to Saudi Arabia." That’s real money. Does cash really flow out of the country at that rate -- to a single oil-producing country -- from folks filling their gas tanks? When we asked the Thompson campaign for evidence, consultant Darrin Schmitz made two points in an email: 1. Thompson meant to say Middle East when he referred to Saudi Arabia. So, right off the bat, Thompson’s claim appears to be wrong. 2. A 50-cent increase in the price of gas costs U.S. consumers nearly $60 billion per year, according to a March 2012 article in The Atlantic magazine. The Atlantic article did say a 1-cent gas price increase would cost U.S. consumers $1.2 billion per year, which puts something of a time frame on Thompson’s statement. But that’s a different measure than $1 billion going from the U.S. economy to Saudi Arabia (or the Middle East, for that matter). We contacted four experts, each of whom used essentially the same math to evaluate Thompson’s Saudi Arabia claim. They agreed that a 1-cent increase in the price of a gallon of gas indicates that the price of a barrel of crude oil had risen 42 cents. Jay Hakes is the former director of the U.S. Energy Information Administration under President Bill Clinton and author of A Declaration of Energy Independence. He said that on average, the U.S. imported 1,195,000 barrels of Saudi petroleum per day in 2011, according to the Energy Information Administration. If each barrel cost 42 cents more, the U.S. would pay Saudi Arabia $501,900 more per day -- or slightly more than $183 million per year. That means it would take nearly 5 1/2 years for the U.S. to spend $1 billion more on Saudi oil. John Kingston is global director of news for the energy publication Platts. He multiplied 42 cents by a slightly different number -- 1,422,000 -- the net number of barrels per day imported from Saudi Arabia in January 2012, which is the most recent figure available. That comes to an additional cost of $597,240 per day, or nearly $218 million per year. So it would take 4-1/2 years to reach $1 billion. Jim Williams is an energy economist and owner of WTRG Economics in Arkansas. He took the same approach Kingston did. Charles Ebinger is director of the energy security initiative at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C. think tank. He said that for years, many people have claimed that a 1-cent increase in the gasoline tax would cost motorists $1 billion a year. He said that is roughly accurate, depending on how much gas motorists consume in a given year. Thompson didn’t mention a gas tax increase in his statement, but let’s take a look. Ebinger said that if a 1-cent increase in the cost of gas costs motorists $1 billion over one year, about $130 million of that money would go to Saudi Arabia, since about 13 percent of crude oil imports come from that country. At that rate, it would take nearly eight years for Saudi Arabia to collect an additional $1 billion from the United States. In any case, although Thompson singled it out, Saudi Arabia isn’t the largest provider of crude to the United States. The latest figures show that in January 2012, net oil imports from Canada were 2.66 million barrels per day, nearly double the 1.42 million barrels from Saudi Arabia, which ranked second. For all of 2011, Canada ranked first, Mexico second and Saudi Arabia third in the number of barrels imported per day. And the balance of U.S. imports and exports is improving. In 2011, U.S. exports of gasoline, diesel and other fuels exceeded imports for the first time since 1949, according to a claim rated True by PolitiFact New Jersey. The biggest contributing factor, however, was the increase in foreign purchases of distillate fuel, which includes diesel fuel and heating oil. Our rating Thompson said that every time the price of gasoline increases by 1 cent, "it's a billion out of our economy that goes to Saudi Arabia." His campaign said Thompson meant to say Middle East and cited a statistic that covers a one-year period. Four experts said it would take roughly four to eight years for a 1-cent increase in gas prices to result in an increase of $1 billion in what the U.S. spends to import Saudi oil. (Incidentally, we asked Williams, one of the experts, about the Middle East. He said it would take 3-1/2 years for $1 billion to flow from the U.S. to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Qatar and United Arab Emirates as a result of a penny increase in gas. So, even if Thompson had said Middle East instead of Saudi Arabia, his statement would be inaccurate.) We rate Thompson’s claim False. (You can comment on this item on the Journal Sentinel's web site) Editor's note: On April 20, 2012 we revised this item to note that if the price of a barrel of oil rose by 42 cents, the U.S. would pay Saudi Arabia $501,900 more per day -- or slightly more than $183 million per year. The original wording, which said the U.S. would pay $501,900 more per barrel per day, was incorrect.	None	Tommy Thompson	None	None	None	2012-04-19T09:00:00	2012-03-23	['Saudi_Arabia']

pomt-03671	Says businesses pay roughly 60 percent of taxes in Texas.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/apr/26/bill-hammond/business-group-leader-says-businesses-pay-roughly-/	As taxpayers faced the deadline for federal returns, Texas Gov. Rick Perry called for $1.6 billion in tax cuts for businesses in Texas. His proposal was "right and proper," business leader Bill Hammond said at Perry’s April 15, 2013, press conference, because "Texas businesses pay roughly 60 percent of all taxes that are paid in Texas today." PolitiFact Texas checked a similar statement in 2011, rating as Mostly True a state senator’s claim that businesses "pay most of the taxes" in Texas. Do businesses currently pay 60 percent? Hammond told us by phone that he intended his remark to encompass both state and local taxes. Generally, businesses in Texas shoulder a higher-than-average initial tax burden because the state is one of only nine with no income tax on individuals. Experts agree, though, that the burden eventually shifts to individuals as businesses raise prices, lower wages or send less profit to shareholders. In our 2011 fact-check, we looked at a report the Texas state comptroller publishes every two years predicting how much Texas will pull in from the state taxes that recently generated more than 2.5 percent of revenue. State law also requires the report to estimate how much will be paid in local school property taxes, although those are determined by and paid to individual districts, not the state. The report breaks out the (predicted initial) impact each tax has on businesses and consumers -- i.e., how much they pay. The latest report, published March 7, 2013, examined: Four taxes paid entirely by businesses -- franchise tax (the main tax on businesses’ revenues), natural gas tax, insurance premium tax and oil production tax. One tax paid entirely by consumers -- cigarette tax. Four taxes shared by the two groups -- sales tax, gasoline tax, motor vehicle sales tax and school property tax. Looking ahead to Texas’ fiscal year 2015 -- the 12 months ending Aug. 31, 2015 -- the comptroller predicted businesses would pay $37.2 billion (52 percent) with consumers paying $34.9 billion (48 percent). Comptroller’s spokesman R.J. DeSilva told us the eight state taxes in the report accounted for about 92 percent of state tax revenue in fiscal 2012. But there are other taxes Texas businesses pay, including city and county property taxes that, like school property taxes, don’t flow into state coffers. Dick Lavine, senior fiscal analyst with the liberal, Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, told us by email, "I hate to be making Hammond's case, but the bulk of the Comptroller's study includes only the major state taxes." Dale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association business group, said by email that the taxes left out of the comptroller’s report -- even if they’re only 8 percent of total revenue -- fall primarily on businesses. Examples he gave: taxes on "diesel, alcohol, tobacco excise (other than cigarettes), utility taxes, hotel taxes." Another major cost to businesses, Craymer said, is the state’s unemployment insurance tax -- money collected from employers under state law and redistributed by the Texas Workforce Commission as benefits to unemployed Texans. As in our earlier story, Hammond and Craymer each recommended a report -- "the most comprehensive comparative study," Craymer said -- done by consultants Ernst & Young for the Council on State Taxation, a Washington-based trade association representing corporate businesses. Spokesman Robert Wood at the Texas Association of Business, which Hammond heads, emailed us the council’s 2009 report on state and local tax burdens, which said that businesses paid nearly 61 percent of Texas taxes in the state’s fiscal 2008. A co-author of the report, Andrew Phillips at Ernst & Young, told us by email that according to their calculations, businesses paid about 60 percent of Texas taxes in fiscal 2009 and 61 percent in fiscal 2010 and 2011. Because those percentages were noticeably higher than our comptroller-based percentage, we drilled down into the results. Phillips pointed out several differences between the two estimates. As noted above, the comptroller was projecting ahead to 2015, whereas Ernst & Young was speaking to years in the recent past. He said Ernst & Young tabulated not just school property taxes but all local property taxes reported by the U.S. Census Bureau, adding up to a total $39 billion in fiscal 2011. Also, Ernst & Young included $2.4 billion in unemployment insurance tax paid by businesses in fiscal 2011, Phillips said. Hammond said, "The point is that businesses in Texas do pay, by any measure, more taxes than individuals and homeowners pay in Texas. ... We obviously believe that the Ernst & Young study is more correct for the last few years." Our ruling Hammond said businesses pay roughly 60 percent of the state’s tax bill. By our calculations using state projections that do not take into account all taxes, businesses will pay 52 percent of taxes in the state in 2015. In contrast, Hammond’s source, a national group representing corporations, calculates that businesses paid 61 percent of all taxes in Texas in fiscal 2011. So, estimates vary because different taxes are considered. Keeping in mind, too, that businesses offload many expenses including taxes, we rate Hammond’s claim as Mostly True. From 2013 comptroller report: Predicted 2015 "tax burden" Businesses Consumers Sales tax (state) $11.7 billion $16.5 billion Franchise tax (state) $4.8 billion $0 Gasoline tax (state) $4.3 billion $2 billion Motor vehicle sales tax (state) $1.5 billion $2.3 billion School property taxes (local) $13.6 billion $12.7 billion Cigarette tax (state) $0 $1.3 billion Oil production tax (state) $2.3 billion $0 Natural gas tax (state) $1.3 billion $0 Insurance premium tax (state) $1.6 billion $0	None	Bill Hammond	None	None	None	2013-04-26T12:00:00	2013-04-15	['Texas']
pomt-11147	"I’m in prison for practicing politics."	pants on fire!	/illinois/statements/2018/may/29/rod-blagojevich/blago-op-ed-falsely-claims-he-prison-practicing-po/	There’s little need to rehash the saga of Rod Blagojevich, Illinois’ 40th governor and the only one ever impeached. For the last six years he has been locked up in a federal prison in Littleton, Colorado, serving a 14-year sentence for convictions on an array of corruption charges, including a spectacularly brazen attempt to sell his power as governor to fill the U.S. Senate seat left vacant by the ascension of Barack Obama to the presidency. Blagojevich has exhausted all appeals through the courts to get his conviction overturned or the sentence reduced. Lately, his family and some diehard supporters have made noises about seeking a pardon from President Donald Trump, who once featured Blagojevich on his Celebrity Apprentice TV show and who, judging by his tweets, has his own beef with aggressive prosecutors. Against that backdrop, federal prisoner number 40892-424 this week penned a column in the conservative opinion pages of The Wall Street Journal, owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch who is tight with Trump. Murdoch also owns the conservative Fox News Channel, which the president is known to binge watch. Blagojevich framed his column as a cautionary tale to other politicians, warning that he had been hounded unfairly by an out-of-control Justice Department "abusing their power to criminalize the routine practices of politics and government." "I’m in Prison for Practicing Politics," the headline on his opinion article declared. All of which raises some provocative questions. Is Blagojevich really the victim here, as he clearly suggests? And was he sent to prison for merely doing the same things other politicians and government officials routinely do? The tragicomic governor First, a note of explanation. The authors of this fact-check have more than a passing knowledge of Blagojevich. One covered every moment of both his federal corruption trials as a reporter for The Chicago Tribune, the other also as a Tribune reporter covered the federal investigation that led to Blagojevich’s indictment and later co-authored a book chronicling his political rise and fall. The portrait that emerged from that up-close observation was of a leader sublimely self-righteous, comically vain, untrustworthy, uninterested in the process of governing, unsophisticated in the arts of policy and deal making and not particularly discriminating in whose counsel he sought. As governor, he waged a bitter public battle with his father-in-law, who had been his political mentor. Another top adviser and fundraiser went to prison in corruption schemes that served as a precursor to Blagojevich’s own indictment. Another top fundraiser committed suicide after pleading guilty to federal charges in a kickback scheme. On the day he was sentenced in December 2011, Blagojevich fell on his sword before U.S. District Judge James Zagel, appearing to own his misdeeds in a plea for mercy that did not work. "My life is ruined," he told Zagel. "I have nobody to blame but myself for my stupidity and actions and words and what I thought I could do. I’m not blaming anybody." But in his Wall Street Journal article, Blagojevich made clear that he was no longer blaming himself as he accused prosecutors and the FBI of abusing their powers to bring him down. "Here I am in my sixth year of a 14-year prison sentence for the routine practice of attempting to raise campaign funds while governor," he wrote. Blagojevich’s legal team raised that defense at trial, but jurors rejected it. Acting on a tip from a longtime Blagojevich confidant, government agents received court approval to wiretap phones in the governor’s home and political office. It was evidence gathered from those wiretaps, much of it from Blagojevich’s own mouth, that served as the centerpiece of the case against him. Over two separate trials, Blagojevich was convicted on 18 criminal counts including wire fraud, bribery, attempted extortion, conspiracy and lying to the FBI. Five of those counts were later tossed on appeal, but the crimes for which he still stands convicted include: Trying to shake down the CEO of Children’s Memorial Hospital for $25,000 in campaign cash in exchange for a hike in state reimbursements for pediatric specialists. Withholding approval of legislation to help the horseracing industry until a track owner came up with a $100,000 political donation. Dangling the Senate appointment as bait to gain campaign cash for his political operation or a new and more lucrative job for himself inside or outside of government. Among wiretaps played at trial were some that captured Blagojevich discussing a scheme to appoint a longtime political adversary to the post, then U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., in exchange for $1.5 million in political donations. Prosecutors said they arrested Blagojevich in December 2008 to prevent him from pulling the trigger on that deal. Our ruling "I’m in prison for practicing politics," read the headline on the article by the former Illinois governor. Blagojevich and his legal team also made the "politics as usual, nothing to see here" argument during his trials, but such claims were soundly rejected by federal jurors. Over two trials, they convicted him of multiple criminal counts stemming from his conduct in office. Much of the evidence presented at those trials stemmed from court-ordered wiretaps on which Blagojevich was heard scheming to carry out the very crimes for which he was convicted. Blagojevich was contrite about his actions at his sentencing, appearing to own up to misdeeds. Now, in playing the victim card, he is attempting to take that all back. But Blagojevich’s own words and deeds proved his undoing. Illinois has certainly suffered its share of public corruption, and skepticism about politicians abounds. But Blagojevich’s "everybody does it" argument seems an over-the-top exercise in desperation and self-pity. We give his claims our lowest credibility rating, Pants On Fire!

pomt-02900	Says Barack Obama "knew half of the population of the United States would lose their health insurance."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/06/glenn-beck/beck-says-obama-knew-50-americans-would-lose-healt/	The attacks continue against President Barack Obama for saying "if you like your plan, you can keep your plan." Latest up: Conservative radio talk show host Glenn Beck, who claims Obama knew what was going to happen all along. "They had the studies that showed that up to 80 million people would lose their health insurance," Beck said Monday on his radio show, which is syndicated on more than 400 stations. "Now we find out this week that number is actually 125 million. Half of the population in the United States, they knew half of the population of the United States would lose their doctor and their health insurance? "And yet he went on the road over and over and over and over and over and over again and said, ‘You'll be able to keep your doctor if you like him, you’ll be able to keep your health insurance,’ when they knew half of the population the United States would lose their health insurance." That’s a hefty claim. Not only is Beck saying half of all Americans will lose their health insurance because of the health care law, but that Obama knew about it in advance. (Fox News had a more limited version of this claim with millions of Americans losing coverage.) The Glenn Beck Show told us that the claim came from an article in the Daily Caller, a conservative news website.The item cites the work of Christopher Conover, a scholar at the Center for Health Policy and Inequalities Research at Duke University and an adjunct scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. (The American Enterprise Institute and its scholars have generally been critical of the health care law.) Conover, in his work, looks ahead to the end of 2014 and makes a few predictions. "Of the 189 million Americans with private health insurance coverage, I estimate that if Obamacare is fully implemented, at least 129 million (68 percent) will not be able to keep their previous health care plan," Conover said. That’s where Beck gets his 125 million figure, which for the record, is about 40 percent of the population of the United States, not 50 percent. Conover continues, "But of these (129 million), ‘only’ 18 to 50 million will literally lose coverage, i.e., have their plans entirely taken away. ... The rest will retain their old plans but have to pay higher rates for Obamacare-mandated bells and whistles." Whether you believe Conover or not is irrelevant when considering Beck’s claim. Conover says 18 million to 50 million people will lose coverage -- Beck said 125 million, a gross exaggeration. But that’s only one issue. Conover himself takes issue with Beck’s use of his estimate. "In my view, ‘lose their health insurance’ without any further qualification has a different connotation than ‘not be able to keep their previous health plan’," he told PunditFact. "Absent any further explanation, many might interpret ‘losing’ health coverage as becoming uninsured." What they did know So Beck’s claim is obviously wrong as to the number. But he also indicated Obama knew that millions of people would lose their health insurance. What evidence is there of that? It is not as though the White House was unaware that the Affordable Care Act would change business as usual, in both the individual and group health insurance markets. (The individual market is where people buy insurance on their own; the group market is when an employer does the buying and tells workers what their options are.) An NBC report cited four administration sources who said that early on, they expected that up to three-quarters of people in the individual market would get cancellation notices. And back in 2010, analysts from three federal departments, Labor, Health and Human Services and the Internal Revenue Service, looked at the number of employer-based plans that would change to the point that they would lose their grandfathered status. But that study did not try to account for a very common situation -- plans that changed, but already met the new health care law’s standards. According to a 2013 survey by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans, about three-quarters of all employer-sponsored health plans already meet the criteria of the Affordable Care Act. In other words, employers plans may have changed, but it’s not directly and unilaterally attributable to the health care law. Beck’s staff offered a narrower view -- that any plan that changes means you have lost your insurance. If so, then many employees have been losing their insurance every year as plans change, premiums increase, or co-pays swing one way or the other. Conover said part of the point of his analysis is that plans will change but coverage would remain. The best way to describe his analysis, he said: "Half of those with private insurance would be unable to keep their pre-ACA plans." Other experts PunditFact spoke with agreed that there’s a big difference between losing your health insurance and seeing your plan change. "It does not mean that someone is losing their insurance plan," said Jonathan Oberlander, professor of health policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. "The situation is different in the individual market, where plans (many of which offer limited coverage) are being canceled by insurers. But the individual market only represents about 5 percent of the country." Scott Harrington, professor of health care management at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, was equally emphatic. "Losing grandfathered status does not mean that you lose your health insurance," Harrington said. Our ruling Beck said that when Obama promised that people could keep the plans they like, he knew that half of all Americans would lose their health insurance. Beck is wrong in every respect. The primary study he relied on contradicts his number, saying that at most 50 million people would lose coverage, not 125 million. Beck’s staff said they believe that any change in a plan means you have lost your health insurance. Not even the author of the study Beck cites agrees with that, nor do the other health policy experts we consulted. On top of that, the government estimate of the number of plans that would be fully exposed to the new insurance requirements actually says little about the law’s impact. The law’s requirements would only matter for plans that did not measure up; many of them already did. Lastly, there is no evidence that Obama knew or believed that a calamity of this magnitude was in store. The claim needs a checkup. We rate it Pants on Fire.

pomt-08747	"The federal government is now on track" for the second-largest budget deficit "in 65 years."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/30/glenn-beck/beck-claims-us-track-second-biggest-deficit-65-yea/	Vice President Joe Biden talks a lot about the success of the government's economic policies, but not everybody is persuaded. Reacting to Biden's Aug. 24, 2010, statement that "we are turning this great ship of state around," TV host Glenn Beck pointed to the country's dire fiscal situation. "Remember, Joe Biden says no doubt we're headed in the right direction on the economy. Well, we're just getting started with the news of the day. How about this one? Unemployment 9.6 percent. The real unemployment number is 16.5 for July. The federal government is now on track for the second-largest budget shortfall in 65 years, 9.1 of GDP. And in 31 months, Congress has added $4.4 trillion to the 10-year spending baseline. Who's going to lend us more money?" Beck said on his Aug. 25, 2010, show. In this item, we'll focus on the claim that the federal government "is now on track for the second-largest budget shortfall in 65 years." We turned to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the official scorekeeper for Congress. Its most recent estimates, published in August 2010, indicate that in 2010, the federal deficit will exceed $1.3 trillion. As a percentage of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product -- the value of the goods and services that the economy produces -- that's 9.1 percent, as Beck said. How does that compare with previous years? We checked data going back to 1930 from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), a government agency that helps prepare the president's annual budget. Only in 2009 and in the war years 1942, 1943, 1944 and 1945 was the deficit-to-GDP ratio higher than 9.1 percent, according to the OMB. But going back 65 years only takes you to 1946, so that would put 2010 on track to be the second-highest, according to CBO's figures. The CBO and the OMB have slightly different projections for the 2010 deficit, with the CBO's being the more recent. The discrepancy arises from differences in the agencies' projections of future economic conditions and the impact of legislation enacted after the OMB completed its estimates. OMB projected in July that the 2010 deficit will be 10.6 percent of GDP. That would make it the biggest in 65 years -- not the second biggest. But looking back 65 years and using the CBO's estimate, as Beck did, the deficit was higher as a percentage of GDP only in 2009, when it stood at 9.9 percent. We thought it would be valuable to explore the reasons behind the current deficit as well as the projected deficits over the next decade. We spoke to a number of economists and found that they offer different explanations. Brian Riedl, a budget analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told us via e-mail that the main drivers of today's deficit are the ongoing economic downturn, which has reduced government revenues, and the policies that the government has enacted in response to the crisis. "Recession automatically reduces revenues and increases unemployment and antipoverty spending, even if Congress does nothing. At the same time, we have enacted $1 trillion in stimulus spending, plus TARP, Fannie/Freddie bailouts, and large discretionary spending hikes. So enacted policies are certainly a contributor," Riedl wrote. The CBO provided a similar explanation. "This year’s deficit is attributable in large part to a combination of weak revenues and elevated spending associated with the economic downturn and the policies implemented in response to it." Speaking about future projections, Riedl wrote that future deficits are likely to remain well over a trillion due to "runaway government spending." Kathy Ruffing, a senior policy analyst at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, emphasized that even before President Barack Obama took office, the CBO had already projected that the 2009 deficit would exceed $1 trillion. The 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan accounted for over $500 billion of that, she wrote on June 28, 2010. Riedl, however, disagrees. "Both recent and future budget deficits have been blamed largely on the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, and to a lesser extent on the war on terrorism, but the data contradict these myths. In reality, spending is almost exclusively the problem," he wrote in a June 2010 report. Finally, Chris Dreibelbis, the outreach and public liaison for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan Washington, D.C., think tank, pointed to the recession and the policy responses to it as the "main culprits" in the current deficit. "Going forward, the structural problems that were there before the recession will combine with the growth in spending from an aging population and health care costs, to cause large and ongoing deficits even once the economy recovers," he wrote us in an e-mail. So let's review. Beck said that we're on track to have the second-biggest budget deficit in 65 years. According to the Congressional Budget Office, he's right. Going by the administration's own estimate, the situation is even more dire. We found disagreement among economists as to why the deficits are soaring, but Beck's point stands, so we rate this True.

pomt-06463	"(Sen. Robert) Gordon cost us money, exempting the Newark sports arena from paying property taxes and sticking us with the bill."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/oct/19/john-driscoll/property-taxes-newarks-prudential-center-become-is/	The Prudential Center in Newark is not in his legislative district or even one of the counties he's looking to represent in Trenton, but Republican State Senate candidate John Driscoll Jr. wants voters in parts of Bergen and Passaic counties to know the arena doesn’t pay property taxes. For that exemption, Driscoll says voters can blame his opponent in the Nov. 8 general election, Democratic incumbent Robert Gordon. Looking to unseat Gordon in the 38th Legislative District, Driscoll, a Bergen County freeholder, recently put out a television ad lambasting the senator for allegedly raising taxes and chasing away jobs from Bergen County. With cash flying from the image of a family superimposed over a photo of the Prudential Center, the narrator intones: "Gordon cost us money, exempting the Newark sports arena from paying property taxes and sticking us with the bill." PolitiFact New Jersey found that Gordon did vote in 2008 to exempt the Newark Housing Authority, which owns the arena, from paying property taxes there. But that property tax exemption did not have a direct effect on voters in Bergen and Passaic counties, who are the target audience for the ad. First, let’s explain the property tax exemption. Gordon was one of 21 senators -- the minimum needed for passage -- to vote for a bill in 2008 exempting projects like the Prudential Center from paying property taxes. The bill was later signed into law by former Gov. Jon Corzine. Without such an exemption, the authority would have had to pay $6 million in property taxes to the city, authority attorney Paul Sangillo said at the time. So, Driscoll’s ad is right that Gordon supported an exemption for the Prudential Center, which means the city does not receive property tax revenues from the arena property. Otherwise, those tax revenues would go to the city, its school district and Essex County. In a statement, Newark spokeswoman Anne Torres said the tax exemption is appropriate, because the arena property is publicly owned. The authority collects rent at the arena on behalf of the city, Torres said. "If the property were not exempt, the NHA would likely have to expend federal or state funding or in other words ‘tax dollars’ to afford the taxes on the property," according to the statement. "Without revisiting the original ownership structure, the exemption from that view potentially saved tax dollars." Former New Jersey Deputy Attorney General Robert Blau, who has an extensive background in real estate matters, also noted the impact of other tax revenue, such as sales taxes: "There are certainly other taxes that Newark gets because of the existence of the center. It’s not just lost property taxes." OK, so Newark is not receiving property taxes from the arena property, but the ad claims the exemption "cost us money." Who is "us?" Driscoll spokesman Greg Volpe said "us" refers to taxpayers, and pointed to news articles showing that Newark has needed additional state aid both before and after that exemption was granted. "The special exemption for (the) Newark Arena cost the city's bottom line millions of dollars in recurring revenue," Volpe said in an email. "State Legislators were wrong to exempt one of Newark's revenue assets and the result is state taxpayers, including those in the 38th District, have continued to pick up the bill." But the ad doesn’t mention those additional state aid awards, giving viewers the impression that "bill" refers to the property tax exemption alone. The absence of those property tax payments only has a direct impact on Newark, its school district and Essex County. "I’m not aware of any rationale by which it could be said that a Newark local property tax exemption could be said to impact taxpayers outside of Essex County," Joseph Ragno, an attorney with extensive experience in tax abatements, said in an email. Our ruling In a TV ad, Driscoll claims Gordon cost taxpayers money by "exempting the Newark sports arena from paying property taxes and sticking us with the bill." Gordon did support that exemption, and news articles show that Newark has needed additional state aid dollars over the years. But the ad ties the "bill" to the property tax exemption, and the only entities directly affected are the city, the school district and the county -- not those voters in Bergen and Passaic counties. We rate the statement Mostly False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	John Driscoll	None	None	None	2011-10-19T05:15:00	2011-10-06	['Newark,_New_Jersey']
pomt-03657	"Despite having their budget increased by over 40 percent since 2009 … pending claims for benefits with the (Department of Veterans Affairs) have increased from 391,000 to 890,000 under the Obama Administration."	true	/georgia/statements/2013/apr/30/tom-graves/backlog-veterans-benefits-draws-scrutiny/	More than a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan may have wound down, but policymakers warn the fight has just begun for some veterans. They say these warriors’ newest foe is a homegrown threat: bureaucracy at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. A backlog of disability claims has forced a growing number of veterans suffering from head trauma, post-traumatic stress disorder and other ailments to wait for months and sometimes more than a year for word of whether the federal government will help them. Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Graves of Ranger called the backlog "immoral" in a recent op-ed, and he used a stream of factoids to demonstrate how bad the problem has gotten. These figures piqued our interest: "Despite having their budget increased by over 40 percent since 2009 … pending claims for benefits with the VA have increased from 391,000 to 890,000 under the Obama Administration," he said on ZPolitics, a website launched by talk radio host and former congressional candidate Martha Zoller. If Graves is correct, the number of pending claims has grown by more than 125 percent. Is this true? And was the agency’s budget hike really this steep, despite the budget-cutting debates of recent years? We contacted Graves spokesman John Donnelly for more information. The congressman’s criticism is part of a growing chorus of complaints that the VA takes too long to tell veterans whether they’ll receive disability assistance. News stories have chronicled cases where veterans died as they waited for an answer. Lawmakers are clamoring for action, and VA Secretary Eric Shinseki has vowed to eliminate the backlog by 2015. Donnelly responded to PolitiFact Georgia’s request for more information with the VA’s own figures. First, let’s look at the VA’s budget. A 10-year overview published on its website showed that in fiscal year 2009, it totaled $97.7 billion. Now it’s $140.3 billion. That’s a 43.6 jump, or as Graves said, an increase of "over 40 percent." Now, let’s consider disability claims. Although the controversy centers on backlogged claims -- defined as those pending more than 125 days -- Graves’ statement concerns "pending" claims, those awaiting a disability rating decision by the VA. Graves wants veterans to have to wait no more than 30 days for a decision. For this portion of our fact check, Donnelly referred us to the VA’s weekly disability claims reports. On Jan. 21, 2009, one day after Obama was sworn into office, the department released a report that said the number of pending cases totaled 391,127. The April 8, 2013, report was the most recent one available when Graves submitted his op-ed to ZPolitics, Donnelly said. We found it reported 889,981 pending claims. Sure enough, Graves used accurate figures. But did he put them in the correct context? Although Graves did not accuse Obama of causing the growth in pending claims, he did mention that the increase took place under the president’s watch. This suggests that the current administration bears at least some responsibility for the problem. We looked to see whether it does. We found that the backlog has been a long time coming. The benefits system had been outdated for years before Obama took office. When Shinseki, an Obama appointee, took over the department in 2009, it used paper files, not electronic ones. It did not have enough staff to handle the onslaught of veterans returning from a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan. "I don't think we really anticipated the nature of injuries, the multiple deployments. Men and women are surviving injuries that would have been sure death 20 or 25 years ago," said Dave Autry, a spokesman with DAV, an organization that advocates for disabled American veterans. The VA hired more staff and in fiscal 2011 completed 1 million claims, a 6 percent increase from 2009, according to the Government Accountability Office. But the number of claims received grew 29 percent, the GAO reported. Veterans advocates told us that even though the VA increased staff, training fell short and claims administrators made bad decisions. Veterans appealed, and the backlog grew even larger. A computerized system intended to streamline the process is still being implemented. What’s worse is that to prove they are disabled, veterans have to pull together documents from the Social Security Administration, the Department of Defense and other federal bureaucracies that do not share information, said Paul Rieckhoff, who heads Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, which has been pushing for improvement. "What you see is really a bureaucratic failure that stretches across the government," Rieckhoff said. "We don't think it's been a partisan issue." In sum, Graves’ numbers are correct. The VA’s budget has increased by more than 40 percent, and the number of pending claims has skyrocketed from some 391,000 to 890,000 under the Obama administration. Graves also was accurate in noting that the increase took place under the president’s watch. While the VA’s benefits system has been troubled since well before Obama took office, efforts during his administration have not prepared the department for its current challenges.

pomt-06776	The results of Atlanta Public School’s 2010 and 2011 CRCT tests "have not been questioned."	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2011/aug/19/beverly-hall/former-atlanta-schools-cheif-halls-says-recent-sco/	Former Atlanta schools chief Beverly Hall is defending her reputation in a national education publication. Investigators released a report in July that found soaring scores on the Criterion-Referenced Competency Tests that made Hall an education star were the result of widespread cheating. Critics have called her a crook and a liar. Some want her to return more than a half-million dollars in bonuses. Others want her behind bars. So when the trade publication Education Week ran a commentary by Hall on Aug. 10, PolitiFact Georgia took notice. What could she possibly say to clear her name? Hall’s piece, "The Scandal Is Not the Whole Story," argued that because the district improved test security in 2010 and 2011, cheating did not taint all of APS’ gains. "The results of the standardized tests administered in 2010 and 2011 under this enhanced security have not been questioned -- and most important of all -- the dramatic improvement in test scores has remained," Hall wrote. The 2010 and 2011 results "have not been questioned"? We reached for our Truth-O-Meter. Before we launch into our analysis, we need to make two points. The first is that this story will not address whether APS tests scores registered "dramatic improvement." We’ll leave that question for another time. More importantly, when Hall got wind of our story, she decided to revise the sentence we are checking. Now it reads "the results of the standardized tests administered in 2010 and 2011 under this enhanced security indicate that dramatic improvement in test scores has remained." Since her unrevised statement was online for more than a week, we think it’s still fair game to check it. Now on to Hall’s statement. We asked Hall’s lawyer for proof, but he did not respond. Fortunately, we had plenty of other sources. One was the Governor’s Office of Student Achievement, which launched a statewide analysis of 2009 CRCT tests the same year a probe by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution found improbable gains in test scores. At two schools, the odds of making such leaps were less than 1 in a billion. GOSA Executive Director Kathleen Mathers said Hall is wrong about 2010’s results. GOSA flagged 16 Atlanta elementary and middle schools for possible cheating on that year’s test. This means that 11 percent or more of their classrooms showed high numbers of wrong-to-right erasures, which is a sign of possible cheating. Thirteen of these schools had already been flagged for their 2009 scores. Mathers also referred us to the state investigation that found widespread APS corruption. It uncovered even more evidence of testing impropriety or outright cheating on the 2010 CRCT. Here are some examples: *Parks Middle School: A teacher saw evidence that a paraprofessional gave the school’s principal a testing booklet that he was not supposed to have. When she reported the incident, the principal pressured her to change her story. * Dunbar Elementary: One teacher found what he thought to be math formula cheat sheets on every student’s desk during math CRCT testing. He also discovered that students had their social studies books out before the social studies CRCT tests. * D.H. Stanton Elementary: Teachers said they think cheating occurred because the school’s testing coordinator allowed teachers who were friends to administer the test to each other’s students. Some had a reputation for cheating. * Dobbs Elementary: A student told a teacher that the person who administered their CRCT gave them test answers. * Bethune Elementary: A teacher said that the principal allowed students who live out of zone to stay at the school if they had good scores. So much for Hall’s claim about the 2010 CRCTs. What about the 2011 tests? GOSA has not yet performed its statewide erasure analysis on these newest APS scores, and the special investigation did not address 2011. The AJC did publish its own analysis July 28. Five schools registered unlikely increases in their CRCT test scores this year. Three of them -- Toomer, White and West Manor elementary schools -- had also been named in the special investigator’s report for 2009 cheating. West Manor and White were also flagged in 2010. The odds of such increases range from about one in 700 to one in 21,000, according to the AJC analysis -- not as unlikely as gains in prior years, but still statistically unusual. School supporters say teaching methods or changing enrollment were behind the increases, but APS’ interim Superintendent Errol Davis and Mathers said they may deserve further scrutiny. Hall’s claim is clearly incorrect. So how do we rule? Hall submitted her commentary to Education Week on Aug. 9, according to its opinion editor. This is days after the AJC released its findings on the 2011 scores and more than a month after special investigators released their report. She had more than enough time to figure out that GOSA, special investigators and the AJC have questioned her results. Hall’s pants are more than singed. They’re blazing. She earns our lowest rating on this one. Pants on Fire.	None	Beverly Hall	None	None	None	2011-08-19T06:00:00	2011-08-10	['None']
pomt-04874	In June 2012 "we actually had more people go on Social Security Disability [85,000] ... than the 80,000 jobs that were created."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/aug/09/allen-west/us-rep-allen-west-d-fla-says-number-people-who-wen/	U.S. Rep. Allen West, a Florida Republican, was in Rhode Island last weekend on a fundraising trip. During a radio interview Aug. 1 on WHJJ’s "The Helen Glover Show," Glover turned the conversation toward a topic West has talked about often in recent months: the correlation between the number of people exhausting their unemployment benefits and new recipients of Social Security Disability benefits. "It’s unconscionable to think that in the month of June, the federal government [reported] 80,000 new jobs created but the little fact that no one is talking about is that we have 85,000 people go on Social Security Disability the same month." Said West: "So we actually had more people go on Social Security Disability -- which is different from Social Security -- than the 80,000 jobs that were created." "What we are doing is just making more people economically dependent on government," said West, "instead of having the right economic policies to make people economically free." West, a first-term congressman, is known for making provocative remarks. In April 2012 he garnered headlines when he said "about 78 to 81 members of the Democratic Party" were communists -- a reference, he said, to the liberal-leaning Congressional Progressive Caucus, which the Communist Party has publicly referred to as its ally. PolitiFact Florida gave that statement a Pants on Fire rating, saying West was using a guilt-by-association rationale and had failed to prove that any member of Congress was a communist. We wondered whether he was on more solid ground in his claim about Social Security Disability. We asked his office for his backup, but they never responded. Then we began our own research. We discovered that West got his numbers right. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 80,000 new jobs were created in June. And the Social Security Administration reported that 84,766 people were new beneficiaries of Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) that same month. (Since January, employment growth has averaged about 151,000 new jobs a month, the labor bureau reports. Over that same period, an average of 82,560 people per month went on SSDI.) SSDI is a federal program funded by workers’ payroll taxes, just like Social Security retirement. To be eligible, workers must qualify as physically or mentally disabled and must have also paid some of those Social Security taxes during their employment. Stephen C. Goss, chief actuary of the Social Security Administration, has said that in every recession since the 1970s, the number of people applying for Social Security Disability has increased as their unemployment benefits expire. In a talk in April before the National Academy of Social Insurance, in Washington, D.C., Goss explained the trend as a "temporary phenomenon for a cyclic economic downturn." "The [current] recession resulted in a lot of people becoming unemployed ... and when people become unemployed they seek a way of continuing to have income. And people who can qualify for our disabled worker benefits, of course, go ahead and apply. So we did have an increase in the number of applications." David H. Autor, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has served on the President’s Council on Economic Advisers, said in an e-mail: "I do not see this as a political issue." It is well-known that "when economic times are bad, many more people turn to SSDI out of desperation.... "The growth of SSDI is a long-standing problem and the recession has made it worse," Autor said. "The comparison between the two numbers (SSDI awards and jobs) is depressing." By the end of last year, more than 8.5 million Americans were receiving SSDI, roughly 1 million more than when the Great Recession began in December 2007, according to the Social Security Administration. Included in that figure were 35,905 disabled workers in Rhode Island receiving on average $1,115 a month, not counting the smaller state supplement they also receive. That growth is expected to continue; several studies have predicted that SSDI could run out of money by 2018. The Obama administration referred to the program’s costs when it argued for extending unemployment benefits last fall, saying in a December 2011 report: "workers on SSDI rarely return to the labor force, resulting in a loss to society of the economic contribution those workers could have made. Thus, keeping the long-term unemployed in the labor force should be a priority." Our ruling Rep. Allen West said that the number of people who became recipients of Social Security Disability in June (85,000) was higher than the number of jobs created that month (80,000).

pomt-05669	"While 9,000 state employees were added to the state’s payroll, Oregon’s revenue forecasts dropped by more than $4 billion."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2012/mar/16/dennis-richardson/did-oregon-add-9000-state-workers-while-revenue-dr/	PolitiFact Oregon enjoys receiving the newsletters of Rep. Dennis Richardson, R-Central Point. He’s written about China, federal timber reimbursements, and most usually, state spending. He is co-chairman with Rep. Peter Buckley, D-Ashland, of the House side of the Joint Ways and Means Committee. Richardson’s newsletters often include statements worthy of a fact check, such as this one about state workers receiving a catch-up raise in 1981. (Inflation was so high then it wasn’t really a catch-up.) A recent newsletter made us wonder, once again, about the size of state government: "The rising costs of state payroll expenses must be brought in line with the state’s revenue resources. According to Public Employment Retirement System (PERS) records, in 2006 Oregon had 38,000 employees and by 2011 the number of employees had increased to 47,000," he wrote. "Oregon finds itself in a conundrum. While 9,000 state employees were added to the state’s payroll, Oregon’s revenue forecasts dropped by more than $4 billion." Numbers. Drool. Are those employee figures correct? Did the revenue forecast really drop by $4 billion? And, most importantly, is it fair to juxtapose the two? Richardson said in a voicemail left at PolitiFact Oregon Central that Democrats built a government that we can no longer afford. "They expand government because their philosophy is that government can help more people," he said. "Mine is that that may be true, but you run out of money after a while." In his newsletter, Richardson cited the Public Employees Retirement System, which produces a report every year that lists the number of employees for public employers in Oregon. Richardson correctly cites the numbers attributed to the State of Oregon. But we decided to go further, because we’ve always been puzzled by the number of workers in state government. We pulled figures from the retirement system, and also from the Department of Administrative Services, which handles the executive branch of state government, and the Oregon University System. We tried to get the best apples-to-apples comparison, asking the agencies to weed out temporary workers and to focus on people eligible for retirement. We came up with a very odd table. Agency 2005-06 2006-07 2007-08 2008-09 2009-10 2010-11 % inc. DAS 30,849 31,046 32,383 32,994 33,795 33,124 7 OUS 13,460 13,590 13,807 14,234 13,720 15,136 12 Total 44,309 44,636 46,190 47,228 47,515 48,260 9 PERS 37,973 42,906 41,872 44,377 46,105 46,739 23 See the problem? If you add the executive branch and higher education numbers, the number of employees increased 9 percent, or nearly 4,000 people from fiscal year 2006 to 2011. If you look at the retirement system figures, it increased 23 percent, or by 8,800 people. Also, note that the 2005-06 retirement system number is much lower than that provided by the executive department and university system. Part of the reason for the discrepancy, says PERS spokesman David Crosley, is because university employees can opt for another retirement plan. Otherwise, he said the agency could not not explain the difference in growth. Let’s turn to the revenue shortfall. Richardson is correct that the revenue that the state estimated it would bring in dropped by $4 billion in that time, from $19.2 billion in March 2008 to $14.8 billion today. But we also want to point out that for all of 2007 and much of 2008, the forecast hovered around $19 billion. The forecast released in November 2008 was the first to show a drop, and then revenue tumbled from bad to worse. The executive branch went up, then down, in hiring from mid-2008 to mid-2011, with an overall growth of 0.3 percent. The real increase was in the number of university employees over the same period, 6 percent growth. Why? Well, when jobs are scarce, more students go to school. And when more students enroll, colleges and universities need more people to teach. That 6 percent growth in hiring corresponded with an enrollment growth from 86,500 to 96,960. (The Office of Economic Analysis has detailed posts on the topic.) And while some of these new hires may end up in Oregon’s retirement system, remember that they’re financed in large part by student tuition, which isn’t state tax money. Finally, we’re going to throw one last batch of numbers at you, this time from the Legislative Fiscal Office, which tracks all branches of state government as well as the universities. LFO 2005-07 2007-09 2009-11 2011-13 FTEs 47,900 49,600 51,700 50,500 We give you this additional information not to make your head hurt, but to give you different ways of viewing growth in state government. The increase in "full-time equivalent" budgeted positions is 5 percent, which is not as high as the 23 percent growth recorded by PERS. We contacted Richardson one last time, and shared our findings. He said he doesn’t have insider information as to why some numbers are higher or lower. But it doesn’t matter to him. The larger point holds: Government is not doing enough to limit costs when revenue is down. State universities, he said, could use technology and other tools to deliver classes more efficiently rather than increase tuition. "They should not be doing more of the same," he said. We can’t fault Richardson for using one set of figures to highlight growth, even though other sets suggest the growth has not been as steep. For some taxpayers, that we have more than 48,000 employees in state government and state universities is probably horrifying enough. Richardson’s underlying point that employment grew during a recession is accurate. In fact, the number of state and university employees is higher than that reported by the retirement system, as of June 30, 2011. But we downgrade our ruling for two reasons. The university system, state executive branch, and legislative fiscal office do not report the same magnitude in employee growth that’s reported by the retirement system. The 2005-06 starting point is low when compared with the other sources. We’ve asked the retirement system to explain, and they cannot find an answer. Also, if some of the increase can be attributed to increased demand at state universities -- where students in large part pay for the new hires -- it seems unfair to blame it all on Democrats’ inability to save. At the very least, that’s an important detail readers should know. For those reasons, we find his statement that the state added 9,000 employees while revenue dropped $4 billion to be partially accurate, but missing important details. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Dennis Richardson	None	None	None	2012-03-16T17:03:32	2012-02-17	['Oregon']
pomt-00311	Says "J.B. Pritzker’s tax plan" includes a "new tax per mile you drive with government tracking device."	false	/illinois/statements/2018/sep/23/bruce-rauner/rauner-veers-course-claiming-pritzker-proposed-mil/	In his re-election bid, Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner has sought to convince Illinois taxpayers that electing his Democratic opponent J.B. Pritzker spells trouble for their bottom line. In a recent campaign ad, the first-term incumbent doubled down on that narrative with several claims about Pritzker’s tax plan. The 30-second spot features a woman identified as Denise Smith who describes herself as a lifelong Illinoisan who says she may leave Illinois if Pritzker is elected because of his tax policies. While the ad contains no direct narration from the campaign, it features the following text: JB PRITZKER’S TAX PLAN INCOME TAX HIKE NEW TAX PER MILE YOU DRIVE WITH GOVERNMENT TRACKING DEVICE See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Rauner has long maintained policies Pritzker has said he supports would sock the middle class with an income tax hike. Last winter, we rated that claim Mostly False. Rauner’s mileage tax hit, on the other hand, is new. But the evidence isn’t in his favor there, either. What Pritzker said Most of the dollars Illinois puts toward road work come from a 19-cent-per-gallon tax drivers pay at the gas pump. But as cars become ever more fuel-efficient, fill-ups get less frequent, and that translates into less money collected by the state to fix roads. Some states have responded to the spread of hybrid and electric cars by launching experiments that study ways to record and tax miles traveled instead of gallons purchased. Part of the theory behind this is that electric cars, hybrids and other newer vehicles put the same wear and tear on highways as do gas guzzlers, but pay little to nothing for road repairs because their owners buy less fuel. Last January, during an interview with the Daily Herald editorial board, Pritzker said a vehicle mileage tax was an idea worth testing, but didn’t commit to any wide-scale implementation. Here’s what he said at the time about a VMT, or vehicle miles traveled tax, according to a video recording of his appearance posted by the newspaper: "You talked about a gas tax … We're challenged to come up with the dollars that we need for our highway system and for our roads. So in some states, they have done tests recently for a VMT tax ... It's only fair if you're on a road and traveling on that road that you should pay your fair share on the road like everybody else is paying. So I think it's something we should look at. We have to be careful about how it gets implemented and that's why it should only be a test at this point. I guess I'm letting you know that I recognize the challenge that we have in coming up with the dollars for our roads, particularly in that gas tax arena, and that we've got to look for different ways to fund it." Pritzker said much the same at a Downstate event in August attended by both governor candidates during which Rauner contended the Democrat had in fact proposed a mileage tax. "What I said is there are tests that have been done on this (tax) and I think we've got to look for how we're going to pay for infrastructure in the state," said Pritzker, according to the Decatur Herald & Review. "It's not anything definitive." What Rauner says Pritzker said When we reached out to Rauner’s campaign to ask when and where they’d heard Pritzker propose a mileage tax with a government tracking device, spokesman Justin Giorgio did not directly answer. "Pritzker has expressed support for a test program," Giorgio wrote in an email. "And in every other case, there has been a government tracking device." Likewise, Rauner chose his words a little more carefully during a debate last week televised on NBC 5. "He was on the record, proposing, saying we all should look at a driving tax," Rauner asserted at one point. So neither Rauner nor his spokesman now go as far as the campaign’s ad to contend Pritzker has actually proposed a mileage tax as part of his tax plan, let alone put forth a specific method for taxing those miles. As for Giorgio’s suggestion that all other pilot programs have required a "government tracking device," that is as misleading as it is sinister sounding. Oregon launched a permanent but voluntary mileage tax program in 2015. Participants, who are reimbursed state fuel tax for paying the mileage tax instead, can choose from multiple options to track their miles including a plug-in device that records mileage but does not track location. A total of nine states have run or are planning pilot programs to explore the possibility of taxing mileage, although only Oregon has implemented fees so far. Other states have also given participants a variety of choices when it came to recording their miles, including some that involve no tracking device—GPS-enabled or otherwise. California, for instance, conducted a nine-month study in which participants were allowed to sign up for odometer checks or purchase permits for a set number of days in lieu of more high-tech options. Our ruling Rauner’s ad says "Pritzker’s tax plan" includes a "new tax per mile you drive with government tracking device." But Pritzker hasn’t endorsed any plan as of yet when it comes to measuring and taxing miles driven and Rauner in a televised debate last week appeared to back away from directly claiming otherwise, although his ad is still running. Pritzker has simply said it’s an idea worth exploring as other states test the concept, given the erosion in collections from the gas tax long relied on to pay for road upkeep. And he has said nothing about a tracking device, which is only one of several options employed in mileage tracking tests conducted in other states. We rate Rauner’s claim False.

pomt-00917	On immigration, "the president said 22 times, 22 times, that he couldn't do what he eventually did."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/01/john-boehner/boehner-obama-said-22-times-he-couldnt-do-immigrat/	Republican House leaders fanned out on the Sunday shows to defend a stop-gap measure to fund the Department of Homeland Security in their ongoing fight against President Barack Obama's executive action on immigration. They did not stray from talking points. TV audiences Sunday heard one specific number several times as hosts pressed the GOP lawmakers to justify the chaos over funding for the Department of Homeland Security. "The president said 22 times, 22 times, that he couldn't do what he eventually did," House Speaker John Boehner said on CBS’ Face the Nation. Both Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Majority Whip Steve Scalise repeated the "22 times" talking point on NBC’s Meet the Press and Fox News Sunday, respectively. Even Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, one of 52 Republicans who opposed a three-week funding plan, used the figure to defend his House Freedom Caucus’ actions on CNN’s State of the Union. PolitiFact wanted to see where the number comes from and just how accurate it is. What we’re talking about The controversy stems from Obama’s Nov. 20, 2014, announcement that he would delay deportations of unauthorized immigrants who have lived in the country for more than five years but have children who are citizens or have green cards. More than 4 million people could qualify. An applicant could qualify for a work permit and avoid being deported for three years at a time if he or she can pass a background check and pay a fee. The decision is bound for higher court battles after a Texas federal judge issued a temporary injunction on the action, saying it may have violated procedural rules for using executive power. This action came on top of Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in 2012, an executive action to protect "dreamers," or people brought here illegally as children and have not committed crimes. That move, too, was viewed by critics as an abuse of power, but supporters said it helped provide a path to citizenship for hundreds of thousands of residents. After Obama’s post-midterm elections announcement on immigration, Boehner’s office unleashed a Buzzfeed-style blog post detailing "22 Times President Obama Said He Couldn’t Ignore or Create His Own Immigration Law." What’s on Boehner’s list Our PolitiFact Texas colleagues dissected Boehner’s list for similar fact-checks of U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, the Republican who led the legal challenge of Obama’s actions when he was still attorney general. PolitiFact Texas tracked down each of the citations in Boehner’s post, comparing what they said Obama said with transcripts and news stories. In a nutshell, the majority of the examples are of Obama saying he did not have power to do more on immigration without Congress. Others, as we’ll explain in a moment, say something more nuanced or aren’t specific to immigration. We won’t go through every quote that supports Boehner’s point here, but here are a few we culled from a document created by PolitiFact Texas: In September 2012, Obama was asked if he would follow up his recent protective move for students by doing something similar for non-criminal immigrants such as the parents of U.S.-born children. Obama replied that "as the head of the executive branch, there’s a limit to what I can do… we’re still going to, ultimately, have to change the laws in order to avoid some of the heartbreaking stories that you see coming up occasionally," as in parents deported. (No. 13 on Boehner’s list.) At a presidential debate in October 2012, Obama and Mitt Romney were asked: "What do you plan on doing with immigrants without their green card that are currently living here as productive members of society?" Obama said: "I've done everything that I can on my own." (No. 14 on Boehner’s list.) In a January 2013 Telemundo interview, Obama was asked why he couldn’t protect mothers living here without authorization from deportation as he had served law-abiding students. "I’m not a king," Obama replied, akin to his response the same month to a similar query from Univision. "You know, my job as the head of the executive branch ultimately is to carry out the law. And-- you know, when it comes to enforcement of our immigration laws-- we’ve got some discretion. We can prioritize-- what we do. But we can’t simply ignore the law." (No. 16 on Boehner’s list.) So clearly there are examples of Obama saying he couldn’t do more with executive action, then later doing exactly that. That’s why PolitiFact previously rated Obama’s claim that "my position hasn’t changed" as False. What should not be counted But also included on Boehner’s list of 22 are quotes where Obama was either suggesting his executive powers did not have hard limits or was silent on his executive power on immigration. Here are a few problems with quotes included on Boehner’s list. In two instances during his 2008 presidential campaign, Obama criticized "signing statements" used by President George W. Bush that interpret laws, but he did not bring up immigration. Immigration was also not part of his reply to a question at a 2010 MTV/BET event when he said, "I can’t simply ignore laws that are out there," in response to a question about "don’t ask, don’t tell." (Nos. 1, 2 and 5.) In September 2011, with his deferred-action plan on the horizon, Obama reiterated that he cannot just change laws unilaterally in response to a question about possible administrative relief for students who don’t have legal residency. But he hinted that there might be room within his authority, saying, "what we can do is to prioritize enforcement, since there are limited enforcement resources." (No. 12 on Boehner’s list.) Obama’s July 2013 Univision interview hit similar notes when he was asked if he could grant amnesty to the undocumented population. He called for a legislative solution and said "probably not," adding, "I can do some things and have done some things that make a difference in the lives of people by determining how our enforcement should focus." (No. 18 on Boehner’s list.) In August 2014, Obama told reporters he may "scour our authorities to try to make progress" without congressional cooperation. Obama said, "We’re going to make sure that every time we take one of these steps that we are working within the confines of my executive power. But I promise you the American people don’t want me just standing around twiddling my thumbs and waiting for Congress to get something done." (No. 22 on Boehner’s list.) Asked why Boehner continues to cite 22 examples, spokesman Michael Steel told PolitiFact "we obviously stand by" the count. Pressed to explain why, he said, "Obviously, we're just going to agree to disagree about the ‘22 times’ figure, which we feel is accurate." The bigger picture Whether the real number is 22, 15 or something less than that is more complicated by the specifics of Boehner’s claim. Boehner's claim is Obama said he couldn’t do "what he eventually did." Experts we talked to noted that Obama was not always so specific in the comments Boehner and his team cited. Boehner’s count factors in both instances of Obama talking about how he could not legalize or deport the entire undocumented population as well as more limited executive actions to relieve smaller populations. "It gives me a headache," said Anna O. Law, a CUNY Brooklyn College political science professor, of the post, "because they’re playing semantics." Alex Nowrasteh, a Cato Institute immigration analyst, said he did not know what to make of the "very political" claim. Ultimately, much of it depends on your specific interpretation of each quote. Our ruling Boehner said, "The president said 22 times, 22 times, that he couldn't do what he eventually did." Boehner's broader point -- that Obama said one thing about executive action but did another -- is accurate. But he should refrain from the rhetorical flourish of saying Obama said it 22 times. We rate this claim Mostly True. Clarification: This item was updated on March 2, 2015, to better explain the ruling of a federal judge in Texas.

pomt-07402	"There are legitimate and widespread anomalies, and widespread questions about the conduct of (the Wisconsin Supreme Court) election, most visibly in Waukesha County, but also in counties around the state."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/apr/29/joanne-kloppenburg/joanne-kloppenburg-says-anomalies-were-widespread-/	Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate JoAnne Kloppenburg declared victory on election night when preliminary, unofficial returns put her 204 votes ahead of Justice David Prosser. Fifteen days later, she sought a statewide recount after the official county-by-county returns showed her trailing by more than 7,300 votes out of 1.5 million cast. In explaining her decision, Kloppenburg told reporters that a recount may not get her over the top, but would shine a light on "an election that right now seems to so many people to be suspect." She also went on the offensive, raising questions about the legitimacy of the vote count around the state. "There are legitimate and widespread anomalies," said Kloppenburg, a state Justice Department attorney, "and widespread questions about the conduct of this election, most visibly in Waukesha County, but also in counties around the state." The Waukesha County problems are well known: A vote-tallying glitch belatedly boosted Prosser’s total in the official count by almost 7,600. County Clerk Kathy Nickolaus, a Republican in a GOP stronghold, didn’t report her error for more than a day after the election. Given the outrage over the Waukesha incident, Kloppenburg seems on solid ground suggesting that there are "widespread questions" about the election. But are there "widespread anomalies" in the statewide count? That’s a much different claim and one we can check. In order to justify her claim, we think Kloppenburg has to show that numerous questionable situations remain that are "irregular" or "abnormal" -- a dictionary definition of "anomalous." In addition to the Waukesha situation, Kloppenburg at the news conference cited an "undervote" in Milwaukee and Racine; ballot shortages and long lines in Fond du Lac and several other municipalities; and changes in the unofficial vote totals in Winnebago County. Let’s take a look: "Undervotes": This is when a voter chooses not to vote in all the races listed on a ballot -- creating an "undervote" in one race compared with another. For instance, this year in the city of Milwaukee, the Milwaukee County executive’s race drew about 2,000 more votes than the Kloppenburg-Prosser race at the top of the ticket. Kloppenburg campaign manager Melissa Mulliken said Racine and Milwaukee had an unusually high undervote rate in the statewide court race compared with local races there. "You wonder why," Mulliken said. "Did voting machines misread ballots?" But in the city of Milwaukee, the 2011 court contest was not the largest court-race undervote in even the last three years. In 2008, when Michael Gableman defeated incumbent Louis Butler for the high court, the Scott Walker-Lena Taylor race for county executive drew 3,500 more votes. A review going back further shows the court races sometimes draw more and sometimes less than other contests, depending on the competitiveness of the races involved. In Racine, the Kloppenburg-Prosser race drew fewer votes than the Racine mayor’s race. It was about 150 votes short, or 1 percent. That, too, has happened before: In 2009, Justice Shirley Abrahamson’s breeze to re-election drew substantially fewer votes than a special primary election for Racine mayor. But in 2008, the Gableman-Butler race drew just slightly more than a statewide referendum in Racine. Not much of a pattern there. Neil Albrecht, deputy director of the Milwaukee Election Commission, said undervoting is not really an anomaly. "It’s more a reflection with people's comfort and familiarity with certain contests and the candidates," he said. UW-Madison political scientist Barry Burden agreed. "‘Dropoff’ is the term we use," said Burden, who studies election administration. "It doesn’t surprise me at all. That’s reasonable to expect when you have a local race that is grabbing a lot of attention." (Local conditions played out the other way in another Democratic hotbed, Dane County. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s Craig Gilbert reported that 10,000 more people voted in the court race than in a county exec’s race that was not even close.) Ballot shortages: The unusually high voter turnout in the high court race -- at least 14 points higher statewide than predicted -- fueled ballot shortages in various communities. Kloppenburg cited Fond du Lac County. State election officials ordered the clerk in the city of Fond du Lac to issue substitute ballots because of shortages, and the resulting lines at touchscreen machines and delays in voting. Our research found other shortages in the counties of Eau Claire, Sheboygan and Winnebago. Together, they involved more than 2,000 votes on photocopied ballots that had to be hand counted. How unusual is this? There are mixed views. Burden said the use of photocopied ballots is fairly common but rarely noticed unless a race is close. It’s common enough for the state to have a law that sets out the procedure for issuing substitute ballots when shortages occur, said Reid Magney, spokesman for the state’s Governmental Accountability Board. One clerk, Lisa Freiberg of Fond du Lac County, said it was "very unusual" in her county to resort to copying paper ballots. Fond du Lac City Clerk Sue Strands, who orders ballots, agreed. Strands said she considers her vote count solid. She said if there was an "anomaly" it was limited to four instances in which voters tried to put their copied ballot into voting machines. They jammed. Kloppenburg’s campaign says the question is how such ballots were counted. There is some concern about reliable counts of photocopied ballots, because they can’t be run through voting machines, election clerks say. That necessitated some hand-counting on a busy election night. Discrepancies in unofficial results: It’s clear the big Waukesha County vote tally error on election night was unusual. PolitiFact Wisconsin earlier examined a Nickolaus claim that errors in that part of the process are "common." We found that her error was extreme but not unprecedented, and we rated her claim Barely True. It’s important to note that errors such as the Waukesha County tally and the 1,100-vote miscommunication in the unofficial tally from Winnebago County are reviewed -- and typically corrected -- in the official vote canvasses done by the counties. That process -- plus a special state probe of Waukesha County -- is now complete and state officials say the Waukesha and Winnebago discrepancies have been cleared up. So if that verification process is already done, does that leave Kloppenburg with much justification for including Waukesha on her problem list? She points out the state will do a deeper investigation of Nickolaus’ past work -- and that the preliminary state probe did find a handful of discrepancies in the county’s canvass of write-in votes. So, has Kloppenburg supported her claim? Her "undervote" claims do not hold up; they are not anomalous based on historical patterns. Errors in the unofficial tally were mostly routine and by now have likely been corrected by the standard post-election canvasses. Waukesha County’s situation was rare, but it is only one county, and the big discrepancy there has already been cleared up, according to state elections officials. In Kloppenburg’s favor: Ballot shortages -- though not rare and not by themselves evidence of miscounts -- did happen in multiple areas and are by no means the norm. And the Waukesha County situation, while already investigated at length, still has a few loose ends, and questions remain about Nickolaus’ methods. So, Kloppenburg’s claim had an element of truth but skipped critical facts that would give a different impression. Some might call it mostly false. But on the Truth-O-Meter, that’s the definition of Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	JoAnne Kloppenburg	None	None	None	2011-04-29T09:00:00	2011-04-20	['Waukesha_County,_Wisconsin', 'Wisconsin_Supreme_Court']

And since that never happened, it’s also fake news that there were five family members inside that house who came out of the ordeal without major injuries. A website called Daily Native American, dailynative.us, posted the fabricated story on Aug. 6, 2017, but the claims have circulated for years. Satirical website worldnewsdailyreport.com posted the same story back in 2015. "A family from Tulsa, Oklahoma, underwent the scariest experience of their life yesterday, when their mobile home was carried over 130 miles by a tornado, landing in a rural Kansas area. Five members of the same family were inside the building during its ‘flight’, and all of them have miraculously survived without injuries," said the dailynative.us post. "41-year old Dorothy Williams, was at home with her husband, her son, and her two brothers, when their mobile home was lifted off the ground by an F4 tornado." The story claims the tornado carried the house for more than four hours "sometimes at altitude of more than 1,000 feet," across northern Colorado, southern Kansas and then dropped it on a car outside of Wichita, "129.5 miles (208.5 kilometers) away from its point of origin." We asked the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration what they thought of the dailynative.us post. "That's not possible," said Harold Brooks, senior research scientist at NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory. Most tornadoes last less than 10 minutes and travel an average 3.5 miles. Stories of papers, checks and other feather-light objects traveling 100 miles do sometimes check out. But heavy objects cannot cover the same ground. Brooks said even in the "most violent events," wind could not usher a Tulsa mobile home northwest over Colorado before landing near Wichita in southern Kansas. "That’s a rare direction for even paper to get thrown over significant distances," he said. Dailynative.us does not feature an "About Us" page detailing who’s behind it or what is it’s purpose. Allusions to The Wizard of Oz did not go unnoticed to some readers. "Sorry is it just me or has someone else heard all this before? …Dorothy? The house lands safely (somewhere in Kansas)? … was she wearing red shoes by any chance? And was there a wicked witch in the car that the house landed on?" wrote a worldnewsdailyreport.com reader in August 2017.

pomt-06162	Nevada has been recently ranked No. 1 in "unemployment, foreclosures, violent crime, personal bankruptcy and divorce."	true	/florida/statements/2011/dec/16/florida-chamber-commerce/fl-chamber-ceo-says-nevada-no-1-unemployment-forec/	As the January 2012 state legislative session draws near, supporters and opponents are organizing to make their voices heard about a proposed bill that would allow three massive casino resorts in South Florida. On Dec. 8, 2011, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam -- both Republicans -- held a press conference with opponents to publicly denounce the gambling bill. In an article about that press conference posted on WTSP 10 News, a Tampa Bay station, Mark Wilson, the CEO of the Florida Chamber of Commerce, piped up about his opposition, too. The report paraphrased Wilson as saying that the casinos would take money away from existing businesses and lead to other problems. He pointed to the state of Nevada, where gambling is prevalent, as an example. Nevada, he said, "can keep their recent No. 1 rankings in unemployment, foreclosures, violent crime, personal bankruptcy and divorce. They can keep their No. 1 rankings." For this fact-check, we won't begin to address whether gambling is to blame for the statistics Wilson cited. We are examining whether he had them correct. Wilson's spokeswoman, Edie Ousley, said that the unemployment and foreclosure data came from 2011 data, that the personal bankruptcy statistic was from 2010 and the violent crime and divorce data was from 2009. She sent us a document from CQ Press that pulled numbers from many sources including the census, Small Business Administration, FBI and administrative office of the U.S. courts. Katy Sorenson, a former Miami-Dade County Commissioner who is now the CEO of The Good Government Initiative at the University of Miami, also cited similar statistics attributed to the Congressional District Ranking Book in a guest editorial in the Miami Herald Dec. 10. We will use CQ's research as well as our own to look at each category cited by Wilson: Unemployment: The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that in October 2011 unemployment in Nevada was 13.4 percent -- the highest state (the list includes Puerto Rico at 16.1 percent but Puerto Rico is a territory not a state). Foreclosures: RealtyTrac shows a map of foreclosures nationwide as of October 2011 which shows for Nevada one home in every 180 is in foreclosure -- the highest in the country in terms of the ratio. (Nevada isn't the highest in sheer numbers -- there are more foreclosures in more populous states such as California and Florida.) Violent crime: The FBI's 2010 statistics show 17,841 violent crimes (murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault) in the state of Nevada, for a rate of 660.6 per 100,000 occupants. Nevada's rate was the second highest in the country behind the District of Columbia, which had a rate of 1,330.2. (Nevada wasn't the second highest in sheer number of crimes because some states with larger populations, for example New York and California, had higher numbers of total violent crimes.) Since the chamber said Wilson was referring to 2009, we looked at the FBI's violent crime report for 2009, too, and found again the District of Columbia at No. 1 at 1345.9 and Nevada's rate at 702.2. The District of Columbia isn't a state so we think it's fair here to say Nevada had the highest crime rate amongst the states. Personal bankruptcy: Using data collected from U.S. Bankruptcy Courts during a 12-month period ending in September 2010, Nevada ranked No. 1 in terms of the personal bankruptcy rate. The state had 1,121 nonbusiness bankruptcies per 100,000 population. We found bankruptcy statistics for the 12-month period ending in September 2011, but it showed the number of bankruptcy cases -- not the rate. Divorce: CQ used 2009 data from the National Center for Health Statistics, which found that Nevada had the highest divorce rate among states reporting (6.7 per 1,000 population). We corroborated the data through the National Center. However, six states did not collect the information for 2009. Center spokesman Jeffrey Lancashire said the group no longer collects detailed divorce data because not all the states collect the information. "The exact reasons vary from state to state, but likely it is budget-related," he said in an e-mail. "But when a state like California doesn’t collect the information, it is real problematic to produce good national data." The census also measures marital status rates for each state. The census shows that Nevada had a divorce rate of 12.3 percent for males and 14.6 percent for females between 2005 and 2007. According to the census, Wyoming had a slightly higher rate of divorced males -- 12.6 percent -- but Nevada was No. 1 for divorced females. Another product created by the U.S. Census Bureau, the 2010 American Community Survey showed that Nevada had a 12.4 percent divorce rate for women -- placing it in a tie for 9th place with Tennessee -- and a 14 percent divorce rate for men -- ranking it first. Which divorce statistic should we give most weight? Robert Bernstein, a spokesman with the census, suggested that we use the National Center for Health Statistics data because that represents the official divorce rates and is based on vital statistics while the American Community Survey data are based on responses by survey respondents. That puts Wilson on solid footing. Our ruling Mark Wilson, the CEO of the Florida Chamber of Commerce, said that Nevada has been recently ranked No. 1 in unemployment, foreclosures, violent crime, personal bankruptcy and divorce. The state of Nevada is clearly No. 1 in its unemployment and foreclosure rate -- and it's the highest for violent crime, too, if we omit the District of Columbia, which isn't a state. CQ's analysis shows Nevada at the top spot for personal bankruptcy. The statistics on divorce are somewhat more complicated but one recent source, the National Center for Health Statistics, concluded Nevada's overall divorce rate was the highest in the country in 2009 among the states for which such data was available.

pomt-01851	"Radio Marti and TV Marti have spent more than $500 million to reach less than 1 percent of the Cuban population."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/14/lawrence-odonnell/msnbcs-odonnell-washington-has-spent-over-500-mill/	Over the decades since the Cuban revolution, American feelings toward our closest Communist neighbor have mellowed, if only just a bit. According to a Gallup poll, antipathy toward restoring ties with Cuba has inched down since the 1970s. Other research suggests a generational shift is underway as U.S.-born Cuban Americans come of age and move away from the firm anti-communist line of the Republican Party. MSNBC host Lawrence O’Donnell took aim at the American broadcasts designed to stir discontent with the Cuban government, Radio Marti and TV Marti. Both seek to offer Cubans an alternative source of news. O’Donnell cast them as a colossal waste of taxpayer money. "Radio Marti and TV Marti have spent more than $500 million to reach less than 1 percent of the Cuban population, and as far as we can tell, change their minds about nothing," O’Donnell said on July 8, 2014. "No politician who seriously aspires to the president who will dare to say a word about this wasted $500 million, because when it comes to Cuba policy, the American government is still crazy after all these years." We can’t know whether these American broadcasts have shaped the opinions of Cubans, but we can look into O’Donnell’s claim about the money and the market penetration. Limited audience data O’Donnell’s colleagues at MSNBC pointed to a 2009 Government Accountability Office report. The GAO works on behalf of Congress to assess whether government programs spend their money wisely and achieve what they were set up to do. The 2009 study focused on TV Marti but at the very top, it spoke to the total spending. "More than $500 million that has been spent over the years on broadcasting to Cuba," the GAO analysts wrote. We found a 2011 GAO report that put total spending at $660 million since the launch of Radio Marti in the mid 1980s. As for the television operation’s audience, the 2009 GAO report said that the best available research shows that "it is small." The International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB) oversees the Marti project. "Less than 1 percent of respondents to IBB telephone surveys since 2003 reported that they had watched TV Martí during the past week," the report said. "Notably, results from the 2006 and 2008 telephone surveys show no increase in reported TV Martí viewership following the launch of AeroMarti and DirecTV broadcasting in 2006." AeroMarti was a $5 million a year effort to broadcast from an airplane. It has since ended. DirecTV made programs available to those Cubans with illegal dish antennas. Measuring audience size in Cuba, for either television or radio, faces a huge hurdle -- tuning in could get you in trouble with the government. The GAO report notes, this makes it difficult to get reliable responses. Daniel Walsh is a communications professor at Appalachian State University who has studied America’s broadcast efforts in Cuba. "There is no real way to get valid audience numbers for Radio Marti," Walsh said. "I would say that 1 percent may be a bit low but not far off. Some Cubans, including government officials, listen to Radio Marti but don't admit it." The International Broadcasting Bureau hired a firm to place calls to Cuba, mainly from Costa Rica. But according to the Cuban telecomm company Etesca, there are only about 2 million cell phone lines and about 1.3 million landlines. With a total population of more than 11 million, phone calls are unlikely to reach a representative sample. A 2010 Senate Foreign Relations Committee report summarized recent survey results for the radio service. "Fewer than 2 percent of respondents in 2003, 2005, and 2006 said they listened to Radio Marti during the previous week," the report said. "In 2008, fewer than 1 percent of respondents said they listened to Radio Marti during the previous week." The numbers have not always been so low. Philip Peters served in the State Department during the Reagan and Bush administrations. In congressional testimony in 2002, Peters said he believed in the project’s mission but drew attention to an "alarming statistic." "Radio Marti’s audience share has plummeted to 5 percent in 2001, down from 9 percent in 2000 and 71 percent 10 years ago, according to professional survey research commissioned by the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), Radio Marti’s oversight body," Peters said. According to the GAO, concerns about the validity of these audience measures led the IBB to halt telephone surveys after 2008. The division that runs Radio and TV Marti, the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, has interviewed recent arrivals from Cuba. Their results show significantly higher penetration. About 30 percent said they had listened to Radio Marti at some point during their last six months in Cuba. However, about half of those said they stopped because Cuban jamming made it difficult to listen. About 4 percent said they had watched TV Marti. Program administrators cautioned that these results also fail to give an accurate view of market penetration because the total number of people surveyed is small, less than 400, and people who have chosen to leave Cuba do not represent a random sample. Nicholas Cull, a professor at the University of Southern California, has studied the Marti project and believes it lacks an appreciable following in Cuba. "Everything I've heard suggests it is tiny," Cull said. Cuban jamming efforts present a consistent challenge to American government broadcasting. The Cuban government can effectively block reception by broadcasting on the same frequency as the American programs but at a much higher power. The U.S. response has been to shift frequencies up to 10 times a day (with an unknown impact on listenership), and to build a digital distribution strategy that uses cell phone text messaging, DVDs and flash drive technologies. According to the Broadcasting Board of Governors 2013 annual report, text messages and emails "reach nearly 1 million Cubans each week." However, a spokesperson said it is unclear how many messages are read. Staff told PunditFact there are more than 660,000 cell phone numbers and more than 360,000 email addresses in their distribution database. They said they harvested this information from the Web and online sources and verified that the numbers and addresses were still active. The texting and email effort began three years ago. According to government data, there are around 1 million cell phones in total in Cuba. The size of the Marti database might represent significant market penetration, although staff said "the vast majority of the cell phones and emails we have in our distribution lists did not opt-in." That is, the Cubans did not request the information the Marti service offers. About 45,000 texts go out each month. In the past six months, the Office of Cuba Broadcasting has received 349 texts. Staff said Cuba is able to block sensitive messages based on key words. The International Broadcasting Bureau has developed applications for smart phones for users to share messages, but the Cuban government moved only a few months ago to begin email access over its wireless network. The cost is very high, about $1.20 per megabyte. The average worker makes, officially, about $20 a month. Our ruling O’Donnell said that the United States had spent over $500 million to reach less than 1 percent of the Cuban population. The weight of the GAO findings, the assessment from one of the program’s early supporters, and outside experts largely confirm O’Donnell’s numbers. If anything, the government has spent more than O’Donnell said. He might have overstated how small the audience actually is, but independent government reviewers conclude that the audience is small. The new distribution methods of text and email come with some impressive numbers, but there is no verification that a substantial portion of these messages get through. While the quality of the data can be questioned, the numbers that do exist suggest O’Donnell was largely correct. We rate the claim Mostly True. Update: The Cuban telecomm company Etesca said there are approximately 3.3 million cell phone and land lines in Cuba. This story has been updated to reflect that point.

pomt-09681	Says she couldn't take stimulus money because it required "universal building codes."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/16/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-claims-weatherization-money-stimulus-r/	Sarah Palin has been a vocal opponent of the economic stimulus package ever since it was proposed by President Barack Obama, and she makes that point again in her new book, Going Rogue . Back in March 2009, then-Gov. Palin called the stimulus plan a "bribe" intended to "grow government" and she vowed to turn down as much as a third of the money available to Alaska. But the Republican-controlled Alaska Legislature fought her on it, and she ultimately accepted all but 3 percent of the more than $900 million available to Alaska. The 3 percent that she vetoed was $28.6 million in federal stimulus money for weatherization and other projects to make new and existing homes and buildings more energy efficient. She claimed then, as she does again in her book, that the money had not just string but "ropes" attached to it that would require the state to adopt universal building codes. Here's how she described it in the book: "The documents clearly stated that acceptance of the funds required the adoption and enforcement of energy building codes," she wrote. "Universal building codes -- in Alaska! A practical, libertarian haven full of independent Americans who did not desire 'help' from government busybodies. A state full of hardy pioneers who did not like taking orders from the feds telling us to change our laws. A state so geographically diverse that one-size-fits-all codes simply wouldn't work." At PolitiFact, we looked at that claim in some detail back in early June after she said the money would require "universal energy building codes for Alaska, kind of a one-size-fits-all building code that isn't going to work up there in Alaska." Many state legislators in Alaska said Palin was overstating things. Even a number of Republicans in the Alaska Legislature said Palin was wrong. In fact, Anchorage Republican Rep. Mike Hawker was quoted in the Anchorage Daily News saying that he believed Palin "had to do something to save face" after initially promising to turn away a third of the stimulus money, but then vetoing just 3 percent. But Palin stuck to her claim, and pointed to a provision in the stimulus that tied the energy efficiency money to assurances that the state or local governments "will implement" a "building energy code for residential buildings that meets or exceeds the most recently published International Energy Conservation Code, or achieves equivalent or greater energy savings" as well as building energy codes for commercial buildings throughout the state that meet federal standards. She vetoed the funds even after getting a clarifying letter from Steven G. Chalk of the Department of Energy, who stated that the stimulus provision recognizes that not every state has statewide building codes, and that the governor does not have the authority to force local governments to implement building codes. In those cases, Chalk wrote, it's sufficient for the governor to simply "promote" the codes. It is enough, he wrote, for the state to work with local governments to create model energy efficiency standards, but no municipality would be forced to adopt any new codes. As for Palin's claims of "one-size-fits-all" building codes, Chalk wrote that the provision "provides flexibility with regard to building codes" and "expressly includes standards other than those cited so long as the standards achieve equivalent energy savings." In August, the Alaska Legislature voted in an emergency session to override Palin's veto of the energy money, an unusual event that requires 75 percent approval. As for Palin's claim that Alaska is a "practical, libertarian haven full of independent Americans who did not desire 'help' from government busybodies," the Associated Press noted recently that for a state that doesn't "desire" help from the federal government, they get an awful lot of it. A study by the Tax Foundation of federal taxes paid versus spending received, by state, in 2005 -- the latest year available -- found that Alaska received $1.84 for every federal tax dollar it sent to Washington (ranking Alaska third in the nation that year). It was the 20th year in a row that Alaska got more back from the government than residents paid in federal taxes. The wording in the stimulus bill related to the weatherization money may have left room for Palin's concerns, but the letter from the Department of Energy made clear that universal building codes were not going to be forced upon state and local governments as a condition for accepting the federal money. Palin's opposition to the funding may give her license to claim she opposed the stimulus plan -- even though it was only a small portion of Alaska's funding -- but her reasoning doesn't jibe with the assurances from the Department of Energy. We rule her claim False.	None	Sarah Palin	None	None	None	2009-11-16T18:28:27	2009-11-17	['None']
pomt-04627	Says Congressman Jon Runyan has a "plan to raise Medicare costs $6,400 a year."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/sep/16/shelley-adler/medicare-and-football-democratic-congressional-can/	A former offensive tackle for the Philadelphia Eagles, U.S. Rep. Jon Runyan has apparently found new opponents to tackle on a front lawn or block from a pharmacy counter: senior citizens on Medicare. That’s at least the message in a new TV ad from his Democratic challenger, Shelley Adler, who is looking to unseat the Republican congressman in the Nov. 6 general election. The ad, released Sept. 12 on YouTube, features a mock sports broadcast about Runyan’s support for a Medicare reform proposal from Wisconsin congressman and Republican vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan. Two broadcasters deliver a play-by-play account as a man wearing a suit and a football helmet tackles an elderly man mowing his lawn, and then holds back two senior citizens struggling to grab medicine from a pharmacist. One broadcaster says, "No one likes his plan to raise Medicare costs $6,400 a year," and the other broadcaster adds, "But Runyan won’t budge." But Adler deserves a penalty flag of her own. That $6,400 estimate applies to Ryan’s old Medicare plan -- not the current one -- and the TV ad wrongly suggests those higher costs would impact current Medicare beneficiaries. Adler spokesman Michael Muller argued the "ad speaks to the long term future of the program," and defended using the $6,400 figure. "This is what he voted for. Voters have a right to know that," Muller told us. "His record is what it is." The outdated figure cited in the TV ad is based on an April 2011 report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. The think tank used data from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to analyze the Medicare plan put forward by Ryan in early 2011. Under that plan, future beneficiaries, starting in 2022, would not be allowed to enroll in the current Medicare program. Instead, they would receive "premium support" payments to put toward private insurance premiums. The think tank report estimated that a beneficiary in 2022 would pay $6,350 more in out-of-pocket costs for private coverage than under traditional Medicare. But here’s the problem: Ryan has since revised his plan, making changes to how those payments would be calculated and how they could be spent. Under Ryan’s latest plan, future beneficiaries, starting in 2023, could use the payments for private plans as well as a plan that acts like traditional Medicare. Also, the payments would be based on the second least-expensive plan available, and slightly more generous in how fast they would increase. So, the payments should be enough to cover the two cheapest plans offered. As for Runyan, he has voted in favor of both versions of Ryan’s Medicare plan. But the budget office has not analyzed how this latest proposal would specifically affect beneficiary costs. In a March 2012 report, the budget office said "beneficiaries might face higher costs," but added the "CBO does not have the capability at this time to estimate such effects for the specified path of Medicare spending." Still, it’s misleading for Adler to cite a figure based on an old version of Ryan’s proposal. Another problem with Adler’s TV ad is it fails to mention how that $6,400 estimate only applies to future beneficiaries. Current beneficiaries would be able to remain in the current Medicare program and face no premium support payments. But viewers are left to infer the payments and the $6,400 figure would affect people already on Medicare. Calling the ad "dishonest," Runyan spokesman Chris Russell said in an e-mail that the congressman "voted to protect Medicare for current seniors and preserve it for future generations." Our ruling Adler’s TV ad claimed Runyan has a "plan to raise Medicare costs $6,400 a year," suggesting the higher costs would impact current beneficiaries. But that figure is based on an old version of the Medicare reform plan, and does not account for changes made in the latest proposal. Also, that estimate does not apply to current beneficiaries, who could remain in the existing program. Since Runyan voted for the old plan, we give Adler’s statement a Mostly False.

pomt-05821	"'Wrong precinct' rules exacerbate our provisional ballot problems (and) HB 194 does nothing to solve the wrong-precinct problem."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/feb/20/kathleen-clyde/state-rep-kathleen-clyde-says-new-election-law-doe/	Provisional ballots are used in general elections when there is a question about a voter's eligibility at a polling station. Poll workers allow the person to vote with a provisional ballot until the problem is sorted out, and if the person is an eligible voter, then the ballot is counted. PolitiFact Ohio recently checked -- and rated as True -- the claim that Ohio has one of the highest provisional ballot rates in the country, and that many of those ballots go uncounted. State Rep. Kathleen Clyde of Kent raised the issue in discussion about House Bill 194, the controversial overhaul of Ohio election laws that was passed last spring but will go on the ballot in November as a referendum issue. Clyde pointed to numbers in the Election Day Survey Report of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission showing that the biggest reason for provisional balloting in Ohio is change of address. But, she added, the problem of provisional ballots and uncounted votes is worsened by Ohio's "wrong precinct" rules. "Wrong precinct rules exacerbate our provisional ballot problems," she said in an email. "HB 194 does nothing to solve the wrong-precinct problem." Rather, she said, the law makes it worse by eliminating the requirement that poll workers must direct a voter to their correct precinct." PolitiFact Ohio can't fact-check the future, so we won't rate the question of whether HB 194 will worsen provisional ballot problems. But we can look at the rules and at HB 194. Voting in the wrong precinct is the biggest reason, after change of address, for provisional ballots. Provisional ballots can be cast in the wrong precinct because poll workers accidentally send voters to the wrong table in a polling place with multiple precincts, or to the wrong polling place, which can follow an error such as a poll worker misreading a street guide. Reports from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission show that relatively few states reject significant numbers of provisional ballots because they were cast in the wrong precinct. Only New York and Arizona rejected more wrong precinct ballots than Ohio in 2008, according to the EAC, and those three states accounted for the majority of the nation's total. In 2010, no state left more provisional ballots uncounted than Ohio. Rejected wrong-precinct ballots represent registered voters whose ballots were thrown out because they went to the wrong table or location. Ohio had 14,227 of them in 2008, according to the EAC report. The number is slightly larger, 14,335, on the website of Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted. House Bill 3, the Ohio elections law enacted in 2006, expanded provisional voting and restricted the counting of provisional ballots. It required that a provisional ballot be cast in the correct jurisdiction to count, and specifically defined jurisdiction as precinct. Election boards previously could count the races for a voter's correct precinct on a misdirected ballot. HB 194 "permits, instead of requires, an election official to direct a voter who is in the wrong precinct to the voter's correct precinct," according to the Ohio Legislative Service Commission. It says that it is the duty of the individual voter to ensure that a ballot is cast in the correct precinct. We note that we’re not taking a position on whether it’s good policy to leave that duty with the individual voter. Suffice to say that Clyde’s position is that more should be done. The issue went to federal court recently because of a race for juvenile court judge in Hamilton County that has been unresolved since Election Night 2010 because of provisional ballots. The two candidates in that race were separated by 23 votes in the election board's tally, but 849 provisional ballots were not counted due to error. Hundreds of those votes should be counted, U.S. District Judge Susan Dlott ruled this month in a 93-page decision. In some cases, Dlott noted, voters showed up at the right polling place, but mistakenly voted at the wrong precinct table, an error known as "right church, wrong pew." Testimony showed that poll workers mistakenly directed some voters to the wrong table, and that some poll workers did not recognize the significance of voting at the correct precinct table. Currently under Ohio's precinct-based voting, Dlott wrote, votes cast in the wrong precinct are not to be "counted under any circumstance, even when the ballot is miscast due to poll worker error." She said that policy "is fundamentally unfair and abrogates the 14th Amendment’s guarantee of due process of law." The ruling reinforces Clyde’s assertion that wrong-precinct rules worsen the problems with provisional voting. Clyde said that "wrong precinct rules exacerbate our provisional ballot problems," a reference to the high rate of provisional voting in the state. Data from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission shows that wrong precinct voting is the No. 2 reason for provisional voting. In Ohio, votes cast in the wrong precinct are not counted. There were more than 14,000 such ballots in the 2008 election. We’re not rating whether HB 194 will worsen those problems. But that the legislation "permits, instead of requires, an election official to direct a voter who is in the wrong precinct to the voter's correct precinct," shows it’s not an attempt to aggressively address the issue. The duty remains on the individual voter to ensure that a ballot is cast in the correct precinct. On the Truth-O-Meter, Clyde's statement rates True.

pomt-07037	"Rick Scott has destroyed over 100,000 jobs."	false	/florida/statements/2011/jul/01/rod-smith/top-state-democrat-claims-job-losses-not-gains-tai/	Florida Democrats are countering Gov. Rick Scott's claims about creating jobs, by saying the first-term governor is in fact killing them. Since at least April, the Florida Democratic Party has repeated in news releases, in e-mail to supporters, on their website and with social media a particularly appealing fact: Scott has destroyed 100,000 jobs. Here's one example from a mass e-mail June 28, 2011, from the chairman of the Florida Democratic Party, Rod Smith: "Rick Scott has destroyed over 100,000 jobs, gutted the education budget, and remains completely out-of-touch with Floridians." We wondered, what's behind that 100,000? Back in April, Democrats launched a website, www.WhereIsMyFloridaJob.com, to "hold Rick Scott accountable." But when we tried to visit it in June, it showed a single sentence: "Site maintenance in progress." So we asked Eric Jotkoff, spokesman for the Florida Democrats, to explain how they are getting their numbers. He explained it was a "pretty conservative estimate" based on expected teacher layoffs, cuts to local police, firefighters and other public employees, cuts to Medicaid reimbursement rates, cuts to university spending, the planned privatization of South Florida prisons, the rejection of federal funding for high-speed rail, the shift of funding from a transportation trust fund expected to affect construction projects, a change in how water districts are funded, and Scott's refusal to meet with a biotech company (Jackson Labs) that ultimately didn't locate a new project in the state. Jotkoff also left the door open for other job-killers he wasn't thinking of just then. (At the time we asked, he also included possible death of SunRail — which a few days later the governor actually allowed to move forward.) To recap: budget cuts, prison privatization, high-speed rail, Jackson Labs. Rather than a spreadsheet, Democrats say they kept an informal tally that shifts as time passes. In April, the 100,000 was based on the governor's proposed budget. Now that the legislative session has passed, it's based on the state budget as signed by the governor, with a few other actions for good measure. In any case, it's always been close enough to round up to 100,000, Jotkoff said. (We did throw his estimates into a spreadsheet, and with SunRail they came close, to around 96,000 jobs. Several items had wiggle-room that could have pushed the number above 100,000.) But no matter what the estimates say on any given day, the Democrats' claim has several problems: • "Has destroyed" makes it sound like jobs are already gone — but the analysis is almost entirely based on jobs that are expected to be lost. • "Has destroyed" also makes it sound like Scott's policies have eliminated 100,000 jobs that already existed. But that's only the case for some of the jobs included in Jotkoff's tally, such as cuts leading to layoffs of state and local employees. Others, from high-speed rail to highway construction to biotech jobs, didn't yet exist — and may never have materialized. • In the same way it's troublesome for Scott to take credit for job creation, it's also problematic for Democrats to singularly blame Scott for job losses. The Legislature debated and passed the budgets that reduce funding for local districts, and signed off on a reduction to the state workforce. Ultimately, they share some responsibility for those jobs losses as well. There's one more significant problem with basing this claim on expected changes: Nobody knows how many jobs may actually be shed, much less the Democrats. In at least half the categories Jotkoff gave us, the estimates were "thousands" or "tens of thousands." In some cases (transportation trust fund, Medicaid spending) projections were based on estimates by industry and interest groups. In others (Jackson Labs) the promises of new jobs were so ethereal, local governments weren't even certain they would come to be — yet Jotkoff blamed Scott for the loss of the maximum number of jobs the company thought it might create over 20 years, about 3,000. Jotkoff told us he was pressed for time to make his case -- though we gave him several days to respond to our questions. Here at PolitiFact Florida, we dare to dream that if you routinely repeat a number for months, you've got the goods to prove it. It's entirely possible that when the dust settles, Scott — who advocates cutting government jobs to encourage job-creation in the private sector — will have hurt employment in the state by 100,000. But this evidence doesn't prove that. And that's not even what Democrats charged — they said he has already destroyed 100,000 jobs. Meanwhile, the best evidence we do have, survey estimates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, show the state has actually added 76,800 net jobs since January. We know that the budget passed by the Legislature and signed by Scott contains real pain for Florida families, in particular teachers and state workers. But Democrats should focus on claims they can prove, and this isn't one of them. We rate it False.	None	Rod Smith	None	None	None	2011-07-01T19:11:57	2011-06-28	['None']

pomt-05400	"The failed economic policies" of President Barack Obama, the Democrats and the Federal Reserve "are making gas prices higher while America’s economy is running on fumes."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/may/04/eric-hovde/eric-hovde-says-economic-policies-are-whats-making/	In late March 2012, gas prices in the Milwaukee area hit a record high, $4.20 a gallon, according to AAA Wisconsin. While prices have come down, to about $3.83 a gallon, that milestone ignited a new round in the political blame game. We’ve heard some of these claims many times -- there’s not enough oil drilling, we’re too dependent on foreign oil, Obama is standing in the way of the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada. (PolitiFact’s National site has an entire section devoted to the topic.) In Wisconsin, a radio ad from Republican U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde tapped into the frustration that many motorists feel when they fill their tanks. In the ad, Hovde says Obama and Congress are spending wildly, and "this causes the Federal Reserve to crank up the presses printing more and more money." "So the United States dollar is being devalued resulting in the prices for our basic necessities like food and oil to rise," Hovde says. "These failed economic policies are making gas prices higher while America’s economy is running on fumes." He elaborated in an April 24, 2012 appearance at the Milwaukee Press Club. "What printing money does is it debases the currency and devalues the dollar," Hovde said. "That is why oil prices are $100 a barrel, and why gas prices are over $4. … If we don’t stop the Fed from quantitative easing, you could be looking at, within a matter of years, I’m talking about six or eight or 10 dollars for a gallon of gas." Wow. Those are startling numbers. "You can track this," Hovde said when asked for backup to his claim. "It’s written extensively about. I’m not the only out there talking about this." For a deeper look at the first-time candidate’s claims, we dialed up some experts on oil and gasoline prices. John Felmy, chief economist, American Petroleum Institute, a key oil industry trade group: Felmy said gasoline prices very closely follow the price of oil. There’s been a record level of demand for oil worldwide and some supply constraints, in part because Libya is currently not exporting oil. "It’s a tight market, and there’s not a lot of excess capacity," Felmy said, adding that gasoline prices "are driven more by overall supply and demand." He said that there was no question that a devalued dollar affected the price of oil, but he said it was more of an indirect factor: "I go back to Econ 101 and the old supply and demand curves. I tend to believe it’s really the market fundamentals." To understand the cost of a price of a gallon of gas, divide the price of a barrel of crude oil by 42 gallons -- the amount that one barrel will produce. So, at $105 a barrel, that’s $2.50 a gallon. State and local taxes add, on average, 49 cents to that. Add in the cost to refine the oil into gas, storage, shipping and profits along the way, including for the gas stations, and you’re quite close to the pump price, API spokesman Bill Bush said. Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst, Oil Price Information Service, which follows prices for groups, including AAA: "Prices rose first because of higher crude prices -- U.S. domestic crude advanced to about $110 (a barrel) and overseas sweet crudes fetched a price as high as $130." The reasons behind the prices increases include "growing consumption in emerging economies; money that has been parked (whether through passive investment or active speculation) in crude oil purchases; and worries about Iranian supply and other MENA (Middle East, North African) country issues." Kloza said that a weaker dollar "exerts upward pressure on oil, since all oil transactions are priced in dollars." Pam Moen, spokeswoman for AAA Wisconsin: Many experts blamed rising tensions with Iran over that country’s nuclear program. "If this were to escalate, there could be some disruption caused by Iran in the world’s oil supply," she said. Prices in the Milwaukee market were also higher than the rest of the state because the area is required to used a most-expensive "reformulated" gasoline, she said. Also, supplies tend to tighten and prices go up in late winter as refineries switch from winter to summer fuel blends. Adolfo Laurenti, deputy chief economist for Mesirow Financial, a private financial services firm in Chicago, who frequently comments on the economy: There is "no correlation between Fed actions and the price of gasoline." It’s simple supply and demand, PolitiFact Georgia wrote in 2011. Geopolitical forces on the other side of the world are a major price driver, as is the state of the global economy. Energy technology plays a role too. "It’s really complex to explain to people how energy markets work. So in campaigns people are always looking for the bumper sticker," Jay Hakes, former director of the Energy Information Administration under President Bill Clinton and author of the book "A Declaration of Energy Independence" told PolitiFact Georgia. Hovde said others have written extensively about the same link he is making, between the budget and monetary policies and gas prices. He did not point us to anything in particular. We searched and didn’t find much evidence to substantiate this claim. One oft-cited piece was a May 16, 2011 commentary produced by the staff of the Joint Economic Committee Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives. "In much the same way that one can use the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to measure the cost of living, one can index the price of oil, an international commodity, to the value of the dollar (to) measure the impact of the dollar’s declining value on the price of oil." The paper concludes that if the value of the dollar remained unchanged since the Fed began using monetary policy in 2008, "the price of oil (Brent Crude) would be $17.04 per barrel less." The paper applies the same logic to gas prices, concluding that the price of a gallon of gas is 56.5 cents higher than if the dollar had not declined. The commentary, however, doesn’t take into account any of the factors cited by other experts that affect the price of oil -- rising Mideast tensions, greater demand from China, and so forth. The committee’s staff report, was cited in numerous blogs and opinion pieces, including one published by the San Francisco Examiner on May 17, 2011 by the committee’s vice chairman, Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas. Our rating Hovde claimed that actions by Obama, Congress and the Fed’s monetary policy had devalued dollar led to higher gas prices. The candidate uses a broad brush to describe the Federal Reserve’s actions in the wake of the financial market and housing meltdown. The value of the dollar factors into the equation, but as a secondary factor. We rate Hovde’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-01003	Ronald Reagan "banned ownership of fully automatic rifles. He supported the assault weaspons ban."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2015/feb/04/alfonso-lopez/lopez-says-reagan-supported-assault-weapon-bans/	Del. Alfonso Lopez recently conjured the spirit of Ronald Reagan in an ill-fated attempt to convince the Republican-led House of Delegates to pass gun control legislation. "In Virginia, we have a bad habit of defeating every single sensible gun violence prevention bill proposal," Lopez, D-Arlington, lamented in a Jan. 19 floor speech. "By the standards of today, Ronald Reagan was a traitor to the Second Amendment," Lopez said. The delegate added about Reagan, "As president, he banned ownership of fully automatic rifles. He supported the assault weapons ban..." We wondered whether Lopez described the Gipper’s record correctly. We asked the delegate for proof of his claim and he sent an assortment of newspaper articles, two op-ed pieces Reagan wrote after his presidency, and a 2013 Truth-O-Meter by PolitiFact Georgia on a similar claim about Reagan. Let’s start by recalling that Reagan was shot in the chest in a 1981 assassination attempt that left his press secretary, James Brady, with a gunshot wound to the head and permanent brain damage. During the rest of his administration, which ended in 1989, Reagan "often expressed opposition to national gun control laws," according to a 1994 article in The New York Times. Shortly after his shooting, he said he was "a little disturbed" that people were "focusing on gun control as an answer to the crime problem today." Lopez pointed out to us that in 1986, Reagan signed the Firearm Owners Protection Act. The bill provided a number of protections for gun owners. But it also barred the private sale and ownership of any fully automatic rifles -- machine guns -- that were not already registered with the federal government on the day Reagan signed the law. The provision, still in effect today, is not the outright ban that Lopez described. Private citizens remain free to buy and transfer machine guns that were registered prior to May 20, 1986 -- provided they pass a background check, receive signed approval from their local police chief or sheriff and pay a $200 federal tax. There are 512,790 registered machine guns in the United States, according to a 2014 report by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Virginia was home to 31,825 of them, more than any state. Now, let’s move to the assertion that Reagan also backed a ban on assault weapons, which are often described as semi-automatic firearms with detachable magazines and pistol grips. They are capable of firing many rounds without reloading, but the trigger has to be pulled for each shot. Lopez referred us to a May 1994 letter signed by Reagan and former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter urging members of the U.S. House of Representatives to to support a pending bill banning assault weapons. They wrote, "While we recognize that assault weapon legislation will not stop all assault weapon crime, statistics prove that we can dry up the supply of these guns, making them less accessible to criminals. We urge you to listen to the American public and to the law enforcement community and support a ban on the further manufacture of these weapons." Reagan also sent a personal note that month to one of the fence sitters on ban: Rep. Scott Klug, R-WI. "I know there is heavy pressure on you to go the other way, but I strongly urge you to join me in supporting this bill," he wrote. It must be passed." The measure cleared Congress, with Klug’s support, and was signed by then-President. Bill Clinton. The assault weapons ban expired in 2004 when Congress refused to extend it. We should note that since Lopez’s speech, the General Assembly has killed a number of gun control bills, including legislation by Lopez that would have restricted the sale and ownership of high-capacity firearm magazines. Our ruling Lopez said, "As president, (Reagan) banned ownership of fully automatic rifles. He supported the assault weapons ban." Lopez errs in saying Reagan banned ownership of machine guns. Reagan, in 1986, signed a law that barred the private sale and ownership of machine guns that were not already registered on the day he signed the bill. The measure stopped new machine guns from entering the private marketplace, it did not ban the old ones. Lopez is correct on the second part of his claim. In 1994, after his presidency, Reagan signed a letter urging the House to pass an assault weapons ban. On the whole, we rate Lopez’s statement as Half True.

pomt-03996	Says Texas is "last in mental health expenditures."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/feb/08/sacramento-bee-editorial-board/sacramento-bee-editorial-says-texas-last-mental-he/	Disparaging Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s pitch for California businesses to check out opportunities in his state, the Sacramento Bee editorial board said Texas ranks poorly in several ways. We’ve been sorting through the Feb. 6, 2013, editorial’s factual claims. Click here to read our collected checks. Among the claims: "Come check out a state that is last in mental health expenditures..." That’s familiar. We recently looked into the same characterization by state Sen. Wendy Davis, rating it Mostly True. Another state lagged Texas in the latest national ranking of states. Stuart Leavenworth, who edits the Bee’s editorial page, pointed us to the same source that Davis cited, a Dec. 18, 2012, news story posted by WFAA-TV, Channel 8 in Dallas, that was headlined "Texas ranks last in mental health funding." That story said Texas ranked last in the country in per-person mental health spending based on dollar amounts it attributed to the liberal, Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities. When we inquired, a center official told us they gave WFAA information about spending in fiscal 2009 as written up in an August 2012 report by the Texas-based Hogg Foundation for Mental Health. The Hogg Foundation, in turn, said its source was a listing of per-person mental health care spending data in 50 states by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. Texas was last among the states in such per-capita spending in 2009, 2008 and 2007, according to Kaiser foundation charts for those years, though the 2007 chart shows no available data for Hawaii. The latest comparison: In fiscal 2010, which in Texas ran through August 2010, Texas spent nearly $980 million total on mental health services, placing ninth nationally, according to a foundation chart. Its per-person spending of $38.99 placed the state 49th -- not last -- among the states. Idaho, with per-capita spending of $36.64, was 50th, with Maine No. 1 at per-capita spending of $346.92. The national average was $120.56. California was 14th among the states, at $152.60 in such spending per person. Our ruling The editorial says Texas is last in mental health spending. In 2010, the latest year analyzed, Texas spent more in raw dollars on mental health services than 41 states. But in per-resident spending -- the better metric for comparing states --Texas ranked second-to-last to Idaho after ranking last to all other states for several years. We rate this claim as Mostly True.	None	Sacramento Bee Editorial Board	None	None	None	2013-02-08T17:40:43	2013-02-06	['None']

pomt-09143	Georgia has "a dropout rate that’s higher" than Alabama's.	true	/georgia/statements/2010/jun/14/john-oxendine/oxendine-says-georgia-has-higher-dropout-rate-alab/	When gubernatorial candidate John Oxendine sought to demonstrate that Georgia's schools need help in a Web site campaign video, he made a striking claim. He said Georgia's students were doing worse than Alabama's. "As a parent of four children, three of them in school, I’m very concerned about our schools," he said. "We have SAT school scores lower than that of Alabama, yet a dropout rate that’s higher. We need to make some serious changes in how we address education.” Georgians think they should beat Alabama any day. In everything. Graduation rates, SAT scores. (Not that we do. Consider, for instance, the Bulldogs' football record against the Crimson Tide.) For the sake of state pride, we will verify Oxendine's claims. An earlier PolitiFact Georgia item rated Oxendine's statement on SAT scores as Half True. This item deals with his statement about dropouts. Calculating dropout rates is tricky. This measure tends to undercount students who don't finish school, said Chris Swanson, vice president for research and development with Editorial Projects in Education, the nonprofit group that publishes the education news and policy magazine Education Week. Instead, experts tend to rely on another measure: the graduation rate. This is the percentage of students who receive their diplomas on time. Graduation rates are more widely available and consistent, he said. Making a fair comparison between states is even more difficult. Few groups publish graduation rates that are comparable between states. Swanson's group does. So does the National Center for Education Statistics, which collects and publishes data for the U.S. Department of Education. Oxendine's statement avoids both of these pitfalls. Although he used the word "dropout," Oxendine's claim is actually based upon graduation rates, according to his campaign manager. His data come from the National Center for Education Statistics. For the past 13 years, average secondary-school graduation rates have been lower in Georgia than Alabama. In the 2006-2007 school year, the most recent time period available, Georgia graduated 64.1 percent. Alabama graduated 67.1. Figures from Editorial Projects in Education also show that Georgia lags behind Alabama. Its 2009 report states that the rate of Georgia students finishing high school with a regular diploma is 55.9 percent. Alabama's is at 61.4 percent. Indeed, Alabama beats Georgia. We rate Oxendine's statement as True.	None	John Oxendine	None	None	None	2010-06-14T06:00:00	2010-06-04	['Alabama']
pomt-06250	In Pennsylvania, President Barack Obama’s policies have increased unemployment 19 percent, led to the loss of 37,900 manufacturing jobs, and left 189,000 more people in poverty.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/30/republican-national-committee-republican/republican-national-committee-web-video-attacks-ba/	As President Barack Obama headed to Scranton, Pa., to push for an extension of a payroll tax break on Nov. 30, 2011, the Republican National Committee released a 30-second Web video criticizing him for the economy’s performance on his watch. The ad aired audio clips of a candidate Obama visit to Scranton on March 31, 2008, when he was engaged in a tight primary battle with Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. As the ad shows images of shuttered factories, Obama talks about the nation’s economic difficulties. Several phrases appear on the screen: "In 2008 … he promised Pennsylvanians hope & change … Today: Unemployment up 19% … 37,900 Pennsylvania manufacturing jobs lost … 189,000 more Pennsylvanians in poverty … Failed promises. Change direction." We’ll take the easy ones first, then take up the complicated one. Unemployment in Pennsylvania is up 19 percent. Making comparisons like these can be a bit confusing, because it’s easy to mix up percentage points and percents. But the number is accurate. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Pennsylvania’s unemployment rate in January 2009 was 6.8 percent, while its rate in October 2011 was 8.1 percent. That’s an increase of 1.3 percentage points, but that can also be expressed as an increase of 19 percent above the initial level. We should point out that Pennsylvania unemployment is actually down by seven-tenths of a point from its peak of 8.8 percent between January 2010 to April 2010. Expressed the way the ad did it, that means unemployment has fallen by 8 percent since its peak. But we have no quibble with the RNC’s methodology. There are 189,000 more Pennsylvanians in poverty. According to the Census Bureau, the number of Pennsylvanians in poverty rose from 1,335,000 in 2008 (the final year before Obama took office) to 1,521,000 in 2010 (the last year for which data is available). That’s a difference of 186,000 -- close enough in our book to the 189,000 cited in the ad. 37,900 Pennsylvania manufacturing jobs were lost. According to state employment statistics compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number is correct. Between January 2009, when Obama took office, and October 2011, the most recent month for which state figures are available, Pennsylvania did indeed lose 37,900 manufacturing jobs. But that isn’t the end of the story. For starters, it’s PolitiFact’s policy not to focus solely on the accuracy of the numbers in political attacks (or, conversely, efforts to claim political credit) but also to determine whether blame or credit for the results is justified. (This policy applies to all three statistics in this ad.) For job-creation and job-loss claims, we have ruled that politicians’ policies are just one factor in employment levels, making even statistically accurate claims something less than True on our Truth-O-Meter. However, the suggestion that manufacturing jobs have declined due to Obama’s policies is even more questionable than most job-related claims we’ve reviewed. As we have noted earlier, the nation’s manufacturing activity has fallen off a cliff over the past 50 years. This stems from countless reasons, ranging from the expansion of free trade to educational attainment patterns to the emergence of new sectors such as information technology. In January 1960, manufacturing jobs accounted for 29 percent of U.S. employment. By March 2011, that had fallen by about two-thirds, to just 9 percent. And in Pennsylvania, the number of manufacturing jobs has fallen by 40 percent since January 1990, the oldest data available for the state on the BLS Website. Based on this context, we think it’s a stretch to blame Obama for the decline in manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania since January 2009. But the claim is even more problematic if you look at how manufacturing in Pennsylvania fared under Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush. Between the time Bush took office in January 2001 and the time he left in January 2009, the number of Pennsylvania manufacturing jobs fell by 244,900. Dividing by Bush’s eight years in the White House, that works out to an annual decline of 30,613 manufacturing jobs. Yet taking the decline under Obama and dividing that by 2.83 years in office works out to 13,376 manufacturing jobs lost per year -- or less than half the rate of decline under Bush. In other words, during the worst economic conditions since the Great Depression, Pennsylvania manufacturing job losses declined less than half as quickly under Obama as under Bush. This clashes with the overall message of the ad, which is that Obama economic policies have failed Pennsylvania, and -- judging by the ad’s imagery -- its manufacturing sector in particular. This may not offer much solace for the Obama camp -- it’s hard to crow, "The Pennsylvania manufacturing sector eroded more slowly on our watch than it did under our predecessor!" -- but we do think it’s important context to point out. Our rating The ad gets all of its numbers right, but it overreaches by holding Obama fully accountable for these trends. In particular, the RNC’s manufacturing jobs statistic ignores both a decades-long national and state decline in manufacturing jobs and the fact that the rate of manufacturing job losses in Pennsylvania during Obama’s presidency was slower than the rate of job losses under his predecessor, George W. Bush. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.	None	Republican National Committee	None	None	None	2011-11-30T16:24:23	2011-11-30	['Pennsylvania', 'Barack_Obama']

First, a 1998 tape of Obama surfaced in which he said, in part, "I actually believe in redistribution, at least at a certain level to make sure that everybody's got a shot." Then, Romney brought up the topic during a Sept. 19, 2012, appearance in Atlanta. Romney said that Obama "really believes in what I’ll call a government-centered society," according to an account in POLITICO. "I know there are some who believe that if you simply take from some and give to others then we’ll all be better off. It’s known as redistribution. It’s never been a characteristic of America. There’s a tape that came out just a couple of days ago where the president said yes he believes in redistribution. I don’t. I believe the way to lift people and help people have higher incomes is not to take from some and give to others but to create wealth for all." Romney continued, "This idea of redistribution follows from the idea that if you have a business you didn’t build it, someone else did that. It’s the same concept. … The government is responsible for everything that’s gone on here. And therefore government can take and give as it chooses. It’s an entirely foreign concept that will not work, that has not worked. That has never worked anywhere in the world. And what we have to do in America is not to make us more like Europe, but to make America more like America...." We wondered whether Romney was correct to say that "redistribution" has "never been a characteristic of America." So we checked with historians and economists. Most agreed that Romney was ignoring the fundamental structure of the nation's progressive tax system, which has been redistributing wealth for a century, as well as a host of other policies, some of which predate the nation’s founding. A progressive tax system is one that takes a larger share of the income of high-income earners than it does from low-income individuals. Since this revenue is spent on government programs -- which benefit people other than just the taxpayer whose income is taken -- a progressive tax system is essentially by definition redistributive. Indeed, the U.S. system, at least if you look at the official rates, has been far more redistributive in the past than it is now, with a top federal income tax rate of 35 percent. Just looking at some previous Republican presidents, the top tax rate was over 50 percent under Warren Harding, over 60 percent under Herbert Hoover, over 90 percent for Dwight Eisenhower’s entire term, 70 percent or higher for Nixon’s entire term, and 70 percent under Gerald Ford, said said Daniel N. Shaviro, professor of taxation at New York University Law School. (Shaviro has written in his blog that he supports Obama over Romney.) And once this money comes into the federal treasury, it’s quickly redistributed. As we have noted previously, some states send more money to the federal treasury than they get back, while some states receive more money than they put in. The Tax Foundation, a business-backed group, crunched the numbers back in 2007 and reported that New Mexico got $2.03 for every dollar it sent to Washington, while New Jersey got just 61 cents. The approach of redistribution dates back to colonial times, when the colonies levied property taxes on landholders. Since not everyone owned land, but because everyone benefited from at least some of the fruits of that revenue, such taxes were inherently redistributional. Not to suggest that Americans were always happy about this. "Settlers far from markets complained that taxing land on a per-acre basis was unfair and demanded that property taxation be based on value," wrote Glenn W. Fisher, an emeritus public administration professor at Wichita State University. Indeed, early efforts to expand infrastructure such as roads and canals -- championed in the 1820s by Sen. Henry Clay -- stumbled over disputes over using general taxpayer money to fund projects with local benefits. Later, subsidies for building transcontinental railroads began in the 1860s but eventually devolved into major corruption scandals. Such funding was, in effect, a redistribution from the public to big business. In the second half of the 19th century and the first part of the 20th century, the government added one redistributive program after another -- Civil War benefits and a veterans’ health system took money from the young and gave it to the old; public education and land-grant colleges took money from the old and gave it to the young. Social Security redistributed money from workers to retirees, while agricultural subsidies redistributed funds from non-farmers to farmers. "You could argue that a true welfare state didn’t take shape until the New Deal, but even that was 80 years ago, so it doesn’t support the claim that redistribution has ‘never’ been characteristic of America," said Rutgers University historian David Greenberg. "The notion that redistribution is some recent, Obama-led fanaticism, as opposed to a normal, reasonable, widely accepted way of running a large, complex nation, is just silly." Peter Lindert, an economist at the University of California at Davis, says redistribution is an essential function of any government. "At the most profound level, any choice about how to run a country redistributes well-being from some to others," he said. Several experts we interviewed cautioned that while Romney’s claim is factually incorrect, it’s important not to overlook his larger point -- that too much redistribution can be a bad thing. Douglas J. Besharov, a University of Maryland public policy professor, said that because America has generated so much upward mobility over the years, redistributing too much will "kill the goose that lays the golden egg." And Dan Mitchell, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute, said that "we have income-based redistribution in our means-tested programs and, to a lesser extent, age-based redistribution in our social insurance programs, but we're not Europe." Mitchell added, however, that "we are heading that direction, which Romney, in his typically inarticulate fashion, was trying to explain." Still, on Romney’s specific claim that "redistribution" has "never been a characteristic of America," experts agreed that he ignores longstanding fundamentals of our system of taxing and spending. "Not to sound intemperate here, but the claim is completely ridiculous and false," said Shaviro, the NYU tax professor. "This goes way beyond hyperbole. Romney is trying to rewrite and falsify U.S. history." Our ruling Romney said that "redistribution" has "never been a characteristic of America." Reasonable people can disagree about the wisdom of it, but redistribution has been a basic principle of the U.S. tax system and many federal programs, including some such as veterans benefits that have long attracted support from Republicans.

pomt-08287	"In fact, 85 percent of Oregonians voted in 2008."	false	/oregon/statements/2010/nov/05/democratic-party-oregon/eighty-five-percent-oregonians-voted-2008/	This time of year, voting is right up there with picking up litter and adopting kittens as far as civic duties go. In fact, PolitiFact Oregon found this get-out-the-vote reminder distributed to homes on Tuesday, courtesy of the Democratic Party of Oregon. "VOTE," read the flier. "Your community knows exactly how important it is to vote. In fact, 85 percent of Oregonians voted in 2008. Thank you for your participation this year." At first, PolitiFact Oregon was elated. Who knew Oregon took its ballot duty that seriously? But then, we became suspicious. Isn’t 25 percent of the population here under 18? How could it be then that 85 percent of Oregonians voted in 2008? So, onward to the fact checking. First the numbers. There were more than 3.7 million people in Oregon as of July 2007. Obviously, the DPO didn’t mean to claim that babies cast ballots, so let’s whittle the number down to just eligible voters -- 2.8 million is what the secretary of state’s office estimated. Precisely 1,845,251 people cast ballots in the fall 2008 election. Multiply 2.8 million by 85 percent (0.85) and you get nearly 2.4 million people -- which is way more than the 1.8 million who actually voted. So what gives? Well, it turns out that 85 percent of registered voters cast ballots in the 2008 presidential election. Not everyone who is eligible to vote actually registered to vote. In fact, according to the Secretary of State’s website, only 77 percent of eligible adults registered and of that figure, 85 percent cast ballots. Which brings the overall figure to 66 percent. That’s pretty good -- but not 85 percent good. To be fair, Oregon has long used this calculation to measure electoral participation of registered voters, which Oregon elections officials refer to as "turnout," but no one with a straight face extrapolates that to say that means "85 percent of Oregonians voted." Also, not everyone measures turnout the same way. The United States Elections Project, for example, run by an associate professor atGeorge Mason University, uses as its base eligible voters to measure turnout, not registered voters. According to the elections project, 68.1 percent of eligible Oregonians voted in 2008. That’s on the high end, and it’s higher than the 62.2 percent cited nationally. Minnesota, apparently, can claim the title of most vote-happy state, with turnout at 78 percent two years ago; on the other hand, Hawaii, at 50.8 percent, just wasn’t into it. Oregon did have a fairly high voter participation rate in 2008. If the flier had said that Oregon’s turnout in 2008 was 85 percent, or that 85 percent of voters cast a ballot that year, we wouldn’t have a problem with the claim. But to say that 85 percent of Oregonians voted in 2008 is just plain inaccurate. We rate the claim False. Comment on this item.

pomt-10552	John McCain "said publicly that Hillary Clinton would make a good president."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/14/james-dobson/mccain-knew-it-would-get-him-in-trouble/	James Dobson, an evangelical leader who founded the conservative Christian group Focus on the Family, says he cannot support Sen. John McCain. He has gone so far as to say he will not vote for the first time in his life this November if McCain is the Republican nominee. In a statement read by Laura Ingraham on her radio show, Dobson attacked McCain's conservative credentials, specifically his collegiality with Democrats. Dobson emphasized that the statement was his personal opinion, not that of Focus on the Family. "I am convinced Sen. McCain is not a conservative, and in fact, has gone out of his way to stick his thumb in the eyes of those who are," the statement reads. "He has at times sounded more like a member of the other party. McCain actually considered leaving the GOP in 2001, and approached John Kerry about being Kerry's running mate in 2004. McCain also said publicly that Hillary Clinton would make a good president. Given these and many other concerns, a spoonful of sugar does not make the medicine go down. I cannot, and I will not vote for Sen. John McCain, as a matter of conscience." We've addressed a claim on McCain being considered as a running mate to John Kerry here. So we'll focus on Dobson's claim that McCain once said Sen. Clinton would make a good president. According to a transcript of Meet the Press, Dobson is right. Wrapping up a Feb. 20, 2005, appearance from Baghdad during a joint trip, the senators praised each other in a light-hearted exchange. McCain even ended the interview by acknowledging what trouble he'd gotten into. Russert: "Senator McCain, a serious question: Do you think the lady to your right would make a good president?" Clinton: "Oh, we can't hear you, Tim. We can't hear you." McCain: "Yeah, you're breaking up. I am sure that Senator Clinton would make a good president. I happen to be a Republican and would support, obviously, a Republican nominee, but I have no doubt that Senator Clinton would make a good president." Russert: "Equal time, Senator Clinton. The gentleman to your left?" Clinton: "Absolutely." Russert: "We may have a fusion ticket right here." McCain: "Thanks for doing that to us. Thanks for doing that to us, Tim." No spin in that exchange. We judge Dobson's statement to be True.	None	James Dobson	None	None	None	2008-02-14T00:00:00	2008-02-05	['John_McCain', 'Hillary_Rodham_Clinton']

pomt-13645	"Mike Pence voted against expanding the Children’s Health Insurance program, which Hillary helped to start."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/08/howard-dean/howard-dean-largely-right-mike-pences-health-polic/	Speakers at the Democratic National Convention made clear their disdain for GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean did just that but also managed to attack Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, on his health policy record. In the speech, Dean said that Trump would "rip up Obamacare." He continued by saying, "His vice presidential pick is no better. Mike Pence voted against expanding the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which Hillary helped to start," among other claims about Pence's health care policy positions. We decided to look into Dean's statement about Pence and the Children's Health Insurance Program, called CHIP. Is Dean's statement accurate? Pence on the Children’s Health Insurance Program The Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, was first created by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 under Bill Clinton’s administration. According to Medicaid, it has insured over 8 million low-income children who could not afford private coverage. The Hillary Clinton campaign has touted her role in passing the legislation. While she did play a significant part from the White House, others were pivotal in moving it through the Republican-controlled Congress, notably the late Sen. Ted Kennedy. We've rated the statement that she helped get the program "done" as Mostly True. So, did Pence vote against the legislation? Pence served in Congress from 2001 to 2012. During that time, there were four major roll call votes directly affecting CHIP. Children’s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007: The bill sought to extend the program and increase its funding. Pence voted no. After being passed in both chambers, it was vetoed by President Bush. In the vote to override the veto, Pence voted no again. Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009: During the Obama administration, the bill was passed. The legislation marked significant expansion of the program’s funding, including new programming and incentives for states to increase enrollment. Pence voted no. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010: The health-related parts of these two bills combine to form what is commonly known as the Affordable Care Act. The bills extended CHIP funding for another two years. Pence voted no on both. Although Pence did not vote in favor of the reauthorization proposals in 2007 or 2009, he did offer statements on the legislation. In an editorial for the Star Press in Indiana, Pence wrote that while he supports expanding health insurance for poor children, the Democratic legislation "represented a massive expansion of this anti-poverty program into the middle class." Instead of the CHIP reauthorizations, Pence had supported other bills like the More Children, More Choices Act of 2007, which expand coverage but use tax credits. Dean’s assertion that Pence voted against CHIP is accurate, though Pence did support Republican legislation to get health care to low-income children. Pence in Indiana We should note that Pence's health care record isn't entirely against the Democratic policy agenda. While Dean attacked Pence’s congressional record, Pence’s most notable healthcare-related policies have come during his time as governor of Indiana. The state is known for the Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP), which many have called a compromise between Obamacare and conservative health policy ideas. HIP expanded the state’s Medicaid coverage by using federal dollars, which is now optional for states since a 2012 Supreme Court ruling. While adopting provisions of the Affordable Care Act, Indiana expanded Medicaid through a waiver plan, allowing the state to add additional stipulations and restrictions. Particularly contentious is HIP’s premium contribution requirement, which forces Medicaid recipients to pay a small premium each month. If people fail to pay, they are locked out of benefits for six months. Sherry Glied, professor of public service at New York University with an extensive background in health policy, notes that the benefits of Indiana’s Medicaid expansion "include the same essential benefits required under Obamacare for all individual market and Medicaid plans, among them mental health and substance use benefits." So, although Dean is largely correct about Pence’s voting record on CHIP in Congress, Pence’s policies as governor have added other benefits at the state level. Our ruling Dean criticized Pence’s health policy record, saying, "Mike Pence voted against expanding the Children’s Health Insurance program,which Hillary helped to start." That claim is largely accurate. Pence voted against CHIP when he was in Congress, and Clinton did have a role in starting the program when she was First Lady. But it is important to note that Pence has supported health policy as governor of Indiana that was in line with health policies that Dean and other Democrats support. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Howard Dean	None	None	None	2016-08-08T10:51:14	2016-07-26	['Hillary_Rodham_Clinton', 'Mike_Pence']
pomt-09777	The Obama administration is "cutting back on defense"	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/25/sean-hannity/hannity-says-obama-cutting-back-defense/	During an interview with Sen. John McCain, Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity closed by asking the former Republican presidential candidate whether President Barack Obama was getting soft on defense. "Do you think the president is adopting a pre-9/11 mentality?" Hannity asked McCain. "I know those are pretty strong words, but I believe he is. I believe he is weakening our national reaction. I think if you look at Gitmo, Mirandizing enemy combatants, cutting back on defense, you know, slowing down our nuclear. It seems to me it's beyond the pre-9/11 mentality." For this item we'll focus on just one of Hannity's assertions: that Obama is "cutting back on defense." After speaking to several defense budget experts, we've found a clear consensus on that question: maybe. Hannity did not include a time frame or provide qualifiers, so we need to look at his claim by examining some different ways to measure defense spending: -- The base budget vs. the war budget . Anyone looking at the defense budget must consider two main numbers. One is the base budget, which includes most everything outside of direct war spending. The second is war spending. To compare apples to apples, our sources advised us to stick to the base budget. That avoids lots of budgetary volatility, since war spending can quickly spike or decline depending on the needs on the front lines. The base budget, by contrast, is a more stable indicator of Obama's priorities. Comparing Obama's fiscal year 2010 base budget request for defense to the 2009 fiscal year (which was funded under President Bush) shows an increase from $513.4 billion to $533.8 billion — a jump of 3.9 percent. That's certainly not a cut, and if the budget for 2010 were the only measurement considered, Hannity would be flat-out wrong to say the budget is decreasing. (We should point out that the fiscal year 2010 number includes a one-time shift into the base budget of some items that had been categorized under the war budget during the administration of President George W. Bush. This shift effectively increases the base budget by about $13 billion without affecting how much money is spent on those items. However, even subtracting the newly shifted amount from the fiscal year 2010 increase, the base budget still increased from one year to year the next, so it would not be correct to call that year's change a cut.) And President Obama has proposed that the base budget will continue to rise in absolute dollars through 2014, though by smaller percentages. For fiscal year 2011, it rises by 1.5 percent; for fiscal year 2012, it rises by 1.6 percent; for 2013, it rises by 1.9 percent; and for 2014, it rises by 2.4 percent. Again, using this factor, Hannity would be wrong to say that Obama is cutting defense. -- But what about inflation ? Is it possible for an increase in spending to actually be a cut? In the topsy-turvy world of Washington wonkery, it's possible — if inflation rises more quickly than spending. In the case of the 2009 to 2010 comparison we cited above, experts say inflation is currently so low that it's unlikely to make much of a dent in that increase. Generally, though, inflation plays a significant role. Michael O'Hanlon of the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution wrote in a June 10, 2009, op-ed that under Obama, the average increase in the base defense budget between 2010 and 2014 would be about 2 percent a year, which in his view translates into "no real growth" because that increase would be largely eaten up by inflation. "The administration is hardly slashing funds for defense; it is simply adopting a policy of zero real growth in the base budget," he wrote. "With the inflation rate expected to average over 1.5 percent, the net effect is essentially no real growth. Cumulatively, that would leave us about $150 billion short of actual funding requirements through 2014." Making the problem worse is that inflation for defense costs is traditionally higher than inflation for the economy as a whole. "The cost of almost everything we've been doing in defense has been accelerating upward too fast even for growing budgets to keep up," said Stephen Daggett, a defense specialist with the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, in congressional testimony he gave in February 2009. Daggett and O'Hanlon agree that such increases have been driven by personnel costs, including health care and benefits; operations and maintenance; purchases of increasingly complex equipment; and efforts to reorient the military branches to new threats. In other words, just to keep pace, defense spending should really run a couple percentage points higher than general inflation — and under the Obama blueprint, it probably would not do that. (By contrast, during the Bush years of 2001 to 2009, the base defense budget grew at an average real rate of 4.6 percent annually, according to Todd Harrison of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments .) If you factor inflation into the equation, then, Obama is effectively decreeing a slowing of the rate of growth. Hannity could certainly make a case that this amounts to a cut even though Obama is still increasing spending on a year-to-year basis. -- How big is the defense budget compared to gross domestic product ? Another measure of defense spending is to compare it to the United States' gross domestic product. According to Mackenzie Eaglen of the conservative Heritage Foundation, the Obama defense budget drops from 3.81 percent of GDP in 2010 to 3.01 percent in 2019. These calculations are always iffy because it's hard to predict GDP a full 10 years out — and the decrease could result from an expansion in the economy rather than a fall in defense spending. But if this measure were used, Hannity could argue with some legitimacy that this amounts to a defense cut. -- Do cuts of particular programs count ? Setting aside what's happening with the defense budget as a whole, the administration is clearly making specific cuts in programs. The administration has said it would cut such programs as the F-22 fighter, the DDG-1000 destroyer, parts of the Army's Future Combat System, the presidential helicopter fleet, aircraft carrier production runs, the airborne laser missile defense program and the next-generation bomber. These certainly qualify as "cuts" by the strictest definition of the word, but a more appropriate description might be that they represent a reshuffling of priorities. "These are specific cuts, but they are balanced by increases in other areas," said Harrison of CSBA. "The cuts to specific programs get a lot of attention, but the additions to others don't." In our view, the cutting of specific weapons programs doesn't count as "cutting back on defense" as long as the defense budget is increasing as a whole. So if Hannity was using specific program cuts as his yardstick, his assertion about Obama's defense budget would be unfair. Now it's time to recap. By some measurements, including defense spending as a percentage of GDP, Hannity is right that Obama is "cutting" defense. But from 2009 to 2010, the Obama administration is increasing the defense budget, and for a few years after that, he's increasing it in absolute terms (albeit at a slower rate than expected inflation). So whether Hannity is accurate depends on what measurement you use. We're rating his assertion Half True.	None	Sean Hannity	None	None	None	2009-09-25T13:12:44	2009-09-22	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-04376	Says an arts tax would provide "funding for certified arts and music teachers for every elementary school serving Portland residents."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2012/oct/19/creative-advocacy-network/would-portland-arts-tax-put-art-or-music-teacher-e/	The proposed Portland tax for the arts is nothing if not divisive. Supporters say the tax will mean having arts educators in every city elementary school, as well as better access to the arts throughout Portland. Detractors have called the tax poorly structured and say it uses children as a front for a plan to move money into already well-established institutions. The $35-a-person tax, which would collect some $12 million, actually goes to two different areas. About 70 percent of the money would be distributed to Portland-area school districts to help hire art and music teachers and to K-12 arts programs. The remaining funds would go to the Regional Arts and Culture Council for distribution among Portland arts organizations, such as the Oregon Symphony and the Portland Art Museum, which would use the money to offer publicly accessible art programming. To be sure, the money for schools seems to be the political campaign's primary selling point. On its website, the pro-tax Schools and Arts Together says the tax would "restore arts and music education in Portland's six school districts by providing stable, long-term funding for certified arts and music teachers for every elementary school serving Portland residents." And Jessica Jarrat Miller, executive director of the Creative Advocacy Network, which proposed the tax, asserted something similar during a September radio interview: "If we pass this measure, we will be able to fund teachers to make sure that every elementary school in our city has certified art instruction." And yet, a recent article in Willamette Week partly challenged that assertion. The weekly quoted former Emily Nazarov, the Portland organizer of Stand for Children, as saying the organization had "some serious concerns whether the measure will deliver on its promise of music and art teachers in every school." PolitiFact Oregon decided to check. Under the measure and an associated inter-governmental agreement, each district would get funding for one art or music teacher for every 500 elementary students. In return, the district agrees to have one full-time art or music teacher in each elementary school. That works fine for the David Douglas School District. Dan McCue, the spokesman for the district, told us that David Douglas has nine eligible elementary schools -- and would get enough money for nine art or music teachers. As it stands now, each of the elementary schools already has a full-time music teacher, so the art tax money "would be used to preserve those positions." But the formula falls apart if a district has some schools that are smaller than 500 students. Consider Portland Public Schools, the largest of the Portland districts. The district has 58 elementary schools -- but according to the 500-student formula, would receive funding for only 44 or 45 full-time positions. That means, should the tax pass, the district would have to find the money for the additional 13 or 14 teachers. We spoke with David Wynde, the district's deputy chief financial officer, to see if we understood the situation correctly. He confirmed we did. That would still represent some relief for the budget, he said. This year, PPS is funding 32 full-time arts or music positions. We called Jarrat Miller to see if she could explain how the tax would restore "arts for every Portland elementary school," as one mailer put it, if some districts were actually pitching in supplemental cash? "It's been widely misrepresented and confused," Jarrat Miller said. For Portland Public, she said, it's true that the tax would only provide 44 or 45 full-time teaching positions. It's equally true that, at least for the first year, PPS has agreed to pay for 13 additional full-time art or music teachers to make sure that every school has at least one. However, she said, the inter-governmental agreement – though not finalized – has been revised to say that if the district faces a financial hardship, the city of Portland would figure out a way to avoid cutting off the money. The bottom line, Jarrat Miller said, is that "nobody is forcing the district to do anything they can't do." In the event that Portland Public Schools had no money to commit to art instruction, the 45 teachers would still be more than the district is currently providing, she said. Those teachers would likely split their time among all 58 elementary schools. While 58 teachers is better, 45 would be enough to give all students art or music education once a week. The 500-to-one ratio, for what it's worth, was selected based on national student-teacher-ratio averages. "It's not a whole body that matters; it's how much education the kids are getting... that's what the ballot measure insists on," Jarrat Miller said. Wynde, the Portland Public financial officer, said he believed the additional language provided the district with the flexibility to renegotiate if funding becomes unstable. Nazarov, the local organizer for Stand for Children, seemed slightly less convinced. She said the organization was pleased that the inter-governmental agreement had been amended but thought the languageshould be more explicit in protecting the money. School and Arts Together has said that the arts tax would provide "funding for certified arts and music teachers for every elementary school serving Portland residents." It does accomplish this goal; however there are some important details that are missing –perhaps most glaringly, this idea that some districts would have to kick in money to ensure that each school has a full-time art or music teacher. Now, it's true that, in the case of financial hardship, this part of the measure could be renegotiated. But it's not clear what defines financial hardship or how those negotiations would take place -- and the inter-governmental agreement is still being drafted. Even if we assume that the funding would continue, it wouldn't be a full-time teacher in each school. We agree that it's not the body that matters so much as the amount of instructional time. But we also feel that most people voting on this tax imagine that, with it, districts would be getting enough cash to put a full-time art or music teacher in each elementary school – and that's not necessarily the case.

pomt-08336	"Most" of the newspapers that endorsed Alex Sink also endorsed Barack Obama.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/oct/28/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-most-newspapers-endorsed-sink-also/	During a debate with the candidates for Florida governor on Oct. 25, 2010, Republican Rick Scott and Democrat Alex Sink argued over newspaper endorsements. Sink said that she received the endorsements of 16 Florida newspapers: "Every single newspaper that has endorsed has endorsed my candidacy, because they know that I have the character and the integrity, and they also know that I have the business plan, that I'm a fiscal conservative to carry our state forward in a matter that all Floridians can be proud of." Later in the debate, Scott jeered back: "You talked about your endorsements by the newspapers. Absolutely, most of them endorsed Barack Obama. You're an Obama liberal. That's exactly why they're endorsing you." Another reason, of course, is that Scott has turned down requests to meet with newspaper editorial boards, so he didn't seek their endorsements anyway. Without buying into Scott's claim that Alex Sink = Obama liberal, we still wanted to fact-check whether most of the newspapers that endorsed Sink endorsed Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential campaign. Florida is usually considered a swing state, so we wondered if the endorsements lined up as Scott claimed. We looked up endorsements from 16 newspapers Sink mentioned. We also looked up two others: The Daytona Beach News-Journal no longer endorses candidates for office, saying that the paper instead preferred "to emphasize the independence of our news operation and its credibility in covering elections." The Lakeland Ledger endorsed Sink two days after the Oct. 25 debate, so we're not including it in our analysis. However, it also endorsed Obama in 2008. Our next task was to determine which of the 16 newspapers that endorsed Sink at the time of the debate also endorsed Obama. We determined that nine of 16 newspapers endorsed both Sink and Obama, including the St. Petersburg Times, the Miami Herald, the Orlando Sentinel and the Palm Beach Post. We found that three newspapers endorsed Sink this year and Republican John McCain for president in 2008: The Tampa Tribune, the Bradenton Herald, and the Spanish-language Miami-based Diario Las Americas. The remaining four newspapers endorsed Sink, but declined to endorse a candidate for president in 2008. Those papers were the Citrus County Chronicle, the Florida Times-Union in Jacksonville, the Fort Myers News-Press and the Tallahassee Democrat. (The Tallahassee Democrat has a policy of endorsing only local candidates.) One newspaper specifically mentioned Scott's charge that Sink is an "Obama liberal." The South Florida Sun Sentinel wrote, "Scott likes to tar Sink as an Obama liberal. The truth is Sink's economic platform is pro-business, and she hasn't been campaigning with the president. She doesn't have to. She's smart and accomplished enough to run on her own record." Here, we're steering clear of Scott's charge, but fact-checking his claim that "most" of the newspapers that endorsed Sink also endorsed Obama. We found that nine of 16 endorsed Obama. That's 56 percent. That's a bit shy of "most" -- it's a bare majority. Still, we find that enough newspapers endorsed both Sink and Obama that we rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-13330	Says state Sen. Morgan Carroll's votes made "it easier to sue doctors, small businesses, even nurses. Putting her own shady interests first."	false	/colorado/statements/2016/oct/05/mike-coffman/coffman-falsely-says-carroll-voted-make-it-easier-/	Colorado Republican Rep. Mike Coffman pulls no punches in an ad accusing his Democratic opponent, Morgan Carroll, of using her role as a state senator to benefit her "shady interests" as a trial lawyer. "Meet Morgan Carroll, state senator, who’s also Morgan Carroll, personal injury lawyer," the narrator says in the ad that aired Sept. 20. "Morgan Carroll the lawyer has worked for some of the sleaziest firms in the state. And they love frivolous lawsuits." The ad shows photos of Carroll on billboards next to slimy-looking lawyers. The narrator says the state senator’s votes resulted in "making it easier to sue doctors, small businesses, even nurses. Putting her own shady interests first." Coffman’s radio version of the ad goes further, accusing Carroll of "using her position in the state Senate to line her own pockets" and speaking about an "odor of corruption," the Denver Post reported. We took a hard look at Coffman’s TV ad claim that Carroll's votes resulted in "making it easier to sue doctors, small businesses, even nurses"to serve her "shady interests." Carroll became an attorney in 2000, and spent the first decade of her career working with her mother. Their firm mostly represented clients with disabilities, Carroll campaign spokesman Drew Godinich told PolitiFact. In an ad of her own, Carroll recalls that she was a girl when her dad was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease and she watched him get sicker as medical costs wiped out his retirement savings. "It's why I've dedicated my career to fighting for people with disabilities, helping people stay in their homes and receive the care they need," she says. More recently, Carroll worked for two big personal injury law firms whose TV commercials are well-known to Coloradans. She spent two years at the Sawaya Law Firm, then moved to Bachus & Schanker. The Bachus & Schanker website says, "Morgan Carroll specializes in representing people in personal injury, Workers' Compensation, Social Security Disability and employment law." Godinich said Carroll primarily was doing legal research at the firm until about four months ago when she took time off to devote herself to the race against Coffman for Colorado’s 6th Congressional District, a crescent-ring of Denver suburbs. The Coffman ad focuses on two bills Carroll worked on. One of them is the Good Samaritans in Health Care Act of 2006, which Coffman says Carroll opposed to make it "easier to sue"doctors and nurses. The Republican-sponsored bill granted immunity from civil liability to doctors, nurses and other medical professionals who volunteer at free medical clinics to help people in need. The Coffman ad is misleading. Carroll, who at the time was a House member, voted against the bill in committee after she and the Colorado Trial Lawyers Association raised concerns that the proposed immunity was too broad and could shield a medical professional when a patient was harmed by gross negligence. However, Carroll voted for the bill after it was amended on the floor to grant immunity to medical volunteers from civil liability when an "act or omission of a volunteer" resulted in injury, except in cases of gross negligence, reckless misconduct and even violent crimes -- acts that would prevent a volunteer from receiving immunity under the federal Volunteer Protection Act. Ultimately, Carroll supported passage of the law that made it harder -- not easier -- to sue volunteer doctors, nurses and other health-medical professionals -- unless there was evidence of gross negligence. Coffman’s claim that Carroll made it easier to sue small businesses, refers to the "Job Protection and Civil Rights Enforcement Act of 2013. "Carroll was a primary sponsor of the bill. State law already allowed someone who prevailed in a complaint about employment discrimination or unfair employment practices before the Colorado Civil Rights Commission to sue for back pay, future pay, or to be reinstated or hired if they were improperly fired or denied a job. Carroll’s bill allowed victims of employment discrimination who win a lawsuit to also receive compensatory and punitive damages in cases where it was proved an employer engaged in intentional discrimination. In addition, the bill allowed an employee to be awarded attorney’s fees and costs. But if a judge found a lawsuit was frivolous -- or unjustified -- the court could award attorney’s fees and costs to the employer. The bill capped the maximum compensatory and punitive damages at $10,000 for a business with fewer than five employees, and $25,000 for an employer with five to 14 workers, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Council’s fiscal analysis. The bill and the Legislative Council noted that while federal antidiscrimination laws allow compensatory and punitive damages, those laws don’t protect workers who are discriminated against because of their sexual orientation or if their employer has fewer than 15 employees. Carroll’s state bill allowed people to seek the increased damages when their employer had less than 15 employees or there was discrimination based on sexual orientation. So the legislation, which became law, didn’t make it "easier to sue" small businesses -- people could already do that -- but it did allow people the opportunity to win greater financial damages. What about Coffman’s accusation that Carroll engaged in a conflict of interest by voting on bills that financially benefited her work as a trial lawyer? We checked the Colorado Independent Ethics Commission’s records and found no evidence of an ethics complaint having been made against Carroll. The Legislature’s ethics rules state that a lawmaker has a personal or financial interest in legislation "if the passage or failure of such bill, measure, or question will result in the member deriving a direct financial or pecuniary benefit that is greater than any such benefit derived by or shared by other persons in the member's profession, occupation, industry, or region." But a lawmaker will not be deemed to have a personal or financial interest in a bill that "affects the entire membership of a class to which the member belongs." In a part-time "citizen legislature" like Colorado’s, this generally allows a doctor/lawmaker to vote on a health care bill, a teacher to vote on an educational bill, and a builder to vote on a construction bill. Our ruling Coffman says Carroll’s votes on state legislation made "it easier to sue doctors, small businesses, even nurses. Putting her own shady interests first." Carroll voted in committee against a bill to grant immunity from civil liability to doctors, nurses and other medical professionals who volunteer at free medical clinics. But Carroll voted for the bill after it was amended on the floor to shield most medical volunteers from lawsuits — except in cases of gross negligence. Carroll did sponsor and vote for an anti-employment discrimination bill that didn’t make it easier to sue small businesses, because existing law already allowed such suits. But her bill did allow for the awarding of compensatory and punitive damages and attorney’s fees against employers of all sizes, including small businesses. Coffman accuses Carroll, who has worked as a lawyer handling disability, employment, workers’ compensation and personal injury cases, of being sleazy and shady with conflicts of interest. But there's no evidence she violated state ethics laws. We rate this claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ee3b4dca-e5bf-4630-a661-ef96890b8b02	None	Mike Coffman	None	None	None	2016-10-05T16:38:43	2016-09-20	['None']
pomt-09300	"If the space-shuttle program is terminated, Russia and China will be the only nations ...with the capability to launch humans into space."	true	/texas/statements/2010/apr/21/kay-bailey-hutchison/sen-kay-bailey-hutchison-says-if-space-shuttle-pro/	Pushing a plan that would land astronauts on Mars within the next 30 years, President Barack Obama envisions private companies ferrying American astronauts to the International Space Station until rockets are devised to reach deep space. Not thrilled: U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas and the ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. Hutchison recently blasted a budget request Obama sent to Congress that effectively dashes hopes of funding additional space shuttle flights after the last mission slated for the end of this year. The station has been orbiting Earth some two hundred miles up since 1998. "We must close the gap in U.S. human space flight or face the reality that we will be totally dependent on Russia for access to space until the next generation of space vehicle is developed," Hutchison said in a March 3 press release. "If the space shuttle program is terminated, Russia and China will be the only nations in the world with the capability to launch humans into space." Hutchison introduced legislation the same day to delay the shuttle program's retirement until the United States develops its next-generation space vehicle. "The Administration proposes to retire the shuttle as scheduled while discontinuing years of work on development of a new launch vehicle and provides no short term solution to deliver critical equipment and components to the International Space Station that are essential to extending the life of the station until 2020," according to the press release. Ground control to Moscow and Beijing? Obama has elaborated on his NASA plan since Hutchison objected. On April 15, at a White House-sponsored space conference at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Obama outlined his vision for space exploration, which included restoring a space capsule that could be used as an emergency escape vehicle for crew members on the space station. The president still wants to shelve the 30-year-old shuttle program as planned. He said, however, "we will work with a growing array of private companies competing to make getting to space easier and more affordable." The shuttle program's last flight is expected to occur in September. By 2025, under Obama's plan, the U.S. would have a spacecraft capable of carrying astronauts into deep space; trips to Mars would begin in the mid-2030s. And NASA would have until 2015 to finalize plans for a heavy-lift rocket to carry astronauts beyond the Earth's orbit. Where does that leave Hutchison's claim that if the shuttle program is shuttered, Russia and China will be the only nations capable of launching humans into space? For starters: John Yembrick, a spokesman at the NASA office of space operations, told us that between the time the space-shuttle program is set to shut down later this year until the commercial sector becomes capable of sending astronauts into orbit — lately projected at 2015 — American astronauts would travel into space on Russian spacecrafts. Next, the Senate Commerce Committee pointed us to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) website, where we brushed up on space-race history. The Soviet Union launched the first satellite to orbit Earth in 1957. Yuri Gargarin, a Russian, became the first person to travel in space in 1961; Americans Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were the first to set foot on the moon in 1969. In 2003, China sent its first astronaut into space. In 2004, test pilot Michael Melvill became the first astronaut launched into space by a private company — Scaled Composites of Mojave, California. Most U.S. astronauts work for NASA, and live and train at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston. Their Russian counterparts, cosmonauts, train near Moscow and launch from and land in Kazakhstan, the nation sharing part of Russia's southeast border. NASA launches astronauts into space aboard shuttles while cosmonauts travel aboard space vehicles called Soyuz, which, unlike the shuttles, are not reusable. Both 'nauts helped build and then worked aboard the space station. Byron Tapley, director of the Center for Space Research at the University of Texas at Austin, said other countries are striving to launch people into space, including India, Japan, Ecuador, Iran and Malaysia. "India and Japan are the most developed of this set," Tapley said. "But neither is very close to being able to claim 'current capability.' The capability for safely placing a human in orbit is much more demanding than the capability for placing a satellite in orbit." We rate Hutchison's statement as True.

pomt-04534	Says 7,000 millionaires "gamed the system to pay no income taxes."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/sep/30/tammy-baldwin/7000-millionaires-gamed-system-pay-zero-federal-in/	U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., sounds a populist theme when she says she wants all Americans to pay their fair share f taxes. It’s part of an effort to brand herself as a fighter for the middle class and to contrast herself with her U.S. Senate opponent, former Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson, whom she casts as a wealthy Washington insider. In that vein, Baldwin sent a fund-raising email to supporters Sept. 22, 2012 repeating a claim that Thompson wants to raise taxes on the middle class in order to give tax breaks to millionaires like himself. We previously rated that claim Half True- the millionaires part of Baldwin’s claim was correct, but the middle class part far less clear. In the same email, Baldwin got more specific. She claimed she "is fighting for a country where opportunity exists for everyone -- not just the 7,000 millionaires who gamed the system to pay no income taxes on their fortunes." Did 7,000 millionaires pay no income taxes because they "gamed the system"? 7,000 millionaires, no taxes Baldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus cited as evidence a table published in July 2011 by the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution in Washington. The center estimated that 7,000 households that earned "cash income" of more than $1 million in 2011 paid no federal income tax. That’s an estimate based on taxpayer data, not a hard number. Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the center, told us the center now believes the figure is 4,000 millionaires, but said he doesn't fault Baldwin for using the larger number given that the table has not been revised. The 7,000 figure has been widely cited on the Internet. As for the "cash income" measure, it includes compensation that isn’t taxable, such as employer-provided health insurance. Williams said the Tax Policy Center viewed that as a more accurate way of defining millionaires, but he acknowledged it is a broader measure than what the Internal Revenue Service uses. Indeed, that’s what The Washington Post Fact Checker found in examining the 7,000 figure in April 2012, nine months after publication of the table Baldwin relies on. If adjusted gross income -- the figure at the bottom of your 1040 tax form -- is used, 1,470 millionaires paid no federal income taxes in 2009, according to the most recent IRS figure available. According to the Tax Foundation, another Washington, D.C., research group, the figure dropped to 1,403 in 2010. As for millionaires as a class, according to the Tax Foundation, millionaires paid an effective tax rate of 25 percent and paid 22 percent of all federal income taxes collected in 2010. So, Baldwin relied on a respected group for the 7,000 figure, but the number is actually smaller, and that had been established months before she made her claim. Gaming the system The second part of Baldwin's claim -- that millionaires who paid no federal income taxes had somehow "gamed the system" -- suggests they did something improper. Kraus, Baldwin’s spokesman, provided as evidence a May 2012 news article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel about Beloit billionaire Diane Hendricks, who serves as treasurer of Thompson's campaign. The article said Hendricks paid no state income tax in 2010, which was attributed to a change in the corporate structure of a company she owned. But Baldwin's claim was about federal taxes. So at best, Kraus is off point. Williams, of the Tax Policy Center, said the roughly 1 percent of millionaires who pay no federal income taxes are able to do so because some sources of their income aren’t taxed and because of deductions provided in the tax code. Aside from employer-provided health insurance, other types of income that aren’t taxed include tax-exempt municipal bonds. In addition, some high earners, such as certain hedge fund managers, can avoid higher tax rates by receiving more of their pay as capital gains rather than earned income. Items that can reduce a millionaire’s taxes to zero include credits for taxes paid on income received in foreign nations, and deductions for charitable contributions made, as well as for state and local taxes paid. Scott Hodge, president of the Tax Foundation, agreed that foreign tax credits and deductions for charitable contributions are key reasons why some high earners pay no federal income tax. Another big reason is many of those households own businesses that suffered losses, he said. Hodge said none of those factors constitutes having "gamed the system." Indeed, when it was disclosed in September 2012 that GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney said 47 percent of Americans pay no federal income taxes, PolitiFact National rated his statement True. Utilizing Tax Policy Center research, our colleagues found that about half of people who don’t pay income taxes are simply poor, and the tax code explicitly exempts them, while the rest benefit from tax breaks. Williams said that if people feel there is something wrong with a system that allows some people to pay no income taxes, they should work to "fix the system, don’t complain about people doing perfectly legal things." Our rating Baldwin said 7,000 millionaires "gamed the system to pay no income taxes." But her figure is high and she provides no evidence that millionaires "gamed the system." What’s clear is they worked within the system, however flawed it may or may not be. We rate Baldwin’s statement False.	None	Tammy Baldwin	None	None	None	2012-09-30T09:00:00	2012-09-22	['None']

pomt-07338	"American oil production is at its highest level since 2003."	true	/virginia/statements/2011/may/11/jim-moran/jim-moran-says-us-oil-production-highest-level-03/	With gas prices averaging $3.97 a gallon in the United States, Congress is taking up energy legislation that offers good talking points, if not immediate relief at the pump. On May 5, the House passed the "Restarting Offshore Leasing Now Act," a measure aimed at forcing the Department of the Interior to auction offshore drilling leases in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of Virginia during the next year. Oil companies would bid for the leases and then build drilling rigs at the sites. The measure won virtually unanimous support from Republicans, as well as votes from 33 Democrats. But Rep. Jim Moran, D-8th, opposed the measure and criticized it in a press release. Moran said the bill was about "currying favor" with the oil industry, not cutting energy prices. He said drilling off the Virginia coast could interfere with Navy training operations. Furthermore, Moran said, "American oil production is at its highest level since 2003." We wondered if America’s oil wells are really pumping their highest output in eight years. The Energy Information Administration, part of the Department of Energy, is the clearinghouse for U.S. and global data on oil production and consumption. According to EIA data, the U.S. produced 5.5 million barrels of oil per day in 2010, up from 5.4 million barrels per day in 2009. That is indeed the highest number since 2003, when production was 5.7 million barrels per day. It’s interesting to note that U.S. production for the past decade has been below 6 million barrels a day. In the 1970s, production ranged from 8.1 million to 9.6 million barrels a day. And through most of the 1980s, it was above 8 million barrels a day. In March, after President Barack Obama made the same claim as Moran, PolitiFact’s national staff reviewed the statement. Rather than study the daily average, they reviewed the annual number of barrels produced. Here are the annual totals for barrels produced, going back to 2003. 2003: 2,073,453,000 2004: 1,983,302,000 2005: 1,890,106,000 2006: 1,862,259,000 2007: 1,848,450,000 2008: 1,811,817,000 2009: 1,956,596,000 2010: 2,011,856,000 When PolitiFact national first reviewed this claim, the EIA was expecting to see a 110,000 barrels-per-day decline in production during 2011, followed by another 200,000 barrels-per-day drop in 2012. But an updated May energy outlook projected a decline of only 20,000 barrels per day, followed by an additional 60,000 barrels per day decline in 2012. The agency said the reductions would come largely in Alaska, due to maturing oil fields, and the Gulf of Mexico. If you’re curious, U.S. demand for crude oil was about 18.8 million barrels per day during 2009 and 19.1 million barrels per day during 2010. The daily global demand for oil during 2009 was 84.3 million barrels per day, meaning the U.S. accounted for 22 percent of the world’s oil consumption that year. As we’ve reported before, the U.S. possesses about 1.5 percent of the world’s proven oil reserves. Let’s review. Moran said, "American oil production is at its highest level since 2003." He’s right that production hit a seven-year peak in 2010. The government projects a decline could be imminent. But at this point, there is no solid evidence that the decline has begun. When PolitiFact national evaluated this issue in March, the EIA was projecting a sizable production decline this year. They have since significantly lowered their projections on how much production will fall. We rate Moran’s statement True.

pomt-13998	Says Donald Trump said the U.S. should "encourage" Japan to get nuclear weapons.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/06/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-donald-trump-argued-us-should/	During a high-profile foreign policy speech, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton repeated a series of past statements by Donald Trump to show that her Republican rival poses risks for international relations. One of these past statements by Trump involved whether Japan should become a nuclear-armed state. "It's no small thing when he suggests that America should withdraw our military support for Japan, encourage them to get nuclear weapons," Clinton said in her June 2, 2016, speech. Is Clinton correct that Trump encouraged Japan to get nuclear weapons? What Trump has said As we noted earlier, Clinton’s evidence includes interviews and comments Trump has made on the campaign trail. When Trump sat for a March 26 interview with the New York Times, he was asked directly, "Would you object if (Japan) got their own nuclear arsenal, given the threat that they face from North Korea and China?" Trump responded in part, "There’ll be a point at which we’re just not going to be able to do it anymore. Now, does that mean nuclear? It could mean nuclear. It’s a very scary nuclear world. Biggest problem, to me, in the world, is nuclear, and proliferation. At the same time, you know, we’re a country that doesn’t have money." Let’s set aside Trump’s internal inconsistency -- saying that Japan might need nuclear weapons, and then, just seconds later, saying that the world’s "biggest problem" is nuclear proliferation. If you read his words closely, Trump didn’t quite say he was encouraging Japan to get nuclear weapons, but he did go right up to the line. He was leaving the option on the table. Having seen Trump’s comments to the New York Times, CNN’s Anderson Cooper asked him about it in a CNN town hall in Milwaukee on March 29. Answering Cooper’s question about breaking with Japan’s non-nuclear stance, Trump said, "At some point we have to say, you know what, we're better off if Japan protects itself against this maniac in North Korea." In fact, during the town hall, Cooper gave Trump multiple opportunities to back off his suggestion that Japan may need nuclear weapons, but Trump never did. He said, in succession, "maybe it's going to have to be time to change," "at some point we have to say, you know what, we're better off," "it's going to happen, anyway," and "wouldn't you rather in a certain sense have Japan have nuclear weapons?" That may not fit the strict definition of encouraging Japan to get nuclear weapons, but again, it’s very close. Finally, Trump said something similar on the April 3 edition of Fox News Sunday, when host Chris Wallace pressed Trump on his past comments. After Wallace asked whether Trump wanted to see a nuclear arms race on the Korean peninsula, Trump said, "It's not like, gee whiz, nobody has them. So, North Korea has nukes. Japan has a problem with that. I mean, they have a big problem with that. Maybe they would in fact be better off if they defend themselves from North Korea." Wallace interjected, "With nukes?" Trump responded, "Maybe they would be better off -- including with nukes, yes, including with nukes." How unusual this position is We also asked nuclear policy experts whether Trump’s stated position -- not specifically encouraging Japan to get nuclear weapons, but saying he would be open to it -- was an unusual view, as Clinton suggested. They said it was. "The prevailing, bipartisan and fairly settled academic judgment has been that the risk of loose nukes or accidental nuclear war means that every additional nuclear weapon is a potential cataclysm waiting to happen," said Richard Nephew, a fellow with the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. "I'm not aware of anyone that I'd deem to be a serious policy proponent or thinker who has seriously advocated this in a while." The last major figure Nephew could think of is Kenneth Waltz, an international relations scholar who articulated a "realist" view -- discussed in this 1981 paper -- that said the wide spread of nuclear weapons would create such risks to using them that no country ever would. However, "by the 1960s, most folks had decided that was a horrible idea," Nephew said. "You'd be hard pressed to find anyone saying that since the end of the Cold War." Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, agreed. The statements were so out of the mainstream that "our allies in Japan and the rest of Asia are already alarmed by those statements. Mr. Trump’s suggestion that a nuclear-armed Japan would make the United States or Japan safer is radical and highly dangerous, and is without precedent for a major party presidential nominee." Our ruling Clinton took Trump to task for saying that the United States should "encourage" Japan to get nuclear weapons. Trump used vague and contradictory language, but it’s a fair reading to say his words amounted to encouragement. On more than one occasion, Trump publicly said that Japan, and the United States, might be better off if Japan had nuclear weapons, and he declined multiple attempts by interviewers to backtrack from that view.

pomt-04846	The Obama administration is "unwinding our nation’s welfare-to-work requirements."	false	/virginia/statements/2012/aug/13/bob-mcdonnell/bob-mcdonnell-says-obama-unwinding-welfare-work-re/	Gov. Bob McDonnell is accusing the Obama administration of reversing federal welfare laws that require people who receive public aid to be on a path towards finding a job. McDonnell has joined a number of Republicans -- including presidential nominee Mitt Romney -- in criticizing the administration’s announcement in July that states will be allowed to seek waivers from welfare-to-work requirements passed in 1996 under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. Those reforms tied block welfare grants for states to work requirements and limit the amount of time a person can receive benefits. "By unwinding our nation’s welfare-to-work requirements, the Obama administration is making a tragic mistake," McDonnell wrote in an August 6 op-ed that ran in the Richmond Times-Dispatch and is posted on McDonnell’s political website and Romney’s campaign website. Is Obama "unwinding" those requirements? We checked. Tucker Martin, a spokesman for the governor, backed McDonnell’s statement by citing editorials that take aim at the administration’s decision. Martin also emailed us an Associated Press article saying the White House has "quietly opened the door for states to seek major changes in how they meet federal welfare-to-work requirements for some of their poorest residents." The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced the waiver program on July 12, saying exemptions would be granted to allow states to "test alternative and innovative strategies, policies and procedures that are designed to improve employment outcomes for needy families." The directive said "HHS will only consider approving waivers relating to the work participation requirements that make changes intended to lead to more effective means of meeting the work goals of TANF." The department said if a test project does not result in improved employment for welfare recipients, the waiver could be revoked. George Sheldon, an assistant secretary at HHS, said in a July 12 letter to state human services officials that the administration’s move stemmed from a February 28, 2011 presidential memorandum that called on federal agencies to work with state governments to remove regulatory barriers that undermine federal programs. As a result, Sheldon said HHS held talks with state, local and tribal officials about many issues -- including TANF. "During those consultations, many jurisdictions expressed a strong interest in greater flexibility in TANF and indicated that greater flexibility could be used by states to improve program effectiveness," Sheldon said. "We also heard concerns that some TANF rules stifle innovation and focus attention on paperwork rather than helping parents find jobs." The move caused an uproar among conservatives who argued the change was a bid to sneak around welfare-to-work requirements. Romney went a step further in a TV ad that started running last week in Virginia and other swing states, saying, under Obama’s plan, "you wouldn’t have to work and wouldn’t have to train for a job. They just send you your welfare check." Our colleagues at PolitiFact National rated that claim Pants on Fire in an August 7 story. Politifact noted that through the changes, the administration is hoping to make the welfare-to-work efforts more successful -- not end them altogether. FactCheck.org examined that ad’s claim that the adminstration’s decision would "gut welfare reform by dropping work requirements." It concluded, "The plan does neither of those things." It should be noted that the Republican governors of Utah and Nevada have expressed interest in obtaining waivers from TANF requirements in order to boost employment for welfare recipients. "Nevada is very interested in working with your staff to explore program waivers that have the potential to encourage more cooperative relationships among state agencies engaged in economic stimulus through job creation, employment skill attainment and gainful employment activities," Michael Willden, director of Nevada’s Department of Health and Human Services said in an August 2, 2011 letter to HHS. Mary-Sarah Kinner, a spokeswoman for Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, said that although state officials discussed the possibility of a waiver, the state never requested one and doesn’t intend to. But Utah officials have asked for a waiver. "Utah’s goal through all of this is to increase work-related outcomes, and we felt that this waiver would better allow us to achieve that goal," said Nic Dunn, a spokesman for Utah Gov. Gary Herbert. A final note: There’s a dispute about whether the administration is allowed to provide these waivers. Although HHS says it can, Republicans maintain the 1996 law doesn’t allow the executive branch to grant waivers to the work rules. Our Ruling McDonnell said the Obama administration is "unwinding" welfare-to-work requirements. But a new Obama program does not end welfare-to-work mandates. To the contrary, it strengthens the requirements by granting waivers to states seeking to make the work requirements more successful. The waivers would be granted to pilot programs that are individually evaluated; HHS is not proposing a blanket national change to welfare law. We rate McDonnell’s statement False.

pomt-14012	Says she was the first in her family to go to a four-year college.	pants on fire!	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/jun/03/katie-mcginty/rating-katie-mcgintys-curious-campaign-college-cla/	Katie McGinty comes from a working class upbringing, as she routinely tells voters. The senate candidate was the ninth of 10 kids of a restaurant hostess and a police officer. She grew up in Rhawnhurst. She’s hosted numerous campaign events at diners. But what’s drawn the most scrutiny over the last few days are the statements she’s made about college. The third paragraph on the about page of McGinty’s website touts a claim we often hear about candidates from less privileged upbringings: "She was the first in her family to go to a four-year college." Keep an eye on that phrasing. Throughout her campaign, McGinty has returned to this theme. She was quoted by the AP in January saying, "As the ninth of 10 kids and the first in my family to go to college, I’ve been privileged to live the American dream." This week, McGinty’s account tweeted what appeared to be a comment from a college student saying "Katie understands what I’m going through. She was the 1st in her family to go to a 4-year college & didn’t let anything hold her back." Then Buzzfeed revealed late Wednesday that one of McGinty’s older brothers had attended and graduated from LaSalle University nearly a decade before McGinty entered St. Joseph’s. The brother, John Patrick McGinty, Jr., first attended the Community College of Philadelphia and then graduated from La Salle in 1973 with a bachelor of arts degree, according to the 1973 commencement program. A spokesperson for La Salle confirmed to Billy Penn the university was a four-year college, and that to graduate from the university, one would have to attend the university. McGinty graduated from St. Joseph’s in 1985, according to a list of notable alumni from the university, and started there in 1981, according to her LinkedIn page. Through campaign spokesperson Josh Levitt, brother John provided this statement: "The way that Katie and our family have always talked about our experience is she was the first of the 10 McGinty kids to attend and graduate from a four-year college, straight out of high school. We were all really proud of that, just as we were proud that I earned my degree by completing a two-year program and then enrolling in La Salle." Our ruling U.S. Senate candidate Katie McGinty’s campaign website claims she was first person in her family to go to a four-year college. She’s elided this statement further through the course of her campaign. But documentation from La Salle, a four-year institution, shows her brother, John McGinty, graduated from the university in 1973 with a bachelor’s of arts, and the university confirmed to Buzzfeed he started attending the school in 1971. John took a different route to a four-year college by first attending Philadelphia Community College, so McGinty was the first in her family to attend *only* a four-year college directly out of high school. But the language used on McGinty’s website and at other times throughout her campaign doesn’t include this important distinction. We rate McGinty’s claim Pants On Fire.

pomt-02867	One of the "main functions" of the Department of Homeland Security’s SAVE database is "checking voter registration citizenship status."	false	/florida/statements/2013/nov/14/ken-detzner/main-functions-save-database-department-homeland-s/	Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner has been on a public relations mission to defend his plan to use federal Homeland Security data to search for noncitizens on the voting rolls. The key to the revamped process is using a federal resource of data, called the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE. Detzner defended the use of SAVE for voter registration purposes during a Nov. 4 hearing before the Senate committee on ethics and elections. He said using SAVE to check voter registration is one of its primary uses. "In fact, Homeland Security’s ‘benefit categories’ lists checking voter registration citizenship status as one of its main functions. The federal government allows SAVE to be used and check legal status as part of an ensuring the eligibility of registered voters." Detzner said SAVE is used nationwide to verify citizenship for entitlement programs (such as Medicaid), so he argued that the state should be confident that it will provide credible information for elections officials. "SAVE has really been a game-changer when it comes to (voter) list maintenance," he said. We wanted to check this part of Detzner’s claim: Does Homeland Security list checking voter registration citizenship status as one of its main functions? Is voter registration one of the main purposes of SAVE? A document from the Department of Homeland Security lists reasons that government agencies routinely use SAVE to check citizenship status, and the list includes voter registration purposes. Implemented in 1987, SAVE was originally intended to verify eligibility for government benefits, programs and licensing, including Medicaid or welfare, driver’s licenses, government education loans, unemployment compensation, housing assistance or tax exemptions. Over the years, the uses have expanded. SAVE is intended to show if someone is not a citizen, but it does not contain a database of people who are U.S. citizens. That’s why some voting rights groups have argued that SAVE is not a foolproof method to clean up the voter rolls. We wondered what the data said on how often SAVE was used to check voter registration. SAVE includes a query code number for each type of benefit, and agencies are also assigned individual codes. For fiscal year 2013, SAVE had 13,220,774 queries nationwide. The most common query was for driver’s licenses -- that represented about one-third of the queries, or about 4.5 million. Another big category was queries relating to Social Security; those added up to more than 3.5 million. DHS compiled the number of nationwide queries for voter registration and found 13,100 -- so less than 1 percent of the 13 million queries. (In fiscal year 2013 in Florida, there were about one million SAVE queries by Florida agencies, and the majority were for driver’s licenses and health and social services.) We sent Detzner’s spokeswoman a summary of our nationwide findings and asked for any documentation to support that one of the main functions of SAVE is to check voter registration. "The secretary’s comment was about the primary functions of SAVE," said Brittany Lesser in an email. "The document you reference and the DHS quote both verify SAVE’s purposes, which includes checking voter registration. Most of the current uses of SAVE pertain to benefits or licenses. One category pertains to "badging agencies" that need to determine eligibility to access certain facilities. The list also includes "agencies that check citizenship status for voter registration." Voter registration was listed second to last on the list, but DHS spokesman Steven Blando told PolitiFact Florida that the order of uses has no significance. We asked Blando does DHS consider voter registration to be a "main function" of SAVE? "The SAVE database was not designed for this purpose and does not contain information about citizens born in the United States," Blando said. "It is not a main function by volume or number of agencies." Not all states use SAVE to check voter information. In 2005, Maricopa County, Ariz., was the first agency to enter into an agreement with the SAVE Program for voter registration, and a few other counties in Arizona were added later, according to DHS spokesman Christopher Bentley. By 2013, Florida, Colorado, Iowa and North Carolina had reached similar agreements. States with pending applications to use SAVE for voter lists include Georgia, Kansas, Michigan, Mississippi, Oregon, Tennessee and Virginia. Our ruling Detzner told state legislators that one of the "main functions" of the Department of Homeland Security’s SAVE database is "checking voter registration citizenship status." A federal document lists voter registration as one of the benefits that SAVE data can be used for to check citizenship status. However, we found no documentation to support Detzner’s claim that voter registration is one of its "main functions." SAVE is primarily used for agencies to check citizenship status for public benefits or driver’s licenses. Using SAVE to check voter registration eligibility is a more recent use, and only in effect in four states, plus a few Arizona counties. For fiscal year 2013, voter registration queries equaled less than 1 percent of the searches. We rate this claim False.	None	Ken Detzner	None	None	None	2013-11-14T10:00:00	2013-11-04	['None']

pomt-09593	The House health care bill provides for "free abortion services, and probably forced participation in abortions by members of the medical profession."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/21/chain-email/chain-e-mail-claims-house-health-care-bill-would-p/	A chain e-mail written by former attorney Michael Connelly -- which blasts the Democrats' health care plan as unconstitutional -- was penned in August, but continues to make the rounds. Although many of the issues in the e-mail have been addressed in previous PolitiFact items, we continue to get queries about it. So we've decided to visit -- or revisit -- several claims made in the e-mail. In this item, we will address the claim that HR 3200, "The Affordable Health Care Choices Act of 2009," would provide for "free abortion services, and probably forced participation in abortions by members of the medical profession." In the health care debate, abortion coverage has been a moving target as provisions have changed in various versions of the House and Senate bills. And we should note that Connelly wrote his e-mail back in August, long before the bills came to the floors of the two chambers. The House ultimately passed a health care bill that included an abortion amendment that essentially renders Connelly's argument moot. Still, Connelly said in an interview with PolitiFact on Jan. 20, 2010, that the same concerns he raised about the House bill back in August apply to the version of the health care bill passed by the Senate. Before we address that, let's back up a step. Although the original health care reform bills introduced in both the House and Senate were silent on abortion, the issue came to a head in late July when the House Energy and Commerce Committee passed an amendment offered by Rep. Lois Capps, D-Calif., which sought to make abortion coverage available in both the public plan and in private plans participating in the exchange, but paid exclusively through patient premiums, not government subsidies. Under that amendment, insurers would not be required to offer, or be prohibited from offering, abortion services in order to participate in the exchange. It also provided "conscience protections" so that any insurance plan participating in the exchange could not discriminate against hospitals or other health care facilities (such as Catholic hospitals) unwilling to provide abortions. That was largely the working House plan when Connelly penned his e-mail. And by that measure, we think Connelly was wrong when he said the bill would provide free abortions. Insurance purchased through private insurers on the exchange or the public option would not be "free." In fact, the amendment required that abortion coverage be paid through premiums paid by the insured. And Connelly's claim that the bill would probably mean "forced participation in abortions by members of the medical profession," was specifically prohibited in "conscience protection" measures in the amendment. And that all became moot in November 2009, when a group of Democrats led by Rep. Bart Stupak of Michigan forced a vote on an amendment that included tight restrictions barring any insurance plan that is purchased with government subsidies from covering abortions. It passed. Connelly said the concerns he raised in his August e-mail no longer apply to the House bill. But they still apply to the bill that passed the Senate, he said. The abortion language in the Senate bill is close to that in the Capps Amendment (though the Senate plan does not include a public option). As with the earlier House bill, the Senate plan would allow insurance companies on the exchange to offer abortion services. But for the same reasons we mentioned about the earlier House plan, we think it's a distortion to say it would provide "free abortions." And as in the earlier House bill, there are specific "conscience protections" written into the bill that make it clear doctors could not be discriminated against for opting not to provide abortions. So under the bill, no doctors would be forced to provide abortions. In other words, the claim was false when Connelly made it; it's moot now with regard to the House bill; and it's false with regard to the Senate bill. In other words, under no version of the plan then or now is Connelly's statement accurate. And we rate the claim False.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2010-01-21T17:37:57	2009-08-28	['None']
pomt-09409	The Democratic health care plan is a "government takeover of nearly 20 percent of our economy."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2010/mar/19/republican-party-florida/florida-republican-party-claims-democratic-health-/	If you've been following the health care debate, you've surely heard this line from Republicans: The Democratic plan is a "government takeover" of the nation's health care system. That's a potent talking point for the GOP because it conjures images of a sluggish, state-run bureaucracy. The Republican Party of Florida used it in a March 19, 2010, news release intended to pressure Democratic U.S. Rep. Allen Boyd, who represents a conservative district in north Florida, to vote against the bill. (It didn't work. He announced a few hours later he was supporting the bill.) The release said: "This morning while Congressman Allen Boyd is deciding whether or not he’ll support the trillion dollar Obama-Pelosi-Reid government-run health care experiment, and since the voicemail boxes at his offices are full, the Republican Party of Florida decided to remind the Congressman of what some of his constituents had to say about the government takeover of nearly 20 percent of our economy." The release had links to YouTube videos of people speaking against the plan at Boyd's town hall meetings. The RPOF's wording is slightly different than the most recent version we checked, when U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young made the claim in a speech to Pinellas County Republicans. But it's still just as wrong. Before we delve into the big reasons why it's wrong, we should note that the sentence has a tiny element of truth -- that health care accounts for nearly 20 percent of the economy. Indeed, the latest estimate by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services says that health care accounted for 17.3 percent of the economy last year and is expected to grow to 19.3 percent by 2019. But that's a thin gruel of accuracy in a false claim that has been repeated many times, despite being discredited by PolitiFact, FactCheck.org and other news organizations. By any reasonable definition, there's no way the Democratic plan could be considered a government takeover. Indeed, the plan's primary approach is to set up new systems to encourage private health insurance companies to compete to provide more coverage and better services. The cornerstone of the Democratic program is actually the status quo. The majority of Americans would continue to get health coverage the way they do now -- from private insurance companies. That coverage would be paid for the same way it is now -- by private employers and individual premiums. That's not a government takeover. The biggest change in the Democratic plan is the creation of health care exchanges that are supposed to provide coverage for Americans who have trouble getting it now -- people who are self-employed or work for small companies. The exchanges -- one in each state -- would be virtual marketplaces where people could shop for the best coverage. Although a government-run "public option" was included in the version of the bill that first passed the House, it is not in the current bill under consideration. The one significant element of the plan that would increase government's role in providing coverage is the expansion of Medicaid. Under the latest version, Medicaid would be expanded to cover anyone below 133 percent of poverty level. That's estimated to add about 18 million people to Medicaid rolls. Still, that's far short of a "government takeover," a phrase that suggests a complete government-run health care system. So once again, we are faced with over-the-top rhetoric about the health care plan. It's perfectly legitimate to raise questions about the plan and the government's role, but it's wildly incorrect to label it a government takeover. Yes, the plan would expand the government's role, but it primarily would continue to rely on private insurers for the vast majority of Americans. And, for people who have trouble getting coverage, it would create a marketplace so people could shop for coverage from private insurers. It's ridiculously false to call that a government takeover. Once again, we need to strike a match and set the meter ablaze. Pants on Fire!	None	Republican Party of Florida	None	None	None	2010-03-19T15:26:51	2010-03-19	['Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-03668	"In barely four years in office, five jihadists have reached their targets in the United States under Barack Obama," compared to zero "in over seven years after 9/11 under George W. Bush."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/26/tom-cotton/rep-tom-cotton-says-more-terrorists-have-reached-t/	During a House floor speech just days after the Boston Marathon bombing, Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., sought to compare President Barack Obama’s record on terrorism unfavorably to that of Obama’s predecessor in the White House, George W. Bush. "I rise today to express grave doubts about the Obama administration’s counterterrorism policies and programs. ..." Cotton said. "In barely four years in office, five jihadists have reached their targets in the United States under Barack Obama: the Boston Marathon Bomber, the Underwear Bomber, the Times Square Bomber, the Fort Hood shooter, and, in my own state, the Little Rock recruiting office shooter. In over seven years after 9/11, under George W. Bush, how many terrorists reached their targets in the United States? Zero. We need to ask: Why is the Obama administration failing in its mission to stop terrorism before it reaches its targets in the United States?" In the Boston attack, Dzokhar Tsarnaev has been charged with carrying out the bombing with his brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was killed while being chased by police. As for the other terrorist plots Cotton referenced, here are brief summaries: Umar Farook Abdulmutallab became known as the "underwear bomber" on Dec. 25, 2009, after he tried to blow up a plane flying to Detroit using a bomb strapped to his underwear. He was convicted and is serving life in prison. Faisal Shahzad tried to plant a bomb in New York City’s Times Square on May 1, 2010. Bystanders discovered the bomb and the police were able to keep it from going off. Shahzad pleaded guilty and is serving life in prison. Nidal Hasan, a psychiatrist and major in the U.S. Army Medical Corps, is the only suspect in a shooting rampage at Fort Hood, Texas, that left 13 soldiers and civilians dead and more than two dozen others wounded on Nov. 5, 2009. Hasan is awaiting a military trial that could bring the death penalty. Prior to the shootings, the government intercepted at least 18 emails between Hasan and Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born cleric tied to al-Qaida. Abdulhakim Muhammed, a convert to Islam who was born Carlos Bledsoe, pleaded guilty to killing Pvt. William Long and wounding Pvt. Quinton Ezeagwula during a shooting outside a U.S. Army recruiting station in Little Rock, Ark., in 2009. He is now serving life in prison. However, Cotton’s comparison requires some creative accounting. Here are some of the problems with Cotton’s claim: • He ignores at least two post-9/11 examples of jihad-inspired terrorism under Bush that resulted in casualties. One is the July 4, 2002, incident in which Hesham Mohamed Hadayet, an Egyptian immigrant, fired on an El Al ticket counter at Los Angeles International Airport, killing two. The other is the March 2006 case of Mohammed Reza Taheri-azar, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill graduate, driving an SUV onto campus, striking nine pedestrians, resulting in injuries but no fatalities. Both cases were reportedly motivated by radical Islam. • He uses inconsistent definitions of "reached their targets." "Reached their targets" can mean either "reach the point of carrying out an attack" or "actually carrying out an attack." If it’s "reach the point of carrying out an attack," then Cotton is ignoring not just the two Bush-era examples above, but also the Dec. 22, 2001, "shoe-bombing" incident, in which Richard Reid was foiled trying to detonate plastic explosives packed in his shoes. It would be inconsistent for Cotton to exclude the shoe-bomber (who tried to strike during Bush’s tenure) when he includes the "underwear bomber" (whose plot came under Obama) when both were stopped before exploding their devices. If the standard is to "reach the point of carrying out an attack," then we count three post 9/11 terrorist plots by Islamic radicals under Bush and five under Obama -- a difference, but not one as stark as Cotton’s calculation. If the standard is "actually carrying out an attack," then the count would be two under Bush and three under Obama, which is even less of a difference. • Blaming the president for terrorist attacks on their watch has limited value. For starters, the nuts and bolts of preventing terrorist attacks is handled by career government officials in such agencies as the CIA and the FBI -- officials who are likely carrying out their duties regardless of who the president is. In addition, Cotton’s formulation doesn’t take into account plots in which arrests were made before aspiring terrorists have "reached their targets." When we raised some of these issues with Cotton’s office, a spokeswoman provided a rebuttal from the congressman. "Neither the Los Angeles airport shooter nor the UNC driver had a documented history of association with terrorist groups, as did the five attackers in the Obama years," the statement from Cotton said. "As for the shoe bomber, he was a foreigner screened by a foreign agency (French) without significant American assistance and with a foreign target (international waters). By contrast, the underwear bomber was screened with American input and reached his target over a major American city (Detroit)." Cotton’s statement continued, "These three persons you cited from the Bush years hadn't been on a government list or subject to investigation, while all five attackers in the Obama years were. Finally, reaching the target means reaching the point of intended attack, not necessarily executing the attack. Counting on terrorist incompetence isn’t a sound counterterrorism strategy." We should note that Cotton’s comments on the House floor didn’t include these kinds of qualifiers, but we decided to explore the merits of their argument anyway. We asked Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism expert who is a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, what he thought of Cotton’s arguments. He said they have at least partial merit. As we have noted in a previous item, there are several cases under Obama in which future perpetrators of terrorists acts had already gotten themselves onto the U.S. government’s radar screen, including Muhammed, Hasan and Abdulmutallab, as opposed to none during the Bush years. Gartenstein-Ross says it’s reasonable to have greater concern about cases in which the government had looked into an individual but did not end up preventing an attack. A possible counter-argument is that the lack of a "documented history of association with terrorist groups" that Cotton cites could instead be considered a reflection of poor intelligence work. Advance suspicion that an individual might be a terrorist could be a point of distinction between the shoe bomber and the underwear bomber, he added, since the underwear bomber’s father sent the U.S. an urgent warning and nothing equivalent happened with the shoe bomber. On the other hand, we doubt the shoe bomber, as Cotton suggests, intended to attack international waters; his target, like the underwear bomber’s, was a U.S.-based airline filled with passengers, many of them Americans. Ultimately, Gartenstein-Ross said, it is an "appropriate question to ask" whether the Obama administration has "in some way put into place policies that hamper investigations or aggressive action." Still, he said, the congressman’s statement was, "like a lot of rhetoric, overheated." Our ruling Cotton said, "In barely four years in office, five jihadists have reached their targets in the United States under Barack Obama," compared to zero "in over seven years after 9/11 under George W. Bush." Cotton’s math is inconsistent and stacked against Obama -- and there’s a limit to how fairly a comparison like this reflects what an administration can accomplish in counter-terrorism. On balance, we rate Cotton’s claim Mostly False.	None	Tom Cotton	None	None	None	2013-04-26T17:59:45	2013-04-24	['United_States', 'George_W._Bush', 'Barack_Obama']

pomt-07265	"The (health reform) legislation which Washington passed last year has made it more difficult to hire" because it’s increased costs for employers.	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/may/26/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-says-health-care-reform-has-hamper/	Congress passed a health care bill last year with twin goals of insuring more Americans while putting the brakes on runaway medical spending. We’ll see if those goals are achieved sometime after 2014 when the main provisions take effect. Until then, all we have are projections. Sen. Rob Portman, however, focused recently on the here and now. Even before the big provisions kick in that will expand health coverage to nearly all Americans, Portman says he is hearing from employers that their premiums are rising because of the law, called the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. And those rising costs are making it harder for them to hire new employees, he says. "The legislation which Washington passed last year has made it more difficult to hire because it’s increased the cost of hiring someone," Portman told reporters on May 3, when he unveiled a "Jobs Plan" that included a proposed rollback of the health law. A few days later, Portman said small businesses have told him health care reform is already driving up their costs. "People are telling me 15- and 16-percent premium increases," he said. Some provisions of the health care law did take effect last fall and early this year. Employers now must enroll employees’ dependent children, if the parents wish to add them, until they are 26 years old. New policies must pay for preventive care without tapping the employee’s deductible. And health plans cannot cap the lifetime value of medical care they will cover. Each of these might seem like it would make insurance premiums jump. "It’s a basic principle of economics: If you add more things, it will cost more," said Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for America’s Health Insurance Plans, the health insurance lobby. Yet conservative business groups and liberal advocates alike say that generally, those increases have been small. Adding a 24-year-old to your health coverage might require you to get a family plan if you only have individual or spousal coverage, so your employer would have a higher cost if it pays for part of your insurance. But young adults typically don’t use a lot of medical services and have very low health care costs. Similarly, full coverage of preventive care is only required for new policies. As for the lifting of lifetime limits on what a plan will pay, Bill Robertson, president of the Concord Benefit Planning Agency, a benefits consultant from Lake County, near Cleveland, told us that rarely happens now since the caps tend to be a $1 million or more. "I’ve been in business 36 years," he said. "I have cumulatively insured 50,000 people. I have seen one claim go above the cap." Altogether, these new requirements added an average of 2.5 percent this year to the cost of employer-provided health insurance, according to modeling by the Lockton Benefits Group, a division of Lockton Cos., a large, privately held insurance brokerage. A study last fall by Mercer, an international consulting firm, put the average cost increase attributable to the immediate changes at 2.3 percent, with small companies (under 500 workers) averaging 3 percent and large companies (5,000 or more workers) 1.9 percent. Finally, the Ohio Department of Insurance, which regulates insurers and must approve many rate hikes, says premiums have risen about 15 percent, but only 2 to 3 percent is due to requirements of the Affordable Care Act. We asked Portman to elaborate on his claim. He mentioned a Congressional Budget Office study that, he said, predicted 800,000 fewer people in jobs as a result of the health care legislation. That’s after 2014, however, and the study did not actually state this number of jobs. Instead, congressional Republicans extrapolated the number -- variously cited as 650,000 or 800,000 -- during a hearing in which the CBO director was testifying. Separate analyses by PolitFact,FactCheck.org, and The Washington Post all found problems with the GOP’s interpretation. The CBO never said these jobs would be lost due to higher cost for employers. Rather, the CBO discussed a small reduction in the amount of labor in the economy, some of which would be caused by people leaving the workforce because they will no longer need to hold onto a job just to maintain their health insurance. PolitiFact ruled that a claim nearly identical to Portman’s, based on the CBO report, was False. Portman, however, told us that he based his claim on more than the CBO study. As he has said several times recently, this is what Ohio business owners are telling him. He provided us with names. Fredon Corp., a family-owned precision machining company in Mentor, has 78 employees and avoided layoffs during the economic downturn, said Alyson Scott, the chief financial officer. Now it plans to start hiring. Rising health insurance costs do make hiring a bigger challenge, she said. "It absolutely goes to your overall expenses," she said. The company used to face annual premium hikes of about 10 percent -- increases the insurance industry attributed to inflation, an aging population and high use of medical services by all Americans. But Fredon was quoted a 22.6 percent hike for this year for the same Medical Mutual of Ohio coverage that it had in 2010. "They said they have no idea what’s going to happen in the future and they have to cover their costs," Scott said. Fredon’s insurance broker, Lisa Dimberio Nelson of Right Track Benefits, negotiated the increase down to 15 percent, said Scott, whose account was confirmed by Nelson. "What the carriers are telling us," Nelson said, "is that it’s the mandates." They say "it’s not our fault, it’s the mandates," she said. Yet Fredon plans to expand its workforce anyway. So did higher premiums really have an effect? Absolutely, said Scott. It won’t prevent hiring, but it has caused the company to reassess "how much we’re hiring, and at what stage." We contacted Medical Mutual and asked about rate hikes necessary to cover the mandates of the Affordable Care Act. "At this point, health care reform has had a minimal impact on pricing and it is too early to determine the future impact as the major provisions of the legislation do not take effect for nearly three more years," said Ed Byers, Medical Mutual’s spokesman. He was at a loss to explain why Fredon and its broker had the clear impression that a big part of its increase was due to health reform mandates. Portman’s office recommended other companies to us, too. Three of them agreed to interviews: PR Machine Works in Mansfield, Mound Laser in Miamisburg, and Rebsco Inc. in Greenville. Zoi Romanchuk, vice president of PR Machine Works, said premiums rose just 3 percent this year at her 55-employee company, but she expects a big increase next year. The company saw a 30 percent increase in 2009, which predates health reform. She said that other companies tell her they got hit with 30 percent and 40 percent hikes this year. Has this effected hiring at her company? "Not yet," she said. Mound Laser President and CEO Larry Dosser said premiums rose 20 percent this year, after experiencing premium increases in the low single digits for his 30-employee company. The company used to pay 100 percent of its workers’ policy costs but dropped its share to 90 percent, Dosser said. Ninety percent of Mound Laser’s work involves making microscopic parts for manufacturers in the medical device industry, which will face a special tax starting in 2013 to help offset health reform’s costs. The White House says the tax won’t hurt because the medical device industry will prosper from new patients gaining health insurance, but Dosser fears it could force his customers to move overseas, impacting his business. So is Mound Laser slowing its hiring? Not at all, Dosser said. It plans to grow to about 50 employees by the end of the year, "because I refuse to be dictated to by those kinds of policies." Then there’s Rebsco, a metal fabrication design and manufacturing company. It faced a 23 percent premium hike for insurance on its 20 employees, but held it down to 10 percent to 12 percent by raising the deductible. That means that workers, too, got hit with higher out-of-pocket costs, according to Tyeis Baker-Baumann, the company’s president. Has it affected hiring? It has in the sense that every new expense hurts, Baumann said. Her company could use two or three more workers, but "we’re not going to (hire) at this point," she said. "We’ll put that discussion off for as long as possible." Why are employers under the impression that health care reform is to blame for double-figure rate hikes? Gary Claxton, vice president of the nonprofit, nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation and an authority on the insurance marketplace, offered this theory: "If you were an insurer and you wanted to blame someone else, wouldn’t you blame the government?" So how do we assess Portman’s statement? We have the CBO report, which would point toward a rating of False. We have assessments from the insurance industry and regulators, which put the premium increases attributable to the new law around 2.5 percent. And we have the companies Portman cited. Fredon Corp. says it has not cut hiring, but is reassessing how much. Its insurer insists health care reform has had a minimal impact on pricing. PR Machine Works is still hiring. Mound Laser is not slowing its hiring because that would be a capitulation. And Rebsco will delay new hiring because every new cost hurts -- including insurance. After looking at considerable amounts of data and studies, talking with industry and association experts and phoning people who run small companies, we found that Portman’s statement had some elements of truth. But there were too many critical facts pointing the other direction, too many misleading or confused assumptions about the cause of double-digit premium hikes -- and too few actual lost jobs or slowdowns attributable to health reform -- for the Truth-O-Meter to point in any other direction than Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09464	Cover Florida "is available to any Floridian, offering basic coverage for about $150 a month, instead of the typical $600 a month."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/mar/03/charlie-crist/crist-says-cover-florida-offers-basic-health-cover/	In his State of the State address, Gov. Charlie Crist cited a litany of accomplishments. Among them: Cover Florida, a state-backed health insurance plan designed to make coverage available to uninsured residents. "This program is available to almost any Floridian, offering basic coverage for about $150 a month, instead of the typical $600 a month," he said. "As with any private sector plan, the more extensive coverage you want, the higher the premiums, but with so many lacking basic preventive care, Cover Florida remains a sound option for thousands of Floridians." When we checked a similar claim from Crist in October, Crist said it usually costs $900 to get health insurance. That earned a False ruling because he was comparing apples and oranges. His claim is different this time, and so is the produce-aisle metaphor we're using to describe his technique: He's cherry-picking. First, some background. Launched in 2008, Cover Florida allows people without coverage for at least six months to pick from plans offered by six insurance companies. The state selected each provider through a competitive bidding process. The provider offers at least two options — one with catastrophic and hospital coverage, and another plan that can provide less coverage. The program's Web site says that the statewide individual plans can be purchased for as little as $23 a month, to as much as $500 a month, depending on age, gender and level of coverage. Patients pick and choose between various options offered through the insurers. So, for example, a woman who is between 19 and 29 years of age can pay $130 a month for a plan that includes no deductible, $10 copays for doctor visits, but no hospital inpatient coverage. Critics contend Cover Florida Health Care hasn't done enough to cover the uninsured. As of Dec. 31, 2009, about 5,400 people have enrolled — about 0.1 percent of the state's uninsured population, which Crist put at 3.8 million in his speech. But in his speech, Crist avoided those numbers and focused instead on the price. Let's examine both numbers he used. First, Crist avoided the apples and oranges mistake he made last time, in which he compared a number for family coverage with a number for individuals. But he stretched the truth in other ways. He said basic coverage is available for about $150 a month. But we find that he's chosen a low number from the wide menu of options to give himself a favorable comparison. When people think about health insurance they probably think of coverage that includes hospitalization. And the two statewide Cover Florida plans that offer that coverage are Blue Cross Blue Shield -- average cost $148 for a single -- and United Healthcare, which averages $327. It's also worth noting that is for very basic coverage that includes higher deductibles than you might typically get for a traditional health plan from your employer. The other part of Crist's claim is that the typical price for coverage for an individual is $600 a month. But we checked that against numbers from the Kaiser Family Foundation, which Crist's office had cited when we checked his earlier claim, and found he's way off. A 2009 Kaiser study says the average monthly cost for a single plan from an employer is $402. (On average, Kaiser found that employers pay 83 percent of an individual's cost, leaving workers to pay about $68). A study by eHealth, which offers coverage to people on the individual market when they cannot get employer coverage, said the average monthly cost is $161. That number is lower than the employer-provided cost because the policies typically have higher deductibles or fewer benefits. Also, insurers in the individual market can deny coverage for pre-existing conditions. So Crist's overall point has some truth to it -- you can get basic coverage for $150. But he's doing some artful cherry-picking. He chose the lowest average rate for Cover Florida ($150, when the other plan costs $327) and a very high number for the private market ($600, when studies show it would cost more in the range of $160-$400.) That's such a significant difference that we find his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2010-03-03T18:29:44	2010-03-02	['Florida']

pomt-05577	The Florida Department of Agriculture’s website FreshFromFlorida.com can be used "to get a permit to carry a loaded hidden gun without ever leaving your house."	false	/florida/statements/2012/apr/03/brady-campaign-prevent-gun-violence/can-you-get-gun-florida-without-ever-leaving-your-/	Obtaining a permit to carry a concealed gun in Florida is so easy that Floridians can do it without leaving the comfort of their own homes, according to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. Dan Gross, the president of the group, testified about Florida’s gun laws at a briefing held with some congressional Democrats March 27. The topic was racial profiling and "stand your ground" laws in the wake of the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin. Martin, an unarmed black teenager from Miami Gardens, was shot and killed by a white neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla. The volunteer, George Zimmerman, has not been arrested, and that has spurred debate of Florida’s "stand your ground" gun law. The Brady Campaign says Florida has become a "great success story" for the gun lobby. "In Florida, being armed in public is such a casual formality that law enforcement does not issue the license to carry loaded, concealed guns; that is done by the Department of Agriculture – the same agency charged with issuing permits to pick tomatoes or transport livestock," Gross said. "Their website is FreshFromFlorida.com. You can use it to get a permit to carry a loaded hidden gun without ever leaving your house," he added. Gross made it sound incredibly easy to obtain a concealed weapons permit. Can Floridians simply log on to FreshFromFlorida.com and obtain a weapons permit without getting off the couch? We decided to investigate. Requirements for a concealed weapons permit in Florida The Brady Campaign is right that it is the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services that issues concealed weapons permits. It was easy to download the two-page application and about 45 pages containing the application instructions and the law. But the process is much more complicated than just filling out an online form. Candidates must provide a photograph, pay a fee and have their application form notarized. Most significantly for purposes of this fact-check, applicants must show proof of having gone through a firearms training class, and they must be fingerprinted. (Out-of-state applicants don’t have to come to Florida but must follow the same guidelines, including getting fingerprinted by law enforcement.) We thought those two requirements showed the Brady Campaign was wrong in its statement. The Brady Campaign, though, responded to our questions and argued that even these two criteria could be done from home. So let’s review the evidence. • Firearms training documentation: Florida law states in 790.06(2)(h) that an instructor "must maintain records certifying that he or she observed the student safely handle and discharge the firearm." That can be a class taught by law enforcement, the National Rifle Association, or any other class approved by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. So that rules out an online course, said Sterling Ivey, spokeman for the agriculture department. But the Brady Campaign responded that some certified instructors will come to your home, pointing us to groups like Florida Concealed Weapons Carry. Its website states: "We will come to your location and provide a shooting trailer anywhere within an hour and a half radius from Starke, Fla. We provide all materials, concealed weapons pictures, and notary on the spot." We spoke to the owner of that company, Eric Wall. "When I go to their house we usually have it in their living room or whatever to go over the details of concealed carry," he said. Then the applicants head to his trailer, which is a mobile shooting range. "I have to physically watch everyone handle, load and shoot a firearm." Worried the neighbors might complain about your participation in a mobile firearm class in your driveway? The trailer is soundproof, said Wall. He’s even done training at dentists’ and doctors' offices, he said. (We should note that going into the trailer means you need to leave your house, even though you're still on your own property.) Wall said he can take care of the firearms class, photo and notary all at an applicant's home. Typically, Wall trains small groups and charges $50 per person, but it depends on the distance he has to travel. We also spoke to Irving Gelbart, a retired Miami-Dade police lieutenant who teaches mobile classes through his company, Pentagon Defense Products and Training Alliance. Gelbart said he will do the class work in someone’s home but prefers a range for the shooting portion. The Brady Campaign also noted that applicants can use past shooting experience, pointing to language on the application that says acceptable documentation includes "evidence of experience with a firearm obtained through participation in organized shooting competition." Ivey said a mobile firearm class is allowed, as long as it meets the requirements of having the instructor observe the student safely handle the firearm. He also said that past shooting experience is acceptable, but that would likely have meant the person left their home. • A set of fingerprints or a copy of a receipt showing that they had a scan of their fingerprints: Florida’s application states that "fingerprints must be taken at a LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY’’ and the statute requires "a full set of fingerprints of the applicant administered by a law enforcement agency. We thought this element definitely contradicted the Brady Campaign’s statement, but spokeswoman Caroline Brewer said not so fast. "Our statement was discussing the application form that is downloadable from the Florida website, which the context makes clear," she said via email. "However, even if you read our statement as applying to the separate fingerprint card sent by mail and not downloadable, yes, there are many fingerprinting services that say they will come to your home to take your fingerprints, some of which even say that they are done under the authority of law enforcement and valid for Florida." The Brady Campaign pointed us to several mobile fingerprinting services. These services do exist, but we could not find a mobile company that would provide this service at Floridians’ homes. We spoke to owners at three mobile fingerprint companies in Florida -- 1 SureScan in Orlando, Anytime Mobile Fingerprinting in the Tampa area and Fingerprint Technologies in Coral Gables -- who told us that they had inquired with FDLE about providing that service and had been discouraged or told it wasn’t allowed. We asked FDLE if they would accept fingerprints from a mobile company for the concealed weapons permit. FDLE spokesman Keith Kameg replied: "It is our understanding that FL Statute 790.06 (4)(c) states that fingerprinting is to be administered by a law enforcement agency. FDLE performs the background checks and provides the results to Department of Agriculture." Possible -- but common? Clearly, many applicants handle at least part of the application process from home: Since July 2011, about 45,000 used the agriculture department’s regional offices while 89,000 mailed them in from elsewhere. And it is possible to download the permit from FreshFromFlorida.com, hire a mobile firearm instructor/notary/photographer, and mail in the application from home. There is no way to know how many applicants -- if any -- have done that. Several experts on Florida’s permitting process said either that they had never heard of mobile firearms training or that it was a rarity. The part of the Brady Campaign's claim that seems to fall short is about fingerprints: We could not find any indication that applicants in Florida could summon mobile fingerprinters to their homes. Our ruling Dan Gross, the president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said that at the Florida Department of Agriculture’s website FreshFromFlorida.com, people can "get a permit to carry a loaded hidden gun without ever leaving your house." The Brady Campaign argued that their claim referred to the application itself. But fingerprints are required as part of the application process, and Gross made no such distinction in his statement. We think his overall message was clear: He was trying to convey that it’s so easy to get a gun permit that you can do it from home. The law, though, requires that people receive firearms training and be fingerprinted by law enforcement, two elements that would typically require people to leave their homes. While it’s possible to pay a firearms trainer to come to your property, we found no evidence that such training is widespread. We also found no evidence that mobile fingerprinting would be allowed for the gun permit application in the state of Florida. We rate this claim False.

pomt-02725	Gov. Scott Walker bought "80 new, brand-new vehicles" for the state that "we probably don’t need."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/dec/20/kathleen-vinehout/casting-scott-walker-spender-democrat-says-walker-/	Criss-crossing Wisconsin to scope out a possible campaign for governor, state Sen. Kathleen Vinehout depicts Gov. Scott Walker as a spender and borrower, saying she would not have grown the state budget the way he has in his first term. In terms of spending, the Alma Democrat said at a suburban Milwaukee home on Dec. 5, 2013 she would "get rid of some things that we probably don't really need," according to a video of part of the meeting. "Like, I like to pick on the 80 new, brand-new vehicles that the governor bought," she told the group. "We probably don't need 80 new, brand-new vehicles. So, get rid of that." By emphasizing "brand new," Vinehout suggests the vehicle purchases are unnecessary or excessive. So let’s peek into the garage. The backdrop Vinehout made her claim in tandem with two statements critical of Walker’s budgeting. In saying the governor’s 2013-’15 budget "spends $4 billion more" than his 2011-’13 budget, Vinehout made a claim similar to one made by Democrat Mary Burke, the only announced candidate for governor in 2014. We rated Burke’s statement, that the state budget had grown $4.6 billion under Walker, as Half True. The figure was accurate, but the increase is due almost completely to Medicaid costs, not budget decisions Walker made. Vinehout also said Walker’s two budgets led to a record percentage of state tax money being spent on debt payments. That also earned a Half True. The 5.26 percent of general fund revenue is the highest on record, but it reached that level because of the borrowing and debt restructuring done by previous governors, as well as by Walker. The vehicles Vinehout is recovering from surgery for a fractured arm she suffered in a car accident on Dec. 8, 2013 and was unavailable to comment. Her chief of staff, Linda Kleinschmidt, cited an appropriation in Walker's 2013-’15 budget, but said she did not know why Vinehout singled it out for criticism. The appropriation is for $1.14 million in 2013-’14, an increase of 15 percent over the previous year, and the same amount in 2014-’15, for a total of $2.28 million. The vehicles would be for Central Fleet, which is overseen by Walker's Department of Administration and manages about 1,500 of the state’s vehicles. The budget authorizes purchasing a total of 80 vehicles, but more specifically calls for adding 38 vehicles in 2013-’14 and 38 more the next year, for a total of 76. As of mid-December 2013 no vehicles had yet been purchased but planning is underway, according to Stephanie Marquis, spokeswoman for the Department of Administration. So, Walker’s budget authorizes the purchase of 80 vehicles, but to this point, he hasn’t bought any. The rationale Walker spokesman Tom Evenson said the purchases are aimed at saving money. He cited another budget document from the fiscal bureau. That memo says the Walker administration believes owning more vehicles will mean spending less on leasing vehicles and less on reimbursing state employees for work use of their personal cars. For example, the administration says the state-owned vehicles cost an average of 35 cents per mile to operate, while the per-mile state reimbursement rate to employees is 51 cents. All told, the Walker administration estimates the state will save $563,700 over the two-year budget if 76 vehicles are purchased. So, the purchases aren’t simply adding spending but rather are aimed at saving money in the long run. Our rating Vinehout said Walker bought "80 new, brand-new vehicles" for the state that "we probably don’t need." Walker did add money to the state budget to buy roughly 80 more vehicles. But he hasn’t bought any yet and, despite Vinehout’s characterization of the purchases being an unnecessary expense, they are aimed at saving money. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression -- our definition of Mostly False.

pomt-09028	"As Washington debates cracking down on the big Wall Street banks, I’ve passed legislation that does so."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/jul/07/david-segal/segal-says-he-passed-laws-cracking-down-wall-stree/	Like many candidates in this midterm election, state Rep. David Segal, one of four Democrats running for Congress in the 1st District, has pledged to fight for families and stand up to corporate interests. On his website, he takes that promise a step further: "Together, we’ve won some important victories. As Washington debates cracking down on the big Wall Street banks, I’ve passed legislation that does so. Working hand-in-hand with the grassroots, I pushed into law bills that crack down on the big banks’ foreclosures and predatory lending." What big Wall Street banks was he muscling in Rhode Island? We decided to ask him. Segal says the statement refers to two pieces of legislation he helped pass. The first was a 2006 ordinance targeting predatory lending that he sponsored while serving as a member of the Providence City Council. The bill forbids Providence to deposit city funds with so-called predatory lenders. The ordinance did little to stop the foreclosure storm headed for Rhode Island. But it’s true that Segal and the council took steps to address the problem more than two years before it reached crisis stage. The second piece of legislation Segal cited is a 2009 bill he sponsored as a state representative. The version that ultimately passed requires lenders to notify borrowers at least 45 days before a foreclosure action. The written notice must advise the borrower of the availability of free counseling through mortgage counselors approved by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Segal says his sponsorship of the bill constitutes "cracking down" on the "big Wall Street banks" because lobbyists associated with those banks testified against the proposal in committee hearings. This is where his claim proves to be too bold. Records show that only one person representing large banks testified in opposition at the first hearing on March 31: James Hahn, a Providence lawyer who spoke on behalf of the Rhode Island Mortgage Bankers Association. The House Judiciary Committee did not tape that hearing, leaving no official record. But Hahn said his association -- which lobbies for both very large national banks and very small local ones -- offered lukewarm opposition. Segal contended that the second hearing, on October 27, was much more heated. The bank lobbyists, he said, strenuously objected to the bill and he angrily stood up to them. That proceeding was recorded. Watch the tape, Segal urged us, you’ll see. So we did. But we saw no one strenuously objecting to anything. In fact, it seemed quite civil. Three banking industry lobbyists testified. All expressed support for Segal’s legislation. Among them, Bill Farrell, the lobbyist for the Rhode Island Bankers Association, testified that he had "no problem with the language that’s in this proposal." Their only objection was that a second compromise provision they’d worked on with Segal and several housing advocates had been pulled at the last second without their knowledge. That measure would have preempted cities and towns from establishing individual municipal foreclosure statutes, something the lobbyists thought would create confusion. Despite what he told us about getting angry that day, Segal himself says little on the tape to oppose their testimony, or to address the preemption issue. But he now says he was responsible for having the municipal provision removed and cites that as proof that he cracked down on "big Wall Street banks." Segal argues that the lobbyists -- and Farrell in particular -- represent those institutions, and says killing a part of the legislation they supported constitutes standing up to Wall Street. Among the banks that Farrell represents is Bank of America, one of the nation’s largest. However the organization also includes small, local banks. Brenda Clement, executive director of the Housing Action Coalition of Rhode Island, made a point during the hearing of suggesting that most of Farrell’s clients are not Wall Street giants. "Mr. Farrell represents the Rhode Island Bankers Association who are in general not the problem in the foreclosure issue. Their membership [is] banks here in our community and they are working with us all the time," she said. The General Assembly went on to approve that legislation which Governor Carcieri then vetoed. When legislators returned in January, they overrode it. Farrell acknowledges that he asked Carcieri to veto the bill because it did not include the municipal preemption piece that legislators had promised. Given all that, does Segal’s sponsorship constitute a cracking down on "big Wall Street banks"? We understand that the banks he talks about played a major role in the mortgage crisis. But we see little evidence that Segal’s actions did anything to really crack down on those institutions. Requiring any bank -- Wall Street or Main Street -- to send a 45-day notification letter hardly equates to cracking down on them. Segal maintains that he sees no difference between fighting against foreclosures and "cracking down" on these companies. But words matter and his don’t reflect what he accomplished. Lastly, there is the issue of the language in Segal’s statement. Despite his phrasing, he did not pass this legislation himself. He sponsored the bill, along with four other representatives, that the legislative leadership then green-lighted for approval. It passed the House in a 48 to 19 vote, a wide enough margin for legislators to later override the veto. To say he passed it implies that he alone did the legwork and that’s just not how the General Assembly works. Segal’s measures in 2006 showed a foresight about a brewing problem and the gumption to try to do something about it. But his actions at the General Assembly in 2009 were nowhere near bold enough to warrant a claim that he cracked down on big Wall Street banks. We’re calling it Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11847	Under the House Republican tax proposal, "the average family of four earning median income ($59,000/year) will receive an additional $1,182 in their pocket every year."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2017/nov/06/drew-ferguson/georgia-congressman-says-gop-tax-bill-will-save-ty/	House Republicans have touted their tax bill as a plus for typical American families. In a constituent email forwarded to us by a reader, Georgia Rep. Drew Ferguson wrote, "This week the House released our tax reform legislation to help American families and level the playing field for the American worker. With this plan, the average family of four earning median income ($59,000/year) will receive an additional $1,182 in their pocket every year. Who wouldn't want American families to have more money in their pockets?" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The statement is exaggerating how long the average family of four will enjoy those tax savings. How the House Republican math works Ferguson’s office said that he had been citing comment from House Speaker Paul Ryan, whose office told us in a related check that the speaker had been referring to a House Ways and Means Committee analysis. That analysis calculated several scenarios for how the proposal’s changes could affect different types of taxpayers. The key elements of the Ways and Means calculation involved tax brackets, the standard deduction and the child tax credit. Currently, there are seven brackets; these would be consolidated into four -- 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent, and 39.6 percent. In the meantime, the standard deduction would be raised from $12,000 to $24,000. And the child tax credit would be increased from $1,000 to $1,600, bolstered by a new $300 credit for parents and other dependents. The example refers to a "family of four making $59,000 per year." Here’s the scenario outlined in the House’s fact sheet, using the fictional example of "Steve and Melinda" with two middle school-aged children: "As a result of lower tax rates, a significantly larger standard deduction, and an enhanced Child Tax Credit and Family Flexibility Credit, Steve and Melinda will pay over $1,182 less in taxes than last year, reducing their total tax bill from $1,582 to only $400. "That’s more money they can use for whatever is important to them, whether it’s paying bills, purchasing a new refrigerator, or putting away savings for the future." The Ways and Means Committee told PolitiFact that they chose a household income of $59,000 because it’s the median household income nationally. For that amount of income, a family today would get $12,700 from the standard deduction, $16,200 in personal exemptions, leaving $30,100 in taxable income. Of that, $18,650 would be taxed at 10 percent and $11,450 would be taxed at 15 percent, meaning the preliminary tax liability would be $3,582.50. That would be adjusted with $2,000 in child tax credits, producing a final tax liability of $1,582.50. Under the new tax bill, the family would take a larger $24,000 standard deduction (the proposal eliminates personal exemptions), leaving $35,000 in taxable income. At the 12 percent rate, that would mean $4,200 in preliminary liability. This would be offset by $3,200 in child tax credits and $600 in family credits, leaving a final tax liability of $400. That’s a $1,182.50 tax cut. So Ferguson has some mathematical detail to back up the figure. But that’s not the end of the story. Here are the two clearest caveats. Reduction of itemized deductions The GOP bill eliminates or shrinks a number of widely used itemized deductions, and those factors aren’t taken into account in the figure Ryan cited. The deductions eliminated or pared back in the bill include the mortgage interest deduction (for future mortgages, it would be capped at half its previous maximum); the state and local tax deduction (only $10,000 in property tax deductions would be allowed); the medical expense deduction; the casualty loss deduction; and the student loan interest deduction. Exchanging these changes for a higher standard deduction may benefit many taxpayers, particularly those who choose not to itemize today. For households earning around $59,000 a year, more taxpayers do take the standard deduction than take itemized deductions -- but a significant minority, about one-third, do itemize. For many itemizing taxpayers, those deductions are important -- and under the tax bill, they’re likely to end up worse off if the bill is passed as is, even with the higher standard deduction. For this type of taxpayer, the loss of even one of those deductions could conceivably wipe out that $1,182 gain for certain types of families. This specific amount of tax savings is good for just the first year Ferguson’s statement explicitly said that the $1,182 income boost would happen "every year." The problem is that the benefits of the tax proposal shrink, slowly but surely, over the next decade for this family. "The tax cut definitely dissipates over time," David Kamin, a tax and budget specialist at the New York University law school, told PolitiFact. Kamin cited a combination of factors, including the sunsetting of the $300 per parent tax credit; the lack of inflation adjustments for the child tax credit, which effectively replace personal exemptions that were indexed to inflation; and the new use of an inflation adjustment measure known as chained CPI, which grows more slowly than the yardstick in current use. According to Kamin’s calculations, the initial tax cut for the family making $59,000 becomes a $500 tax increase by 2024 compared to the status quo. Here’s the graph he put together: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com The way Ferguson described the cut was actually stronger than Ryan’s tax cut of "$1,182 a year." Amy Timmerman, Ferguson’s communications director, said that "the congressman misspoke last week when he cited Speaker Ryan’s example." Our ruling Ferguson said that under the House Republican tax proposal, "the average family of four earning median income ($59,000/year) will receive an additional $1,182 in their pocket every year." This is based on a plausible and transparent calculation, but Ferguson glossed over some context. The calculation doesn’t factor in several itemized deductions that would disappear under the proposal and that could have a significant impact on at least some "typical" families around that income level. And the statement is misleading when it says the family will save $1,182 "every year," since that’s the case in the first year only; after that, the benefit starts to shrink and eventually turns into a tax hike. We rate the statement Half True. EDITORS' NOTE, Nov. 6, 2017: We updated this story to remove a reference to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center of the tax plan. That plan is now under review by TPC and the organization asked journalists to refrain from quoting the report until it is revised.

pomt-04762	Says a portfolio managed by the Texas General Land Office earned 22 percent last year while the state’s emergency reserve account experienced a 1 percent gain.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/aug/28/jerry-patterson/jerry-patterson-says-investments-overseen-his-offi/	Criticizing a poke at his not releasing millions of dollars to support public schools, Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson said that doing so might cut into double-digit returns on investments managed by the General Land Office. In a letter he made public Aug. 22, 2012, Patterson, a Republican, said that those who want him to transfer $300 million in investment earnings to the State Board of Education for school needs do not understand the value of keeping such money invested so the state’s education endowment, the Permanent School Fund, continues to gain value. A pro-Democratic group, Progress Texas, accuses Patterson of inappropriately hoarding the millions. Patterson counters that the School Land Board, which he chairs, has discretion over whether to transfer the money and, he told us by telephone, it has until September 2013 to decide. His spokesman, Jim Suydam, also told us by email that the board approved a resolution in early 2011 to release $250 million of earnings in both 2012 and 2013 to the State Board of Education. In his letter, Patterson said that draining off additional earnings as Progress Texas says he must is a "bad choice... because last year the GLO-managed PSF earned 22 percent and, due to statutory liquidity requirements, the rainy day fund earned just 1 percent." He was comparing the portion of the Permanent School Fund managed by the land office to earnings on the state’s savings account, otherwise known as the Economic Stabilization Fund. "If your family needed a quick infusion of cash," Patterson wrote, "would you withdraw cash from the investment account earning 22 percent or the account earning 1 percent?" We’re not venturing that question, but wondered if Patterson made an accurate earnings comparison. Starting in 2005, the land office was given the authority to invest in real estate using proceeds received from selling lands or drawing on revenue from Permanent School Fund mineral leases and royalties, the agency notes on a web page. Professional fund management firms oversee the investments, the agency says, while the land board, consisting of the commissioner and two citizen appointees, manages the sale of Permanent School Fund land and mineral leases. To our inquiry, Suydam provided an agency report to the Legislature stating that through March 2012, the market value of the agency’s investments made from the Permanent School Fund was $3.077 billion, about half of that reflecting "externally managed direct real estate investments" and nearly $1.2 billion "attributable to short-term investments" in the state’s treasury, which Suydam later said means money set aside so it’s on call for the agency’s real estate investments. The report, dated Sept. 1, 2012, says that gross "time-weighted" returns on the portfolio in the 12 months through March amounted to nearly 22.9 percent, though that is without considering the short-term investments. Counting the cash-on-call portion, the report says, the time-weighted returns on the portfolio were 13.03 percent. "Time-weighted" returns? By email, Suydam told us the term describes a "complex calculation that uses values for every day in the period being measured" which, he said, explains why the 23 percent return shown for the real estate investments does not align with the 30 percent return that we calculated by comparing the market value of those investments at the end of March 2012 to the comparable figure at the end of March 2011. Asked how the earnings on real estate through March 2012 compare to recent 12-month periods, Suydam said such investments generated nearly 14 percent in market value in the 12 months through March 2011, but lost about 15 percent in the 12 months through March 2010. We checked on the rainy day fund’s earnings with Lauren Willis, spokeswoman for State Comptroller Susan Combs, who oversees state finances. Willis said by email that money in the reserve fund, created in 1988, is invested like other funds in the state’s treasury in stable, high-quality investments. In 2011, Willis said, the average yield on all those funds was 0.74 percent -- generating nearly $194 million in interest income including $51.9 million added to the rainy day fund. R.J. DeSilva, another Combs spokesman, said by email the rate of return might or might not have been about the same through the 12 months running through March 2012. In a telephone interview, we asked Patterson about why his letter mentions the higher returns on the real estate investments alone rather than also taking into account the lower returns influenced by the agency’s cash-on-call funds. "I don’t count the cash," Patterson replied, "because it’s not part of our investment portfolio." The land office, Patterson noted, is limited by law to managing just part of the overall education endowment. Suydam later said by email that as of the end of March, the market value of the agency’s portion of the PSF, not including the value of minerals or state-owned land, was nearly $3.1 billion. He said the State Board of Education oversaw the fund’s remaining $25.6 billion. Our ruling Patterson’s reference to 22 percent in earnings over the 12 months running through March 2012 does not account for reduced earnings from nearly $1.2 billion in cash-on-call money supporting the agency’s real estate investments. That clarification would be helpful, though it still seems reasonable, overall, to focus on the portion of the portfolio that would be expected to reap sizable gains. Separately, the claim seems to reflect the annual earnings on the rainy day fund, though the commissioner’s March-to-March time period does not match the calendar-year approach used by the state comptroller.

The e-mail asserts that Clinton and Obama want to raise capital gains taxes and dividends taxes, as well as raise tax rates for all income levels. We'll look at dividends taxes here. Dividends are payments that companies make to stockholders as a way of distributing profits. Before the Bush administration, dividends were taxed like normal income, with the rate for the wealthiest taxpayers reaching 39.6 percent. President Bush cut the tax rates on dividends to 15 percent, the same as capital gains taxes. Obama has said he will let the dividends tax cut expire so that dividends will be taxed at the same rate as normal income. We can't find an example of Clinton directly addressing the dividends tax, but she has spoken repeatedly about letting the Bush tax cuts expire for higher income taxpayers. Her campaign didn't respond to our questions. Here's what the e-mail states: "DIVIDEND TAX MCCAIN 15% (no change) OBAMA 39.6% CLINTON 39.6%" "How will this affect you?" the e-mail asks. "If you have any money invested in stock market, IRA, mutual funds, college funds, life insurance, retirement accounts, or anything that pays or reinvests dividends, you will now be paying nearly 40% of the money earned on taxes if Obama or Clinton become president. The experts predict that 'Higher tax rates on dividends and capital gains would crash the stock market yet do absolutely nothing to cut the deficit.'" The e-mail's explanation gets a few things wrong. Only taxpayers in the top bracket would pay 39.6 percent on dividends taxes. It's also unlikely that an increase in dividends taxes would crash the stockmarket. "That's hyperbolic," said William Ahern, a spokesman for the Tax Foundation, a progrowth tax policy think tank that opposes increases in dividends taxes. Another tax policy expert also shot down the stock-market-crash scenario: "Raising the dividend tax could cause some high income U.S. investors to move some of their wealth out of stocks, but all the analyses I have seen suggested the effect on the stock market would be small and would be swamped by changes in stock prices due to other causes," said Eric Toder, a tax policy expert with the Urban Institute. We find the e-mail gets its summary of the dividends tax only partially correct, though it is right that Obama specifically proposes an increase on the tax and Clinton has indicated she wants to let the Bush tax cuts expire for higher-income taxpayers. But Clinton hasn't staked out a specific change on the dividends tax and it's misleading for the e-mail to use one. And, the e-mail is wrong to suggest a change in the dividends tax would cause the stock market to crash. We rate its claims Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-15296	If women seeking an abortion see their ultrasound, "the odds are pretty high they're going to keep the baby."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jul/22/scott-walker/if-they-see-their-ultrasound-most-women-seeking-ab/	Two days after Gov. Scott Walker announced for president, conservative commentator Laura Ingraham wanted to know if the Wisconsin Republican planned to mislead voters. Interviewing the governor July 15, 2015 on her nationally syndicated radio show, Ingraham referred to a National Journal article that was published on the eve of Walker’s announcement. An anonymous longtime Walker adviser had said Walker would run as a conservative early in the campaign, then position himself as more moderate. "Is that what you’re going to do?" Ingraham asked. "Move to the middle after arguing that you’re the real conservative in this race?" Walker said no, and then went on to list a number of his accomplishments as governor that are important to conservatives. One is a law that requires women seeking an abortion to first get an ultrasound -- although they are not required to view it. "We know if people can see that unborn child, particularly with the latest technology, the odds are pretty high they’re going to keep the baby," Walker said. Do most women seeking an abortion change their mind after seeing their ultrasound scan? Previous fact check We’ve previously reviewed a claim similar to Walker’s. A couple of weeks before Walker signed the ultrasound requirement law in July 2013, conservative pundit Rachel Campos-Duffy, the wife of U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., said "upwards of 90 percent" of women seeking an abortion decide not to have an abortion after seeing an ultrasound. We rated her statement False. One anti-abortion organization claimed a figure of nearly 90 percent for its ultrasound program among a certain group of women. But there was no solid evidence to back Campos-Duffy’s claim, which was more sweeping than Walker’s. Evidence backing Walker Walker’s campaign cited two pieces of evidence that have surfaced since our Campos-Duffy fact check. 1. Anti-abortion group The first is a short news release issued in March 2015 by the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, which describes itself as a "national legal network of prolife pregnancy centers." The release described a survey that the group said it did of some of its centers. According to the release, 410 of the group’s 1,050 centers that offer ultrasounds responded to the survey. And in 75,318 cases in 2013 in which ultrasounds were given -- to what the group labeled as "abortion-minded" or "abortion-vulnerable" women -- 78 percent of the women decided against having an abortion. The release did not say whether there was follow-up to see if the women gave birth, which is what Walker claims. And like much of the evidence we reviewed in the Campos-Duffy fact check this evidence is self-reported by a group that actively advocates against abortion. 2. Academic study Walker’s campaign also cited an academic study published in January 2014 in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology. The researchers reviewed medical records for 15,575 visits by women seeking abortion care at Planned Parenthood clinics in Los Angeles in 2011. Among women who viewed their ultrasound images, over 98.4 percent of the pregnancies were terminated. But Walker’s campaign highlighted a narrower finding of the study. Some 93 percent of the women had entered the clinic expressing what the researchers characterized as a high degree of certainty that they wanted an abortion. Among the 7 percent who expressed medium or low certainty about their decision, viewing the ultrasound "was significantly associated with deciding to continue the pregnancy." But, clearly, that involves a small percentage of the women in the study. Two experts We spoke with one of the authors of the study, University of California at San Francisco School of Medicine professor Katrina Kimport; and with Michele Chadwick, executive director of the anti-abortion ICU Mobile, which is based in Akron, Ohio. They agreed on two points: 1. Neither had seen any peer-reviewed academic research to back Walker’s claim. 2. For some women, particularly those less sure about having an abortion, viewing an ultrasound can be one factor in deciding to continue a pregnancy. And often that decision to continue is not made simply as a result of viewing the ultrasound, but because counseling and other services are provided in addition to the scan. Kimport added that research shows the most common reason women state for getting an abortion is not being able to afford caring for a child, and viewing an ultrasound wouldn’t change that circumstance. Our rating Walker said that if women seeking an abortion see their ultrasound, "the odds are pretty high they're going to keep the baby." There is some evidence that some women considering an abortion opt to continue the pregnancy after seeing their ultrasound, although experts said that decision is typically based on counseling or other services that are offered along with the ultrasound. Meanwhile, the latest academic study we found shows that nearly all women who are more certain about their decision proceed with an abortion even after seeing the ultrasound. And we found no independent studies to back Walker’s statement. For a claim that has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-12822	Says "President Trump makes English the official language of the United States!"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/feb/09/blog-posting/donald-trump-did-not-make-english-official-languag/	A headline on an article posted on several websites falsely declares that President Donald Trump has made English the language of the land. "Breaking! President Trump makes English the official language of the United States!" the headline reads. It’s obvious in the story that follows, which discusses changes on the White House website, that something was lost in translation. We first saw the headline on DonaldTrumpPOTUS45.com on Jan. 26, 2017, but it has appeared on other sites in subsequent days. Facebook flagged the story as part of its efforts to combat fake news in user feeds. First off, English may be the de facto language of the United States, but the country has no designated official language. A majority of states do have laws making English their official language, albeit to varying degrees. Trump also did not elevate English in any official capacity, although he has certainly made it clear he would prefer citizens (including fluent Spanish speaker and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush) speak it. "Well, I think that when you get right down to it, we're a nation that speaks English," Trump said at a 2015 news conference. "I think that, while we're in this nation, we should be speaking English." This is a prime example of a certain type of fake news story that spins news of a real event, then slaps a provocative and largely unrelated headline on it in an attempt to draw eyeballs. In this case, the body of the story clearly advocates for adopting English as an official language, and says Trump should do so. But the only news event alluded to is about the official White House website losing its Spanish translation after Trump was inaugurated. The post cites an article from the Los Angeles Times, which points out the translation option had been removed from WhiteHouse.gov on Jan. 20. As of Feb. 9, the Spanish translation of the White House website was still gone. The story making the rounds on the Internet, meanwhile, says Trump purposely directed his administration to remove the translation. Even if that were true — and there’s no solid evidence that’s the case — it’s far from making English the nation’s official language. That would require legislation through Congress, which has been proposed in the past but never became law. This incendiary headline woefully misrepresents the actual event to which it is tied.

pomt-07011	"We have provided at least 16 tax cuts to small businesses."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/07/barack-obama/barack-obama-claims-credit-least-16-tax-cuts-small/	During a July 6, 2011, question-and-answer session on Twitter, President Barack Obama was asked -- in a tweet by House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio -- "After embarking on a record spending binge that left us deeper in debt, where are the jobs?" Part of Obama’s answer is that his administration has worked to aid small businesses in job creation. "We have provided at least 16 tax cuts to small businesses who have needed a lot of help and have been struggling -- including, for example, saying zero capital gains taxes on startups -- because our attitude is we want to encourage new companies, young entrepreneurs, to get out there, start their business, without feeling like if they’re successful in the first couple of years that somehow they have to pay taxes, as opposed to putting that money back into their business." This response echoed a comment we checked a few weeks earlier. In a face-off between the heads of the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee on NBC's Meet the Press on June 11, 2011, the discussion turned to what the government should be doing to accelerate job creation. "I think we need to cut taxes on small businesses," said RNC Chairman Reince Priebus. "Well, that's good," retorted DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., "because we've done that, 17 times." Here’s what we found when we looked at the question of small business tax cuts. When asked for supporting documents, the DNC press office pointed us to a Feb. 25, 2011, posting on the official White House blog titled "Seventeen Small Business Tax Cuts and Counting." The post enumerated 17 small business tax cuts and credits created or extended through legislation signed by Obama. Eight of them were included in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (more commonly known as the economic stimulus bill), the Affordable Care Act (also known as the health care law), and the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act (aka the HIRE Act). Among the cuts were the exclusion of up to 75 percent of capital gains on key small business investments; a tax credit for the cost of health insurance for small business employees and new tax credits for hiring Americans out of work for at least two months. Another eight cuts came via the Small Business Jobs Act, signed by Obama in September of 2010. These included: adding deductions for business cell phone use; creating a new deduction for health care costs for the self-employed; allowing greater deductions for business start-up expenses; eliminating taxes on all capital gains from key small business investments, and raising the small business expense limit to $500,000. Three months later, the president signed a tax bill that raised the expense limit to 100 percent of small business new investments until the end of 2011. It also extended the elimination of capital gains taxes for small business investments through the end of 2012. Here's the full list: From the Recovery Act, HIRE Acts, and Affordable Care Act: 1. A new small business health care tax credit 2. A new tax credit for hiring unemployed workers 3. Bonus depreciation tax incentives to support new investment 4. 75 percent exclusion of small business capital gains 5. Expansion of limits on small business expensing 6. Five-year carryback of net operating losses 7. Reduction of the built-in gains holding period for small businesses from 10 to 7 years to allow small business greater flexibility in their investments 8. Temporary small business estimated tax payment relief to allow small businesses to keep needed cash on hand From the Small Business Jobs Act: 9. Zero capital gains taxes on key investments in small businesses 10. Raising the small business expensing to $500,000 11. An extension of 50 percent bonus depreciation 12. A new deduction for health care expenses for the self-employed 13. Tax relief and simplification for cell phone deductions 14. An increase in the deduction for entrepreneurs’ start-up expenses 15. A five-year carryback of general business credits 16. Limitations on penalties for errors in tax reporting that disproportionately affect small business From the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act: 17. 100 percent expensing Conservative tax specialists don't quibble much with the list, but they did take issue with the context earlier this year when we asked them about the same claim by Wasserman Schultz. "I can't argue with any of these, but it ignores all the proposed and enacted tax hikes on small businesses," said Ryan Ellis, director of tax policy at Americans For Tax Reform, an anti-tax group headed by Grover Norquist. For example, Ellis said, it ignores President Obama's proposal to allow Bush-era individual income tax cuts to expire for those making more than $250,000. "A clear majority of small business profits are earned in households making at least $250,000 per year." Ellis said. "...That's a tax hike on the small business sector." (PolitiFact Virginia addressed a similar claim in this fact-check.) There are also a number of tax increases included in the health care law, Ellis said, some of which apply directly to small businesses. For one, he said, businesses with more than 50 employees could face a tax penalty if they don't provide enough health insurance to their employees. Another example, the 10 percent tanning tax, which he said is "nearly exclusively applied to small businesses." "So the overall story is much more of a problem for small firms than the Obama administration would suggest," Ellis said. Curtis Dubay, senior tax policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, allowed that "there have been targeted tax cuts for small businesses." But, he said, "it's an error to just point to the number of tax cuts. You have to look at the overall impact and that certainly has been steep tax hikes." Dubay also noted that six of the 17 cuts were not just for small businesses but were made widely available to all businesses. Richard Morrison at the Tax Foundation, a pro-business group, said that "nothing on (the White House list) stands out as egregiously unjustified from a fact-checking perspective. Some of them are temporary, and some aren’t targeted exclusively at small businesses, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they shouldn’t 'count' "as far as the claim is concerned." We think there's room for critics to note that in addition to the 17 tax cuts enumerated by the White House, there are there are also some tax increases in the health care law that will fall on some of the same small business owners that got tax cuts. Some health care law tax increases won't go into effect for a couple years. And with some, like the excise taxes on tanning beds, one could argue it is a tax on the customer, not the small business. As for allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire at the end of 2012, that's still just an Obama proposal; it hasn't happened. The only policy actually signed by the president so far was a compromise agreement that extended the tax cuts. On balance, we rated Wasserman Schultz's comment Mostly True. Because Obama’s comment is substantially similar, we also rate his comment Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-07-07T13:35:49	2011-07-06	['None']

pomt-13174	"Europe and U.S. households waste 15 times more food than a person in Africa."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/oct/27/foodmentum/advocacy-group-useurope-folks-waste-15x-more-food-/	We know we Americans have big issues with our waistlines, but are our issues with wasted food just as large? A recent tweet from FoodMentum, an anti-food waste advocacy website, says we do. "Europe and US households waste 15 times more food than a person in Africa," the Oct. 10, 2016, tweet said. A nice bit of statistical fodder for a fact-check, we thought. FoodMentum’s funder Maria Huszar told us she got the stat from a blog post on Foodtank, a food policy information clearinghouse. The article used slightly different words, but the gist was the same. "A European or North American consumer wastes 15 times more food than a typical African consumer," it said. Huszar acknowledged she swapped consumer for household. She also lumped Canada in with the United States, but our main concern was to check the accuracy of the gap between the two leading industrialized economic regions and Africa. A quick note here on what’s meant by food waste. That term refers to food that gets thrown in the trash, either by retailers -- think supermarkets and restaurants -- or consumers. That’s separate from food loss, which happens at farms, in transport, and at food-processing plants. Those products fall by the wayside due to spoilage or blemishes or wasteful production methods. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization commissioned a benchmark study on both losses and waste in 2011. It concluded that the per-capita food waste by consumers in Europe and North-America is between 95 and 115 kilograms a year. In sub-Saharan Africa and south and southeast Asia, it’s between 6 and 11 kilograms a year. Those numbers might seem clear. but they actually leave plenty of room for uncertainty. You can play with the ratios and get results that vary from more than 15, less than 15 and pretty close to 15. But most important for the claim we’re vetting, this study doesn’t give a clear estimate of food waste for sub-Saharan Africa alone. It gives a range that includes much of Asia. Vaclav Smil, professor emeritus at the University of Manitoba, Canada, told us there’s good reason to keep the figures vague. Smil, who has written many books and articles on the intersection of food, policy, energy and the environment, said too much data is missing. "All countries, except Japan, have only approximate, derived, assumed, secondary waste data," Smil said. While some work has been done in Europe and the United States, the U.S. Food and Agriculture Organization reported in 2013 that "there are currently no published studies available related to the exact amount of food waste in developing countries." Smil said the difference between North America and Europe compared to sub-Saharan Africa could fall anywhere between five and more than 12. All we can say for sure, according to Smil, is that the gap is large. Researcher Brian Lipinski at the World Resources Institute in Washington echoed that point. Lipinski said the more important point is that overall food losses occur very differently. "In the U.S. and Europe it's mostly on the consumer end," he said. "While in places like Africa, it's much more on the production end due to factors like pests, lack of adequate storage, and lack of infrastructure." More money = more food waste So why is food waste so much bigger in wealthier countries? As the authors of the 2011 report put it, those "people simply can afford to waste food." That waste takes place at many points. Supermarkets throw out fruits and vegetables that lose a bright fresh look. Restaurants serve portions that go beyond what most people can finish. As for what we do at home, a study in the United Kingdom found plenty of habits that make it more likely that food will end up in the trash. The list includes buying too much because we don’t know what we need and throwing out packaged food as soon as it goes past the printed expiration date, when it’s actually still fine to eat. Smil pointed to one telltale problem -- fewer people cook. "People who do not cook regularly have very poor control of their fridge contents and do a poor job of avoiding preventable losses," he said. And he added that even when people do cook, especially single people, they "engage in little reheating next day." By the way, Lipinski said his group doesn’t argue that if Americans and Europeans wasted less food it would help the nearly 800 million who don’t get enough around the world. It would save billions of gallons of water and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but that would do nothing to improve harvests and storage in places like sub-Saharan Africa. Our ruling The advocacy website FoodMentum said that Americans and Europeans waste 15 times as much food as the typical African. The number is on the high end of estimates and there are plenty of gaps in the data. But experts who study this say people in wealthier countries waste much more food than people in poorer ones. We rate the claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b0e5b3b6-2e90-4d24-963f-1c3980479917	None	Foodmentum	None	None	None	2016-10-27T14:03:38	2016-10-10	['United_States', 'Europe', 'Africa']
pomt-00385	Says Amy McGrath "wants to fund more welfare for people who can work, but don’t."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/sep/07/congressional-leadership-fund/new-attack-ad-twists-mcgrath-stance-welfare-work-r/	Hannah Thornton, a single mom, sits in her kitchen and praises the GOP tax plan in a new ad running in Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District. As the screen cuts to a sepia-toned image of the U.S. Capitol building, Hannah says, "I don’t understand why Amy McGrath ... wants to fund more welfare for people who can work, but don’t." Amy McGrath, a former Marine fighter pilot, is the Democratic candidate running against incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Andy Barr in what is expected to be a November toss-up race. The two have sparred on the role that welfare, and specifically Medicaid, should play in Kentucky. The sponsor of the ad is the Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican PAC closely aligned with House Speaker Paul Ryan. We wanted to know whether McGrath has called for "more welfare" for people who can work, but don't. The Congressional Leadership Fund pointed us toward two instances in which, they say, McGrath supported welfare for those who are able to work but don’t: her stances on a Kentucky Medicaid waiver, and the 2018 farm bill. Key takeaways McGrath opposes work requirements for Medicaid and SNAP recipients. Right now, neither program requires recipients to work to get benefits. McGrath has no plans to extend welfare to more people; she has only advocated for maintaining the status quo. The Kentucky HEALTH conundrum In January 2018, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services approved a proposal from Kentucky leaders through the federal Medicaid waiver application process, in which states can submit proposals to use federal Medicaid funds in nontraditional ways. Under Gov. Matt Bevin's plan, called Kentucky HEALTH, adult Medicaid recipients would be required to work or volunteer to receive benefits, if they are able. In July, a federal judge blocked the measure, saying the proposal didn’t fully consider federal requirements for access to health care. But the idea behind it remains a talking point in the state’s politics. Barr has said that states should be able to set their own policies for health care, and supported the concept of work requirements for benefits, saying it could help recipients "achieve self-sufficiency." McGrath is against work requirements. "I value encouraging people to work, if they are able, but I fail to see why we are linking that to having health care," she said to Lex18, a local NBC affiliate. "We can't punish those who need assistance as a cruel way to cut the state budget." Currently, Kentucky’s Medicaid program does not have job requirements. McGrath’s opposition to Kentucky HEALTH does not necessarily mean she wants to expand Medicaid to cover more people, or to make easier for those without jobs to receive insurance, as the ad claims. Instead, she supports the status quo: providing Medicaid to low-income Kentuckians, even those without jobs. Farm tax, food stamps The Congressional Leadership Fund also pointed us to the 2018 farm bill, which included new regulations for food stamps, known as SNAP. Under the initial draft of the bill, SNAP recipients would be required to work or do job training at least 20 hours per week. The farm bill has not yet become law. The version with work requirements was passed by the House in June 2018. The Senate passed their version just a week later, but they removed the controversial work requirements. McGrath, who by this point had retired from teaching at the Naval Academy to campaign full-time, tweeted a critique of the work requirements, saying they "would take away SNAP assistance to thousands of veterans and active duty military families who rely on these benefits." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Andrew S. London, professor of sociology at Syracuse University, studies the relationship between SNAP benefits and the military. He said there is support for McGrath’s notion that a work requirement might lead to reduced benefits going to a subpopulation of veterans. "Our research suggests that SNAP use among veterans and reserve/guard who are either unemployed or not in the labor force is substantial," he said. Much like the Medicaid debate, McGrath isn’t pushing for more welfare for unemployed Americans. Instead, she wants to keep eligibility requirements as they currently are, allowing many people — including unemployed veterans — to keep their benefits. Our ruling An ad by the Congressional Leadership Fund says that McGrath "wants to fund more welfare for people who can work, but don’t." This is exaggerated, and it hinges on the use of "more" to create a deceptive picture about her position. McGrath spoke out against the Kentucky HEALTH plan, which would have required Medicaid recipients to work or do community service in order to receive benefits. She also objected to the House version of the 2018 farm bill, which would have imposed stricter work requirements on SNAP recipients. However, in both instances, McGrath hasn’t called for more welfare. Rather, she opposes imposing work requirements and disqualifying some current recipients. McGrath has said she wants to keep the status quo on welfare, not to increase it or make it easier for people not to work. The statement is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.

pomt-02513	Kip Kinkel and Clackamas Town Center shootings "both where citizen with gun stopped the crime"	false	/oregon/statements/2014/feb/12/oregon-citizens-lobby/were-kip-kinkel-and-clackamas-town-center-shooting/	Gun-control proposals, both in Oregon and nationally, continue to generate controversy. Even ideas with widespread public support, such as universal background checks, ignite fierce debates. That much was clear Feb. 6, 2014, when Mark Kelly, the husband of former Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords -- who was critically injured in a 2011 shooting -- testified at an Oregon legislative hearing in favor of a bill that would expand background checks. A member of the Oregon Citizens Lobby, a conservative activist group, took to Twitter to say that Kelly was testifying. The tweet indicated that Kelly’s remarks included mention of Kip Kinkel, who shot and killed his parents before killing two fellow Thurston High School students in 1998, and the Dec. 11, 2012, shooting at Clackamas Town Center that left three people, including the shooter, dead. "He mentions Kip Kinkle (sic) & Clackamas TC," the tweet continued, "both where citizen with gun stopped the crime." The tweet caught our attention. Were both of those tragic incidents halted when armed citizens intervened? PolitiFact Oregon checked. We checked the Oregon Citizens Lobby’s website but found it contains no phone numbers. It does list email contacts for subjects including health care, taxes, education and "law enforcement, military and firearms." We emailed the latter and received a reply from someone who identified himself only as "Bill D., Team lead, Oregon Citizens Lobby, Law Enforcement, Military and Firearms." (In a subsequent email, he declined to give his full name.) Regarding the Town Center shooting, Bill D. wrote, "Clackamas Mall is easy...the Oregonian covered it well." The email provided a link to a story in The Oregonian and on OregonLive.com, which reported the account of Nick Meli, who told authorities he trained his own gun on mall shooter Jacob Tyler Roberts. Meli didn’t shoot for fear of hitting a bystander, according to one of several statements he gave to police and reporters. The story added that Meli also told a local television station that Roberts appeared to spot him "and that afterward, Meli heard only one more shot, and suspects it was the one Roberts used to kill himself." Bill D.’s email then addressed the Thurston High School shooting. It retracted that part of the initial tweet, saying: "...other students (unarmed) tackled Kip Kinkel. The tweet was likely in error here." So far, the group, was batting .500 on the original tweet’s accuracy. We agree that no one with a gun stopped Kinkel. News accounts and official reports show that brothers Jake and Josh Ryker and classmate Tony Case tackled Kinkel while he was trying to reload and held him until police arrived. To fact-check Meli’s role in the Town Square shootings, we called the Clackamas County Sheriff’s Office, which took the lead in investigating the incident. "It’s inconclusive on our end," said Lt. Robert Wurpes, office spokesman. "We can’t say either way whether he did or did not make a difference. It would only be speculation." Other news accounts in the days after the shooting indicated that Meli changed his story slightly. According to police reports, Meli’s first contact with deputies took place as the search for Roberts was still unfolding. Meli had a handgun out when officers first saw him. He provided information about the shooter but did not mention a confrontation with Roberts. The next day, Meli told police he saw Roberts and drew his gun but didn’t fire out of fear of striking someone. The day after that, Meli added that Roberts looked at him and saw that Meli saw him before running off, according to a story by Rick Bella of The Oregonian. After that, Meli cut interviews short. His silence, Bella wrote, "has effectively divided the public into two camps: One that believes Meli is a hero, a good guy with a gun who stopped a bad guy with a gun, preventing further bloodshed. The other believes Meli embellished his story to take undue credit." When we emailed the Oregon Citizens Lobby for a response, "BD" responded by writing: "Cops will not declare that a private citizen stopped a shooting unless the evidence is absolutely incontrovertible. Quotes from them are usually taken before an investigation is complete and they of course don’t want to prejudice the investigation." A member of the Oregon Citizens Lobby tweeted during a gun-control hearing that the Thurston and Clackamas Town Center shootings were stopped by armed bystanders. The Oregon Citizens Lobby acknowledged it erred in the Thurston case. Nick Meli’s role at Clackamas Town Center remains open to debate. Did his drawn weapon prompt the shooter to flee? There is no proof that it did. We rate the claim False. After publication, we heard from Tony Case, who told us he was shot by Kinkel and that he did not help tackle the shooter. News accounts at the time differ, but we are the first to acknowledge that Case is in a position to know. Return to OregonLive.com/politics to comment on this ruling.

pomt-09129	Says she was never a member of the Georgia Log Cabin Republicans.	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2010/jun/16/karen-handel/did-handel-ever-joing-log-cabin-republicans/	Karen Handel, who wants to become the state’s first female governor, is getting a high-profile education in Republican primary politics -- bare-knuckled Georgia style. One of Handel’s opponents, former U.S. Rep. Nathan Deal, has publicly attacked Handel for her cozy relationship with the gay community earlier in her political career when she was campaigning for the Fulton County Commission and later its chairmanship. Among other things, Deal has alleged Handel was a member of the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay rights GOP organization that endorsed both her 2002 and 2003 election bids. Handel and her strategists have repeatedly denied she was ever a member of the group, including in a June 9 article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. In the article, Marc Yeager, who was president of the Georgia group in 2002 and 2003, said that Handel was a “dues-paying member of the Georgia Log Cabin Republicans from 2002 to 2004, something Handel also denies.” Deal continues to insist Handel was a member. So who’s telling the truth? To understand what’s going on here, you have to turn back the political clock seven or eight years. Back to very different campaigns. Handel was then seeking a job where Fulton County’s large and politically active gay community was a key constituency. The support of that community is vital to anyone seeking office locally. Both Republicans and Democrats aggressively court the gay vote. But in a statewide Republican primary, the dynamics change dramatically, tilting strongly conservative. In statewide races, the clout of gay voters fades. In a statewide Republican primary, the conservative vote moves to the forefront. And that vote can easily be a decisive factor in a multicandidate contest like the one in which Deal and Handel find themselves. Deal is trying to paint Handel as overly friendly with Atlanta’s gay community in an effort to cut into the most conservative part of her voter base. Make no mistake, this is a fight to the finish. At most, only two candidates of the seven running will emerge from the July 20 GOP primary. Deal’s camp has gone for Handel’s jugular over her outreach to gay voters. And Deal’s strategists think they smell blood. Handel’s camp has responded by accusing Deal of having a “history of bigoted remarks.” A news release by the Handel camp late last week said this: “When he [Deal] found out that 8 years ago Karen Handel spoke to the Log Cabin Republicans ... it sent him into a month-long, delusional attack against her.” Deal has, among other things, accused Handel of supporting “gay adoption” during her Fulton County Commission bids. There is scant evidence of that, and PolitiFact Georgia has previously given the former congressman a “Barely True” on the Truth-O-Meter for that accusation. But the paper and electronic trail on Handel and the Log Cabin Republicans is much stronger. The Southern Voice, a newspaper that catered to the gay community and later went bankrupt, carried numerous articles about Handel’s 2002 and 2003 commission runs. And in those she is repeatedly identified as a member of the Georgia Log Cabin Republicans. Handel never asked for a correction or clarification. Handel spokesman Dan McLagan agrees with that last point. “The Southern Voice is going to say all kinds of wacky stuff,” McLagan said. “The fact a retraction was not asked for is not proof of the assertion. She probably wasn’t sitting around reading a gay tabloid.” McLagan added: “She doesn’t remember ever having been a member.” But Yeager, the Log Cabin leader at the time, said he does remember. “Karen handed me the check [for her membership dues],” he said during an interview with PolitiFact Georgia. And he happens to be a guy who keeps a record of his e-mails. One of those, from Yeager to Log Cabin board member Cathy Dudley in March 2003, contains an attachment -- a mailing list for the hundred or so Georgia Log Cabin members at that time. The list was being used to mail monthly invites to Log Cabin meetings. Handel’s name, telephone numbers, e-mail address and home address are on that list, which was examined by PolitiFact Georgia. It clearly lists her as a dues-paying member whose membership ran through July 2003. Another attachment in a later e-mail listed her as a member through July 2004. McLagan was unimpressed. He suggested that Jamie Ensley, the current president of the Georgia Log Cabin Republicans, had membership records indicating Handel was not a member of the group. Unlike Yeager, however, Ensley declined to share membership records with PolitiFact Georgia. “Under no circumstances can I share our memberships rolls,” Ensley said. McLagan, meanwhile, questioned the motives of Yeager, who is no longer with the Log Cabin Republicans. McLagan said Yeager’s partner is an Obama supporter. Yeager said that is true, but he stands by his statements and e-mails about Handel’s earlier membership in the Log Cabin Republicans. “My partner, Roger, ... applied for becoming an Obama delegate early in the process but never pursued it due to the time required for the whole nomination and delegate process,” Yeager said in an e-mail to the AJC. “I don’t think he ever went to any meetings. Certainly it has been no secret that he always has been and still is a Democrat. This was always a point of curiosity within the gay press with me being president of Georgia LCR [Log Cabin Republicans].” ‘Nuf said, or so says McLagan. “These guys have an agenda,” McLagan said. Handel, however, is running against fellow Republicans at this point in the race, not Democrats. And it is a fellow Republican who has accused her of belonging to the Log Cabin Republicans. What about Yeager’s e-mails that show Handel’s name appeared on the Log Cabin Republicans’ membership roll? They certainly appear genuine. “I can type up an e-mail that says anything,” McLagan said. Perhaps. But the evidence is overwhelming that Handel did indeed belong to the Georgia Log Cabin Republicans -- whether or not she remembers it. Newspapers reported it. A membership list backs it up. And the man running the organization at the time swears by it. Handel and her handlers, however, still choose to deny it. This might have rated a False on the Truth-O-Meter. But the complex dance Handel has engaged in over this issue moves it up a notch. Seems the metro Atlanta temperatures aren’t the only thing a bit overheated these days. We give her a Pants On Fire.

pomt-10024	"A middle-class family donates $1 to charity, they get 15 cents off their income tax. Bill Gates donates $1 to charity, he takes 35 cents off his income tax."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/11/robert-gibbs/No-wonder-the-rich-give-so-much-to-charity/	In defending President Obama's plan to reduce tax deductions for high earners, the White House has said the tax code is tilted toward rich guys. They've understated the case considerably. We'll explain how in a bit. First, some background: The issue arose when Obama proposed reducing the percentage of charitable contributions that taxpayers who earn more than $250,000 can take as a tax deduction, from 35 to 28 percent. That would raise about $318 billion toward Obama's proposed $634 billion "reserve fund" to be used to reform health care, according to Obama's budget proposal. Critics, including some Republicans and nonprofit executives, don't like the idea. At a White House news briefing, Jake Tapper of ABC News said the proposal was controversial and asked White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, "Are you willing to consider a different revenue stream than that tax increase to fund health care?" "Well, I do think all issues are on the table," Gibbs replied. "Let's, though, just discuss the — I assume you're talking about the charitable contribution — I mean, a middle-class family donates a dollar to charity, they get 15 cents off their income tax. Bill Gates donates a dollar to charity, he takes 35 cents off his income tax. The proposal that the White House has would simply reduce those levels to the same levels that we saw during the Reagan administration." Budget director Peter Orszag made the same argument in this blog post . Let's walk through how charitable deductions impact taxes. If you donate $1 to charity, you can list that as a deduction, meaning you can subtract $1 from your income before calculating your taxes. High earners like Bill Gates pay a tax rate of 35 percent on the portion of their income that is over about $350,000. So if they subtract $1 from their taxable income, their tax burden drops by 35 percent of $1, which is 35 cents. By contrast, couples with taxable income between $16,700 and $67,900 pay a top tax rate of 15 percent. If they make that same $1 contribution, and subtract the $1 from their income, their tax burden falls by just 15 percent of $1, or 15 cents. Gibbs' point rests on the contention that couples making between $16,700 and $67,900 are middle class, which we believe is fair — the median household income in the U.S. is $50,233 . So Gibbs was right, except that he understated the case. Here's how: First, you can't take any deduction for a charitable contribution unless you itemize your taxes. Folks in the 15 percent tax bracket are unlikely to do so, while rich folks are very likely to. Only 35 percent of all taxpayers itemized their taxes in 2004, but 87 percent of taxpayers in the top 10 percent were itemizers, according to the Urban Institute . We're not going to penalize Gibbs for understating his case, because his numbers hold true when comparing two taxpayers who itemize, and he confined his comment to the income tax. It's worth noting that the rich only enjoy bigger deductions because they pay more taxes — a top tax rate of 35 percent instead of 15 percent, and an estate tax on top of that. But it's also true that a charitable contribution of, say, $1,000 will take a much bigger bite out of a middle-class person's income than a high earner's. That's all academic though. The bottom line is that Gibbs' number are accurate. We find this claim to be True.	None	Robert Gibbs	None	None	None	2009-03-11T17:31:43	2009-03-05	['Bill_Gates']

pomt-01722	"It cost us more to shut the government down than to keep it open."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/07/rand-paul/rand-paul-rightly-says-government-shutdown-was-mor/	This week, Rand Paul is on a 10-stop tour of Iowa, seen by many as a trial run for a 2016 presidential campaign. He’s been touting out his campaign positions, such as raising the retirement age and trying to play up his support for Israel. In a speech in Iowa City Tuesday, stumping for Republican House candidate Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Paul spoke about what he sees as out-of-control government spending. He also talked about the government shutdown last fall. Paul voted against the budget deals that led to the shutdown, but he said he thought shutting down the government was a "bad idea." And he carried the same position in Iowa this week. "It cost us more to shut the government down than to keep it open," Paul said. "You know your government’s dysfunctional if it costs more to shut it down than to keep it open, because we paid all these people." Coming from someone like Paul, who has been known to oppose government spending, that comment intrigued us. (We noticed it when Yahoo! News political reporter Chris Moody, who was there, tweeted it out.) The economics Paul’s comment referred to the 2013 government shutdown, which lasted just over two weeks from Oct. 1 to Oct. 16. During those two weeks, up to 850,000 workers were furloughed per day, national parks shut their doors, government-funded scientific research halted, and various health and safety inspections -- out of agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration -- were put on hold. So how does not spending money come at a cost? "Sen. Paul was making the point that the government never actually shut down during the so called 'shutdown,'" a spokesman told us. "Even though some government employees were furloughed, salaries were still paid for those who didn't work and government had to pay interest on late payments." We found that this was true. The government still functioned partially during the shutdown, and furloughed employees got back pay. On top of doling out delayed payments, the government faced late payment penalties and other logistical costs associated with preparing or recuperating from two weeks of stalled activity. They also lost revenue from national parks and museums. But a more significant and documented blow was to the economy as a whole. We found a solid consensus among economists that the shutdown was expensive to the U.S. economy in terms of actual costs and lost productivity. The most thorough report examining the shutdown came out of Nov. 7, 2013, from the Office of Management and Budget, which reports directly to the president. (Paul’s spokesman pointed us to this New York Times article about the White House report as evidence.) Here’s a few highlights: $2.5 billion in compensation costs for furloughed workers (whose lack of pay for two weeks hampered consumer spending); 120,000 fewer private-sector jobs created in the first half of October; $500 million lost in visitor spending because of closed National Parks ; $11 million in lost National Parks and Smithsonian Institution revenue; Interest accrued on billions of dollars of payments owed to third parties that the government was unable to pay during the shutdown; Resources spent on putting activities in standby or maintaining them in an idle mode; 1.2 million Internal Revenue Service identity verification requests that couldn’t be processed, causing a delay in private-sector lending and other activities; Stalled approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration delayed moving products to market. We also found estimates from financial analytics companies in the private sector. All of these (about a dozen) showed a negative effect on the economy, though. Most of the estimates predicted that the shutdown would not affect the economy’s growth path substantially. (The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service compiled the reports in 2013.) Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics, said the shutdown stunted fourth quarter GDP growth by 0.5 points, resulting in a $20 billion hit. The shutdown disrupted federal spending, global trade and investments in housing and businesses. Additionally, in the shutdown’s aftermath, consumers held back spending and foreign confidence in the American economy waned. Standard and Poor's said the shutdown took $24 billion out of the economy and reduced yearly fourth quarter GDP growth by 0.6 percent. (In December, the comic strip Doonesbury referenced this report, and we rated it Mostly True.) Macroeconomic Advisers (in a report for the Peterson Foundation) estimated the shutdown cut 0.3 points off of fourth-quarter growth, "mainly by interrupting the flow of services produced by federal employees." The Macroeconomic Advisers report said private-sector effects were limited, especially because the furloughed workers received back pay. Bloomberg News surveyed 71 economists and found the median GDP growth projection immediately after the shutdown was 0.4 points lower than a survey conducted a month earlier. The counterargument In consulting experts and scouring shutdown coverage, we found no economic modeling or analysis that showed the economy staying neutral or experiencing positive growth as a result of the shutdown. Some libertarians argue -- such as economist Jeff Dorfman for Forbes -- that just because the government didn’t spend money for two weeks doesn’t mean that the same amount of money didn’t get spent elsewhere in the private sector, though he did not provide data or other proof that this was happening. Dan Mitchell of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, made a similar argument, but offered a caveat -- that when government spending is suddenly reduced, the economy doesn’t instantaneously recalibrate itself, so there can be economic "bumps" in the immediate aftermath -- such as what was seen in the shutdown. Our ruling: Paul said, "It cost us more to shut the government down than to keep it open." Numerous independent economic research groups found that the shutdown resulted in overall costs, in terms of lost revenue, hindered GDP growth, stalled private-sector activity and actual expenditures associated with the logistics of closing the government for two weeks. The government had to pay all of what it normally would have spent during that two-week period and then some. There was very little evidence to the contrary. We rate this claim True.

Because next April you’re going to, in many cases, (file) one page, one card. It’s going to be very, very different. Very, very different."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/09/donald-trump/can-taxpayers-expect-card-sized-tax-forms-file-nex/	If you are struggling to finish and file your taxes right now, something President Donald Trump said during a recent visit to West Virginia probably sounds like a godsend. "This will be the last time — April — that you’re going to (fill out) that old-fashioned, big, lots of pages, complicated tax form," Trump said during his April 5 visit. "Because next April you’re going to, in many cases, (file) one page, one card. It’s going to be very, very different. Very, very different." Trump was focused on this point, saying at another occasion during the event, "You’ll have a nice, simple form next year. This will be the last year. So take pictures of it and enjoy it. This is the last time you’ll have to file a very complex and big tax form. It will be much easier starting next April." But Trump’s assurance is dubious. There isn’t an option today for filing taxes on a "card" — and there’s nothing in the new law that would create one. The idea for this popped up in November. House Republicans touted their plan as one that could be accommodated by a postcard-sized form. The president liked the idea so much that he held one up and kissed it for the cameras when meeting with lawmakers at the White House. "It's going to make life very simple," he said Nov. 2, 2017. "The only people that aren't going to like this is H&R Block. They're not going to be very happy. That's probably one of the only companies in the country that's not going to be thrilled." In the end, the bill didn't require this. There is already a pretty easy way to file your tax returns, the 1040EZ form. It looks like this, with just one page to fill out: "While it’s not postcard-sized, it’s pretty simple, and whatever they end up with in the future will probably look a lot like that currently does," said Patrick Newton, a spokesman for the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, told us in December. The 1040EZ is also popular. According to IRS statistics for the 2015 tax year, 23.3 million tax filers used the 1040EZ. That’s about one of every six filers. Could the number of people using the 1040EZ increase in 2019 due to the tax bill’s passage? When we checked with the White House, they told us that Trump was referring to increases in the standard deduction and the curtailment of the alternative minimum tax for many taxpayers, results that should simplify tax filings for many Americans. Before the new law took effect, about 70 percent of filers used the standard deduction, said John Buhl, a spokesman for the Tax Foundation. "With the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in place, we estimate that could increase to about 90 percent of filers," he said. "Using the standard deduction rather than itemizing certainly makes filing taxes a simpler process." However, Buhl added, "the basic forms and process for submitting a return either with the standard deduction or with itemized deductions will not change much. So we aren’t at the point of just needing a postcard." Meanwhile, some filers could actually see greater complexity than in the past, Buhl said. "There are new pass-through business deduction rules looming that could provide an additional tax cut for some, but likely make their filings more complex," he said. Joseph Rosenberg, senior research associate at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, has told us that the number of 1040EZ users might increase on the margins, but added that "there are relatively few people who currently itemize who have a simple enough situation" to shift to the 1040EZ. Our ruling Trump said, "This will be the last time — April — that you’re going to (fill out) that old-fashioned, big, lots of pages, complicated tax form. Because next April you’re going to, in many cases, (file) one page, one card. It’s going to be very, very different. Very, very different." There is no new card- or postcard-filing option in the pipeline due to the law passed last December. As it happens, simpler filing options already exist and are widely used — but tax experts do not expect a surge in their use as a result of the tax bill in April 2019.

pomt-10935	"Every time Trump comes here to play golf, Florida taxpayers are paying for it. ... Jeff Greene will put a stop to that day 1."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2018/jul/26/jeff-greene/could-florida-governor-bill-feds-police-trumps-gol/	Jeff Greene, a Democrat billionaire running for Florida governor, has some close connections to President Donald Trump: He is a member of Trump’s Mar-A-Lago club, and they are neighbors in Palm Beach. But that hasn’t stopped Greene from criticizing Trump for receiving taxpayer-funded protection during his South Florida visits: "Every time Trump comes here to play golf, Florida taxpayers are paying for it. Millions wasted in road closures and overtime. Jeff Greene will put a stop to that day one," said Greene’s TV ad promoting his Democratic primary bid for governor. Here’s where Greene has a point: The Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office has spent millions on security for Trump’s visits. Here’s what Greene left out: The federal government has already reimbursed local law enforcement agencies for protecting Trump. And while the next governor could send a bill to the federal government, it would likely end up in the shredder. Florida’s costs reimbursed Greene’s spokeswoman pointed to a Palm Beach Post article that found local law enforcement agencies fronted more than $5.7 million to help protect Trump between November 2017 and April 2018. Most of that money was spent by the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office, while smaller amounts were spent by West Palm Beach and Palm Beach police departments. However, the federal government has already established a process for reimbursement. The Presidential Residence Protection Assistance Grant provided $41 million to reimburse state and local law enforcement agencies for costs incurred between Jan. 21, 2017, and Sept. 30, 2017, while protecting Trump’s residences in Florida, New York and New Jersey. The Federal Emergency Management Agency administers these funds. In 2017, the largest grant recipient was the New York City Police Department, which helps guard Trump Tower. The department received about $36 million. In Palm Beach County, the sheriff’s office received $3.3 million, the full amount it sought for reimbursement, according to Therese Barbera, a sheriff spokeswoman. The town of Palm Beach received $71,000 and West Palm Beach received $63,000. In a neighboring county, the Broward Sheriff’s Office also received money. Local law enforcement agencies can submit their next requests for federal reimbursement in October. While Greene cited Trump’s visits to play golf, Trump doesn’t only play golf while in Palm Beach County. Trump has conducted some business while in South Florida, including hosting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Mar-A-Lago. But he is clearly a fan of golf. PolitiFact’s Trump Golf Tracker showed that as of May 18, 2018, he had at least 56 confirmed golf outings, including some in Florida. (Our tabulation could be an undercount since it is based on confirmed golf outings. The New York Times has tracked how many times Trump has visited his properties, including golf courses, which adds up to 170 as of mid-July.) Governor’s power to bill the federal government limited Greene said he would put a stop to this. We can't fact-check whether he will, because that's a prediction. But we can analyze whether the governor has control. Campaign spokeswoman Claire VanSusteren pointed to a line in Article 7 Section 1 in the Florida Constitution that states, "No money shall be drawn from the treasury except in pursuance of appropriation made by law." We sent Greene’s constitutional argument to a few Florida legal experts: Nova Southeastern University law professor Robert Jarvis; Talbot "Sandy" D’Alemberte, a former president of the American Bar Association and former president of Florida State University; and Raoul Cantero, a former Florida Supreme Court judge and a partner at White and Case law firm. The experts would essentially say to Greene: Good luck with that. This portion of the Florida Constitution is about taxation — the state budget says nothing about relations with the federal government. There is nothing in that section that would compel the federal government to comply with such a request from a governor. Jarvis said that a state governor has no power over a president. "This is because of a legal doctrine known as the ‘superior sovereign doctrine.’ Under it, a lower government official cannot order a higher government official to do anything," he said. "This stems from medieval times, when a king could order a prince to do things, but a prince could not order a king to do anything. In our country, this means that the states are subservient to the federal government." Our ruling Greene said, "Every time Trump comes here to play golf, Florida taxpayers are paying for it. Millions wasted in road closures and overtime. Jeff Greene will put a stop to that day 1." Local law enforcement in Palm Beach County have spent millions on security when Trump visits, but they have submitted their costs for reimbursement, and will continue to do so. Greene cites a portion of the Florida Constitution about taxation that he says he would use to submit a bill to the federal government. He could certainly try that, but the legal experts we talked to said that’s not the purpose of that part of the Constitution. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-12969	Says President Barack Obama "has not condemned" shootings targeting police.	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2016/dec/27/larry-pratt/pants-fire-larry-pratt-says-obama-hasnt-decried-ki/	Larry Pratt, the longtime leader of Gun Owners of America, says President Barack Obama has been nonchalant about ambush shootings targeting police. "There have been officers simply gunned down because they had a uniform on," Pratt said during a Dec. 15 radio interview on WINA in Charlottesville. "It’s not just Dallas, it’s other places as well and the thing that frankly concerns me as I think about this is that the president not only has not condemned this, he actually seems to have a rationale that maybe this is what you would expect in the United States with its history of slavery and racial impression and so forth. "That doesn’t help in the here and now," added Pratt, a Republican who represented Fairfax County in the General Assembly in the early 1980s. "We don’t have slavery and we don’t have racial oppression, but we do have cops getting killed." We wondered whether Pratt, whose organization is headquartered in Fairfax County and has criticized the NRA as being soft on gun rights, was correct that Obama never "condemned" the murders of police. So we examined the records and found three statements by Obama that decimate Pratt’s claim. Dallas On the night of July 7, 2016, a sniper killed five Dallas policemen and wounded seven in the deadliest attack for police since 9/11. The assassin, before dying at the scene, said he was angered by the fatal police shootings of black men in Louisiana and Minnesota that had dominated national news in previous days. Obama denounced the sniper’s acts the next morning as "a vicious, calculated and despicable attack on law enforcement." He added, "I believe that I speak for every single American when I say that we are horrified over these events and that we stand united with the people and the police department in Dallas." The president also said, "There is no possible justification for these kinds of attacks or any violence against law enforcement." Obama was in Europe at the time to attend a NATO Summit and to hold meetings with leaders in Poland and in Spain. He cut short the trip by one day to speak at a memorial service in Dallas for the slain policemen. Baton Rouge Three Baton Rouge law enforcement officers were ambushed and shot to death on July, 17, 2016. The assassin, who was killed at the scene, had vowed in an email to avenge the recent police killings of blacks. Obama issued a statement that day that said, "For the second time in two weeks, police officers who put their lives on the line for ours every day were doing their job when they were killed in a cowardly and reprehensible assault. These are attacks on public servants, on the rule of law, and on civilized society, and they have to stop." New York Two New York City policemen sitting in their patrol car were shot at point blank range on Dec. 20, 2014. The New York Times reported that the murderer, who committed suicide near the scene, had made statements on social media that he planned to avenge police killings of black men earlier that year in Ferguson, Mo. and New York. Obama issued a written statement that day that actually used the word "condemn." He wrote: "I unconditionally condemn today's murder of two police officers in New York City. Two brave men won't be going home to their loved ones tonight, and for that, there is no justification. The officers who serve and protect our communities risk their own safety for ours every single day - and they deserve our respect and gratitude every single day. Tonight, I ask people to reject violence and words that harm, and turn to words that heal - prayer, patient dialogue, and sympathy for the friends and family of the fallen." We asked Pratt if he had second thoughts about his comment about Obama. "Nah," he replied, saying the president’s statements deploring the attacks on police have been tempered by other comments Obama has made legitimizing the distrust many blacks have of police officers. For example, Obama said on July 7, 2016, that while most police perform admirably, there are racial "biases, some conscious and unconscious, that have to be rooted out." Pratt told us that Obama "has stirred the pot," on attacking police. "He’s looking for division." We should finally note that Pratt is not the first to accuse Obama of being aloof about the attacks on police. Our colleagues at PunditFact on July 8, 2016, examined a similar comment by William Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police Officers. They rated it Pants on Fire. Our ruling Pratt said Obama never "condemned" murders targeting police. His outrageous statement ignores the president’s expressions of abhorrence following each of three different ambush murders of multiple police officers in the last two years. Obama publicly called the killings "vicious," "reprehensible," "cowardly," and "despicable." Following the 2014 slaying of two New York policemen, Obama used the very word Pratt denies him, saying, "I unconditionally condemn" the murders. We rate Pratt’s claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-14773	In the weekend after the terrorist attacks in Paris, the White House said "this couldn't happen in the United States. ISIS couldn't reach us here."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/dec/08/joe-scarborough/joe-scarborough-says-days-after-paris-attack-white/	President Barack Obama seems "clueless" on the threat of the Islamic State, said MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough. "First of all he won’t even call it Islamic radicalism," Scarborough said on Morning Joe Dec. 4, the day after the deadly terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif. "His White House said, the weekend of Paris, that this couldn't happen in the United States. ISIS couldn't reach us here." It’s accurate that Obama doesn’t call ISIS "Islamic radicalism" or "Islamic extremism." A reader asked us to look into the second part of Scarborough’s statement: that in the days following the Friday, Nov. 13 terrorist attack in Paris, the Obama administration said an ISIS attack couldn’t happen in the United States. An MSNBC spokesperson directed us to comments made by Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, on ABC’s This Week on Nov. 15. But they don’t back up Scarborough’s claim in the least. In the interview, Rhodes said there was no known credible threat to the United States at that moment. He did not say there wasn’t any possibility of ISIS-backed terrorism on U.S. soil whatsoever. Rhodes immediately followed up by pointing out that ISIS has "aspirations to attack the United States." Host George Stephanopoulos: "And is there any intelligence suggesting a specific and credible threat to the homeland? I know yesterday there was none. Has anything new developed there?" Rhodes: "No, George, the president had a meeting yesterday that included the secretary of Homeland Security, the director of the FBI. Our determination is there's not a specific, credible threat to the homeland at this time. But we're going to be very vigilant because we know ISIL has the aspirations to attack the United States as well as our European and other allies and partners." Rhodes added later that one focus of Obama’s meetings with foreign leaders that weekend was "how we can seal that border with Turkey to prevent that flow of foreign fighters and share intelligence to disrupt and prevent attacks in our European allies' countries and, of course, in the United States." So this Rhodes interview doesn’t support Scarborough’s point; rather, Rhodes plainly admits that there is a threat of an ISIS attack in the United States. We looked at other White House statements from around that time and didn’t find anything else to back Scarborough up. Obama delivered a brief statement on Nov. 13 about the terrorist attack in Paris, but he did not address the possibility of terrorist attacks in the United States. At that time, ISIS’s involvement was unclear. In Nov. 15 remarks in Ankara, Turkey, Obama expressed solidarity with France and spoke about the fight against ISIS in the Middle East but did not discuss the potential for attacks in the United States. In a Nov. 16 press conference, also in Turkey, Obama delivered a similar message, but he also explicitly addressed "the possibility of terrorist attacks on our soil." "There are certain advantages that the United States has in preventing these kinds of attacks. Obviously, after 9/11, we hardened the homeland, set up a whole series of additional steps to protect aviation, to apply lessons learned. We’ve seen much better cooperation between the FBI, state governments, local governments. There is some advantages to geography with respect to the United States. "But, having said that, we’ve seen the possibility of terrorist attacks on our soil. There was the Boston Marathon bombers. Obviously, it did not result in the scale of death that we saw in Paris, but that was a serious attempt at killing a lot of people by two brothers and a crockpot. And it gives you some sense of, I think, the kinds of challenges that are going to be involved in this going forward." So in the weekend immediately following the Paris attacks, it doesn’t seem that any White House official dismissed the possibility of an ISIS attack on U.S. soil. Our ruling Scarborough said that in the weekend after the terrorist attacks in Paris, the White House said "this couldn't happen in the United States. ISIS couldn't reach us here." Obama and Rhodes, an adviser, both spoke of the Islamic State’s aspirations to attack the United States in the two or three days following the Paris attacks. They talked about what the government is doing to prevent the group from carrying out its plans. Neither ruled out the possibility that ISIS could stage an attack on U.S. soil, nor did any other White House official. We rate Scarborough’s claim False.

pomt-08219	Texas leads "the country in drunk driving fatalities."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/nov/18/art-acevedo/austin-police-chief-says-texas-leads-nation-drunk-/	Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo cut to the chase during an interview about a law that lets drivers convicted of driving while intoxicated return to the road. "We're in the worst state in the union when it comes to drunk driving and drunk driving fatalities," Acevedo said in an interview with the Austin American-Statesman and Austin's KVUE-TV, Channel 24. "We lead the country in drunk driving fatalities." The interview aired Sunday Nov. 14. Texas, No. 1 in alcohol-fueled driving deaths? We asked Acevedo how he reached his conclusion, then started checking national comparisons. An August 2010 report posted online appears to support the claim. In 2009, Texas tallied 1,235 alcohol-impaired fatalities, according to the report by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, which says the statistic reflects fatalities in crashes involving a driver or motorcycle rider with a blood alcohol concentration of .08 grams per deciliter or greater. The 2009 Texas total exceeded by more than 250 the 950 alcohol-related driving fatalities in California, which was the No. 2 state in the dubious category. States rounding out this top 10 were Florida (770), Pennsylvania (406), South Carolina (377), North Carolina (363), Georgia (331), Ohio (324), New York (321) and Illinois (319). Texas also topped other states in alcohol-impaired fatalities in 2008, the report says. The report also lays out the percentage of total traffic deaths due to alcohol impairment. Texas ranked No. 5 by this gauge, with alcohol impairment accounting for 40 percent of the 3,071 driving deaths in 2009. Four states had higher percentages: Hawaii, 48 percent of 109 deaths; Connecticut, 44 percent of 223 deaths; South Carolina, 42 percent of 894 deaths; and Washington, 42 percent of 492 deaths. Texas's 40 percent matched the percentages of deaths linked to alcohol impairment in South Dakota, Kansas and Rhode Island. Though Texas last year experienced one of the country's largest reductions in total traffic fatalities -- from 3,476 deaths in 2008 to 3,071 in 2009 -- more people still died on Texas roads than in any other state. As with drunk-driving deaths, that toll is influenced by factors such as Texas's size, population and number of miles traveled on its roads. In search of expert perspective on the meaning of such numbers, we reached Bernie Fette, a senior researcher at the Center for Transportation Safety at the Texas Transportation Institute in College Station. He showed us two other ways to compare alcohol-related driving deaths by state, based on the percentage of such deaths for every 100 million vehicle miles traveled or on the number of licensed drivers in each state. Online, NHTSA has posted state-by-state rates of alcohol-impaired driving fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled for 2005 through 2008. We checked the rates over those years for the 10 states that had the most alcohol-impaired driving fatalities in 2009--and found that Texas's rate per 100 million vehicle miles traveled, ranging from .55 in 2007 to a high of .59 in 2006, exceeded that of all but one of the states. South Carolina's rate, ranging from .81 in 2008 to .91 in 2007, was higher every year. The federal agency also provides information on the number of licensed drivers by state as of 2008. We divided the number of alcohol-impaired driving deaths in each state for that year by its licensed driver total. According to the resulting ratios, Texas ranked 9th nationally in alcohol-impaired driving deaths that year. States with higher ratios were topped by Wyoming, followed by Mississippi, South Carolina, Montana, Louisiana, Oklahoma, North Dakota and West Virginia. We also wondered how Texas compares in alcohol-related driving deaths when population is taken into account. We divided the 2009 alcohol-impaired driving deaths for each state by U.S. Census Bureau population estimates for each state. Result: Texas trailed 15 states in deaths per resident. States with higher ratios, led by Wyoming, included North Dakota, Montana, South Carolina, Mississippi, Louisiana, South Dakota, Oklahoma, West Virginia, Alabama, Arkansas, New Mexico, Kansas, Delaware and Missouri. So, it looks like Texas is not No. 1 for drunk driving deaths by every measure. Still, Fette suggested, no matter how you look at the stats on alcohol-impaired driving deaths in Texas, the news isn't good. "If all of the measures rank at the top or nearly at the top, no matter what the (state's) rank is, it's a serious problem that deserves attention," he said. Our take: Several statistical approaches show Texas behind other states in the rate of alcohol-related driving deaths. But it's also reasonable to focus on the sheer number of deaths linked to drunk driving. We rate Acevedo's statement Mostly True.

pomt-12927	"The same 3 senators who have spent the last 3 years s------- themselves over ‘Benghazi!’ just introduced a bill to reduce embassy security by 50 percent."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/12/other-98/meme-exaggerates-gop-senators-bill-embassy-move/	Are three Republican senators who once blasted lax embassy security in Benghazi, Libya, now playing Russian roulette with other embassies around the world? A meme making the social media rounds says so, and readers asked us to check it out. The image includes pictures of three Republican senators — Ted Cruz of Texas, Dean Heller of Nevada and Marco Rubio of Florida — along with the caption, "The same 3 senators who have spent the last 3 years s------- themselves over ‘Benghazi!’ just introduced a bill to reduce embassy security by 50 percent." We wanted to know if the meme was accurate about how these three senators responded to the Sept. 11, 2012, attack by Islamic extremists on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, and whether the lawmakers are indeed trying to roll back embassy security. Many Republicans used the attack to criticize Hillary Clinton, secretary of state at the time, for being insufficiently attentive to embassy security and thus being at least partially at fault for the deaths of four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens. How accurate is this assertion? Actually, it’s misleading on several points. (We were unable to reach the group that created the meme, the Other 98, a group that says it fights "economic injustice, undue corporate influence and threats to democracy.") On the first point, Cruz and Rubio have levied strong opinions about Benghazi and Clinton for years, but it’s a stretch to put Heller in the same category. To cite just one example, Cruz in June 2016 responded to the release of the final report of the House Select Committee on Benghazi by issuing a statement that called it "disturbing" that the "bureaucratic incompetence of the Department of State under Secretary Clinton contributed to the administration’s willful blindness, as the pleas for help from our foreign service officers in Libya were routinely ignored." Rubio, who like Cruz ran for president in 2016, also cast Benghazi as a shadow over Clinton’s record. For instance, during a GOP primary debate in October 2015, Rubio said that Clinton "got exposed as a liar" during her day-long testimony before the Benghazi committee. (The Washington Post Fact Checker gave this Two Pinocchios out of a maximum of four.) And Rubio released a statement that rapped Clinton for the "extraordinary failure" by State Department officials, including Clinton, "to grasp the security risks in Libya and Benghazi in particular, and take the appropriate action to protect Americans stationed in that country." Heller, however, has been much more circumspect about Benghazi. We found less rhetoric about Benghazi by Heller than by either Cruz or Rubio in our searches of Google, Lexis-Nexis and their respective Senate websites. For instance, Heller issued a statement calling for "thoughts and prayers" for the victims the day after the attacks took place, and another one two days later specifically memorializing one of the victims, Tyrone Woods, who was a Nevada resident. Those are the only two releases related to Benghazi on his Senate website. The only other examples linking Heller and Benghazi that came up in Nexis or Google searches occurred after the recent bill’s introduction. Meanwhile, the meme’s argument that the senators are hypocrites for wanting to cut embassy security by 50 percent is exaggerated. The bill at issue is S. 11, the Jerusalem Embassy and Recognition Act, which Cruz, Rubio and Heller laid out in a joint news release. The main focus of S. 11 is on moving the American embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem -- something that Congress mandated in 1995 when it passed the Jerusalem Embassy and Relocation Act. Presidents of both parties have declined to carry out the move, expressing concerns that doing so would complicate the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians. President-elect Donald Trump is seen as more supportive of an embassy move. The part about the 50-percent cut for embassy security isn’t made up. The bill says that if the embassy is not moved, then "not more than 50 percent of the amounts appropriated to the Department of State for fiscal year 2017 under the heading ‘Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance’ may be obligated until the Secretary of State determines and reports to Congress that the United States Embassy in Jerusalem has officially opened." The bill has not yet been taken up. So saying that the senators "introduced a bill to reduce embassy security by 50 percent" is misleading. The senators introduced a bill to move the embassy, using the specter of a budget cut as leverage to support that goal -- not as the goal itself. None of them affirmatively wants to cut embassy security funding, though they are willing to risk that outcome if their primary goal is not met. In the Jan. 3 news release announcing the bill, the three senators didn’t even mention the threat of a security cut, while repeatedly highlighting their goal of moving the embassy. In addition, Heller’s office told PolitiFact that a different State Department account than the one mentioned in the bill -- the Diplomatic and Consular Programs account -- is a "critical source" of funds for "high threat protection needs, security technology, armored vehicles, cyber security, and diplomatic couriers." And that account would not be touched by the threatened cuts. Finally, it’s worth noting that this is the fourth time Heller has introduced a bill along these lines -- S.1622, introduced on Sept, 23, 2011; S.604, introduced on March 19, 2013; S.117, introduced on Jan. 7, 2015; and the current bill. So one could just as easily view the bill’s introduction as the latest in a series of nearly identical bills that Heller has introduced like clockwork since 2011 -- almost a year before the Benghazi attacks took place. Our ruling A meme from the Other 98 said, "The same 3 senators who have spent the last 3 years s------- themselves over ‘Benghazi!’ just introduced a bill to reduce embassy security by 50 percent." The meme has a point — Cruz, Rubio and Heller did submit a bill that seeks to leverage the threat of a 50 percent cut to the State Department’s "Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance" account in the service of forcing the executive branch to move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. However, the meme goes too far in suggesting that the 50 percent cut was the purpose of the bill, and it ignores that some of the most important security funds would be untouched. The meme also ignores that essentially the same bill was introduced almost a year before the Benghazi attacks, and it incorrectly labels Heller as one of the more outspoken Republican lawmakers on Benghazi.

pomt-14298	"Over 97 percent of the scientific community … believe that humans are contributing to climate change."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2016/apr/04/don-beyer/don-beyer-says-97-percent-scientists-believe-human/	It’s time to stop debating the science behind whether humans contribute to rising temperatures, says U.S. Rep. Don Beyer, D-8th. "Even while over 97 percent of the scientific community and the vast majority of Americans believe that humans are contributing to climate change, a small but well-heeled cohort continues to deny and even try to discredit what objective science tells us unambiguously," he wrote in a March 24 post on his congressional website. This Truth-O-Meter will focus on Beyer’s claim that 97 percent of the scientific community believes humans are a cause of climate change - a figure widely cited by those urging efforts to stem global warming. Climate change skeptics repeatedly have said the figure is not credible. We asked Beyer for the source of his statistic. His spokesman, Thomas Scanlon, pointed to several articles in scientific journals, information from NASA, and other sources about climate change. Let’s start with NASA. Here’s what its website says: "Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals show that 97 percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree: Climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities. In addition, most of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position." So the federal space agency notes that the 97 percent figure more narrowly focuses on "actively publishing climate scientists." That’s different from Beyer’s broad contention that 97 percent the entire "scientific community" thinks humans contribute to global warming. Still, this leaves us with the question: What are the sources for the 97 percent? NASA points to several of them in a footnote on its website. Cook study The first is a 2013 study by John Cook, a fellow at the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland in Australia. He and his co-authors examined 11,944 abstracts of climate science reports published from 1991 to 2011. Two-thirds of the abstracts didn’t express any opinion about whether man-made global warming was occurring. But among the roughly 4,000 studies that did, 97.1 percent of them "endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming," the report says. Cook also asked a sample of 1,200 authors of the climate reports to rate their own papers and say whether their research agreed that global warming was man-made. The result was that 97.2 percent of the papers that expressed an opinion about man-made global warming backed the position that it’s caused by human activity. Cook’s methodology has been criticized. Tol study Richard Tol, a professor with the Institute for Environmental Studies in Amsterdam, rejects the 97 percent figure. In a 2014 article, he said it was based on an unrepresentative sample of climate science papers that took into account only one-quarter of the climate research available. Tol had other misgivings about the Australian researcher’s methodology. In re-running the figures, Tol found that some 91 percent of climate research papers that Cook’s team examined supported the consensus that man is the main reason for the Earth’s warming temperatures. Despite taking aim at the specificity of the 97 percent figure, Tol said he agrees there indeed is a large consensus that warming temperatures are the result of human activity. "There is no doubt in my mind that the literature on climate change overwhelmingly supports the hypothesis that climate change is caused by humans," Tol wrote. "I have very little reason to doubt that the consensus is indeed correct. Cook et al., however, failed to demonstrate this." In a reply, Cook re-examined the data and stood by his paper’s conclusions in a 2014 post on his blog, Skeptical Science. University of Illinois study Beyond this debate, NASA also cites a January 2009 study by researchers at the University of Illinois. They surveyed 3,146 earth scientists and asked two questions: Was global warming occurring? Was human activity a "significant contributing factor" for changes in the Earth’s temperatures? Nine out of 10 of the scientists said the Earth’s temperatures had risen, and 82 percent said human activities were a key reason. Winnowing the field to climate change researchers who actively published their results, the survey found that 75 of 77 of them, or 97.4 percent, said human activity is a significant driver of climate change. That latter figure also has come under criticism because of its small sample size. National Academy of Sciences Another study published in 2010 by the National Academy of Sciences created a database of 908 climate researchers who had their work published at least 20 times in scientific journals. The study found roughly 90 percent of the climate researchers were convinced that rising temperatures are being caused by human activity, while 10 percent were not convinced. But the more expertise the researchers had, the greater their consensus. Looking at the top 200 researchers, based on the number of articles they published, just 2.5 percent of them were unconvinced climate change was mostly the result of human activity, the study found. That left "97–98% of the climate researchers most actively publishing in the field surveyed" convinced that rising temperatures were mostly due to humans, the report said. Conversely, the study found that the expertise of researchers who weren’t convinced of man-made global warming was "substantially below that of the convinced researchers." Bill Anderegg, the PNAS report’s lead author, told us in an email that "the quote from (Beyer) is absolutely consistent with the scientific literature on this." We also found a 2013 poll of roughly 1,800 meteorologists by the American Meteorological Society found that 73 percent of those surveyed felt that humans contributed to global warming. But for the more active publishing climate science experts within that group, 93 percent believed that humans were contributing to global warming. Our ruling Beyer said "over 97 percent of the scientific community" believe humans are contributing to climate change. The studies Beyer and others cite do not reflect the scientific community at large. They are surveys that focus on the conclusions of climatologists, earth scientists and meteorologists. The studies found that overwhelming majorities of these experts - sometimes, but not always as high as 97 percent - say humans are contributing to global warming. Beyer’s statement is credible but needs elaboration. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Don Beyer	None	None	None	2016-04-04T00:00:00	2016-03-24	['None']
pomt-00081	Says Claire McCaskill "voted against including health records in the background check system."	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2018/nov/01/josh-hawley/hawley-claim-stretches-mccaskill-record-gun-backgr/	Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley told Missouri residents on live television that U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill voted against the inclusion of mental health records in gun background checks. "The (national background check system) doesn’t work that well because there’s a giant loophole right in the middle of it. It doesn’t include mental health records," Hawley said during the second Senate debate. "Congress could have done this, they’ve had the chance to do it, but they haven’t." "Sen. McCaskill voted against including health records in the background check system. I think that was wrong," Hawley said. "I know it was along the party line, but I think that was wrong." We’ve fact-checked other politicians’ statements on gun control legislation in the past, including some specifically related to firearm access for people with a history of mental illness. McCaskill has received an "F" rating from the National Rifle Association and taken $156,949 from gun control political action committees this election cycle, according to the nonprofit, nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. McCaskill maintained during the debate that she supports and has voted for universal background checks. So has she or hasn’t she voted against including mental health records as part of the gun-purchasing background check process? What McCaskill hasn’t voted for Hawley’s evidence for McCaskill’s disapproval of including mental health records in the background check system was her vote against a 2016 amendment to the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2016. Sponsored by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, the proposal was one of four that came in the wake of a mass shooting at an Orlando nightclub, where a gunman killed 49 people. Grassley’s 2016 amendment would have incentivized states to submit relevant mental health records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. "The Democrats put the kibosh on a bill that, on its face, would have strengthened (to some degree) populating NICS database with names of persons ineligible to purchase guns on account of a mental illness disqualifier," said Jacob James, a professor of constitutional law and director of the Center for Research in Crime and Justice at New York University, in an email. James said that Grassley’s amendment likely didn’t pass muster with Democrats like McCaskill "because they favored a stronger gun control bill, which had no chance of passage." Indeed, some of the leading opponents of the amendment said at the time that it did not go far enough in keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and suspected terrorists. "It was dangerous and reckless," said Jonas Oransky, legal director for Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control organization that rallied against the amendment. Oransky called it a decoy to meaningful gun control legislation that would have "invalidated hundreds of thousands of existing mental health records already in the background check system." Representatives from gun rights advocacy groups, including the National Rifle Association, which backed Grassley’s amendment, did not immediately respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment. The 2016 vote was similar to a failed 2013 measure co-sponsored by Grassley and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. McCaskill voted against that one, too. What McCaskill has voted for McCaskill voted in favor of an amendment to the Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013. Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., sponsored the piece, which would have expanded background checks to gun shows and internet sales, and allotted grants "to improve the automation and transmittal of mental health records and criminal history dispositions." It also would have created a commission of experts charged with studying mass violence, including the role of mental health issues. The Manchin-Toomey amendment died in a Senate filibuster. In 2016, as McCaskill voted no on the Grassley amendment, she voted yes on another amendment co-sponsored by Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., known as the Fix Gun Checks Act of 2016. Its purpose was to ensure that "all individuals who should be prohibited from buying a firearm are listed in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and require a background check for every firearm sale." Though it, too, failed to pass, the amendment also included guidelines on how to define and include relevant mental health records in the national background check system. "Sen. McCaskill has consistently and repeatedly supported legislation to improve the federal background check system," said Max Samis, press secretary for gun control Brady Campaign and Center to Prevent Gun Violence.* Samis along with McCaskill’s campaign noted McCaskill’s co-sponsorship of a bill called the Fix NICS ACT of 2017, which aims to incentivize states to submit relevant records to the nationwide criminal background check system. After a gunman murdered 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Florida, last February, McCaskill joined other members of Congress in saying that proposal was a start, she saw a need for gun legislation that went further. "It’s an important little step, but surely we can do more than the teeniest, tiniest steps right now," McCaskill told Politico earlier this year. Our ruling Hawley said McCaskill "voted against including (mental) health records in the background check system." Hawley is isolating one vote from a GOP proposal while ignoring McCaskill’s full record in the Senate. McCaskill clearly has supported efforts to tighten restrictions for who can purchase a firearm, including measures that clearly addressed the inclusion of mental health records in the gun background check system and more aggressive overall provisions for regulating gun sales.

Smart drum lines are a new technology, untested in the Australian environment. But the traditional drum lines upon which smart drum lines are based are proven to reduce the incidence of shark attack. Although some of the available evidence relates to joint use of drum lines and nets, it cannot be said with certainty that the smart drum lines will not make the beach safer. Smart drum lines do result in shark deaths and put other marine life at risk, although they also allow the possibility of officers attending to set free animals that have been caught. And as Mr Kennedy acknowledged in the same interview, the threat to wildlife from drum lines is less than that of the nets already deployed in NSW.

pomt-07556	Says the Southwest Florida Water Management District has $850 million in reserves, enough money in savings to run without levying taxes for more than two years.	false	/florida/statements/2011/apr/01/jd-alexander/senate-budget-chief-criticizes-water-management-di/	Here's a new one: The Senate budget committee chairman says the water management district that includes the Tampa Bay area is so overflowing with money that it could run for two years without collecting a dollar more in taxes. Sen. J.D. Alexander, R-Lake Wales, is making the claim as part of his proposal to fold the Southwest Florida Water Management District budget -- along with the budgets of the four other water management districts -- into the general state budget. "When I see $850 million, half of which is not reserved for anything, and we've essentially allowed them to collect taxes on people when they really didn't need the money, I don't understand that," Alexander told reporters on March 29, 2011. On March 31, Alexander made a similar claim, telling members of the Senate budget committee that the Southwest Florida Water Management District has $850 million in "reserves." The talk about the water management district stuck out to several people, who asked us if it could be true. Specifically we wanted to know: Does the Southwest Florida Water Management District, or Swiftmud, have enough money to operate for more than two years without levying taxes? The state's five water management districts generally operate independently, but their governing boards are appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate, and the governor must approve water management district budgets each year. Alexander wants more control over district budgets to potentially lower the property taxes they collect, and to provide additional oversight of the taxing entities. Alexander's office began requesting detailed financial information from Swiftmud a few weeks ago, said David Rathke, the district's legislative affairs director. The water management district covers 16 counties surrounding the Tampa Bay area and operates with a budget of about $280 million. Of that, about $160 million comes from property taxes, and about $76 million was carried over from previous years' budgets. The rest of the budget, around $44 million, is comprised of local, state and federal funds. On top of that, the water management district has separate pots of money for different types of projects and for future planning, said Rathke, Swiftmud spokeswoman Robyn Felix and finance director Daryl Pokrana. • $298 million set aside to fulfill outstanding contracts. • $78 million allocated for specific projects where contracts have not yet been finalized. • $182 million reserved for future projects that have neither been identified nor approved. Adding in the yearly $280 million budget brings the total to $838 million, or approximately the $850 million Alexander is talking about. The problem with Alexander's claim is that most of the money is obligated to ongoing projects or part of the district's yearly budget. Or it will soon become obligated as part of contracts for projects. They're not reserves in the way most people would think about it. "A lot of these projects are multiyear projects," Pokrana said. The water management district may look like it has a lot of money, he said, in part because it has no debt and does not issue bonds to finance projects. Some of the money set aside is funding a pipeline project that would transfer reclaimed water from the city of Lakeland to the Tampa Electric Company so it could be used for the electric company's operations instead of drinking water, Felix said. Other funds are being allocated for a restoration project in Sawgrass Lake in Pinellas County and to create a wetland treatment system on Lake Hancock in Polk County. Alexander said Swiftmud could forgo property tax collections for more than two years -- which would mean giving up at least $320 million in tax revenues (the annual amount the district collects multiplied by two). But the math doesn't add up. The district could bottom out $182 million in long-term planning and project funding. And it could postpone or cancel anticipated contracts for projects, freeing up an additional $78 million. But that adds up to only $260 million. The rest of the money is either part of Swiftmud's annual budget or being used to fund current, ongoing contracts. Alexander was trying to make the point that Swiftmud's bank account needs pruning. The district does have $182 million stored away to be used for future projects. But Alexander has overstated the issue by saying the Southwest Florida Water Management District has enough money in savings to run without levying taxes for more than two years.

pomt-07860	"Massachusetts public schools teach kids as young as kindergartners about gay marriage."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/feb/10/national-organization-marriage/national-organization-marriage-says-massachusetts-/	In early January, just days after Lincoln Chafee replaced Donald Carcieri as governor of Rhode Island, advocates on both sides of the same-sex marriage debate ramped up their annual battle. This year, the fight is taking on new intensity because, while Carcieri vowed for eight years to veto any bill to legalize gay marriage, Chafee supports it. Recently, a leading opponent, the National Organization for Marriage, mailed brochures throughout the state that included the headline: "Imposing same-sex marriage has consequences." The brochure listed four "real consequences" of "redefining marriage to a genderless institution." We chose to examine one of the claims: "Massachusetts’ public schools teach kids as young as kindergartners about gay marriage. Parents have no legal right to object!" We contacted Christopher C. Plante, executive director of the Rhode Island chapter of NOM, who told us that many schools in Massachusetts -- where same-sex marriage has been legal since 2004 -- have books on the subject in their libraries.The "poster child," he said, is a picture book called "King & King," by Linda de Haan and Stern Nijland. The book tells the story of a queen who decided it was time for her son, the prince, to marry. He rejects every princess she offers. Finally the last candidate enters, and the prince feels "a stir in his heart." But it was for the princess’s brother, Prince Lee. The two marry, and the book says "everyone lives happily ever after." On the last page, the two princes kiss, with a red heart covering their mouths. The book "glorifies the idea that it’s perfectly OK to have same-sex marriage," said Plante. And he said the courts have ruled that the educational system has a duty to "normalize" same-sex marriage for grades as low as kindergarten. Asked for examples of where the book is taught to kindergartners, Plante offered just one location, Lexington, Mass., where it became an issue in 2006. That year, two couples -- David and Tonia Parker and Robert and Robin Wirthlin -- filed a federal lawsuit against Lexington school officials. The suit alleged that the Parkers’ son was given a book in kindergarten that depicts various forms of families, including one with parents of the same gender. And, the suit said, when the Wirthlins’ son was in first grade, he was read another book, "King & King," in school. The parents said they have religious beliefs that homosexuality is immoral and that marriage is a holy union only of a man and a woman. They alleged school officials were attempting to indoctrinate their children with the belief that same sex marriages are moral. In 2007, The U.S. District Court in Massachusetts dismissed the parents’ claims, finding that parents don’t have the right to restrict what a public school may teach their children, even if the teachings contradict the parents’ religious beliefs. The parents appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit but lost. The appeals court wrote: "There is no allegation here of a formalized curriculum requiring students to read many books affirming gay marriage. The reading by a teacher of one book, or even three, and even if to a young and impressionable child, does not constitute "indoctrination." Asked for any other examples of gay marriage being taught to kindergartners, Plante referred us to Kris Mineau, executive director of the Massachusetts Family Institute, which describes itself as "dedicated to strengthening the family and affirming the Judeo-Christian values upon which it is based." Mineau said he has been fighting same-sex marriage advocates for eight years and he is certain their message is being spread in schools throughout Massachusetts. But he acknowledged he could not cite any examples other than Lexington. "I don’t have documentation of everything going on," Mineau said. "It’s very difficult to quantify." Mineau also said the 2007 court rulings discouraged other parents from officially complaining about their children being exposed to school programs endorsing same-sex marriage. We looked for other evidence that Massachusetts schools are teaching kindergartners about same-sex marriage. We asked Jonathan Considine, spokesman for the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, if the state mandated curriculum on same-sex marriage for kindergartners. The answer is no, he said. Massachusetts is a local control state, so each district decides on what topics to cover. He said, "Massachusetts does not require that students in any grade be taught about gay marriage." He said many schools have used books or promoted discussions to teach tolerance because some students have same-sex parents and there are teachers with same-sex spouses. Considine referred us to The Massachusetts Comprehensive Health Curriculum, which includes a standard that by fifth grade, students should be able to define sexual orientation, such as heterosexual, gay and lesbian. It makes no recommendations about teaching different types of marriages to kindergartners. Then we called the Massachusetts Teachers Association, which represents 107,000 educators. Laura Bennett, a spokeswoman for the association, said she does not know whether anyone is discussing same-sex marriages with kindergartners in any of the state’s hundreds of school districts. But she is relatively certain no one else has publicly complained. "I work on communications with teachers, and if there were other cases, I would have heard," she said. "There’s just that one case, over and over again." "I haven’t heard boo about this," added Thomas Gosnell, president of the American Federation of Teachers Massachusetts, which represents most of the other educators in the state. "I have not heard one of my members tell me they are talking about gay marriage in kindergarten. They are probably not talking about any kind of marriage in that grade. "I don’t even hear anyone talking about gay marriage anymore," he added. "It’s just there." Bottom line: The National Organization for Marriage mailing says that Massachusetts public schools teach kindergartners about gay marriage. The wording, including the present tense verb, gives the impression this is happening now, in many schools. But the group’s only evidence is two incidents five years ago. It’s possible that somewhere, in one of the 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts, other kindergartners have been taught about same-sex marriage. But NOM couldn’t cite any other examples. We find its statement False.	None	National Organization for Marriage	None	None	None	2011-02-10T00:00:01	2011-02-05	['None']

pomt-11872	Says HIV and AIDS rates have spiked "due to increased heroin and fentanyl use."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/31/edward-markey/sen-ed-markey-says-hivaids-have-spiked-due-fentany/	Democratic Sen. Edward J. Markey said that the Trump administration’s plan to use funds from HIV and AIDS programs to fight the opioid addiction crisis is unsound. Specifically, the Massachusetts senator said that increased opioid abuse has led to an increase in HIV and AIDS. The administration’s Oct. 26 declaration of the opioid epidemic as a national public health emergency allows flexibility in the use of resources in HIV and AIDS programs to allow people eligible for those programs to get substance abuse treatment. "The administration’s proposal to reallocate funding from HIV/AIDS programs to the opioid crisis is robbing Peter to pay Paul, especially as HIV and AIDS rates spike due to increased heroin and fentanyl use," Markey said in an Oct. 26 statement. We wanted to know if increased use of heroin and fentanyl have led to increased rates of HIV and AIDS. We found some truth to Markey’s claim but not enough national data to fully back it. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told us it does not have data specific to heroin and fentanyl, and estimates that HIV and AIDs diagnoses have declined in recent years among people who inject drugs. Still, there are risks associated with opioid injections and HIV transmissions, as was the case in an Indiana county. U.S. opioid epidemic, transmitted diseases More than 64,000 people died in 2016 from drug overdoses, the majority linked to opioids, which include the synthetic opioid fentanyl and the illicit drug heroin, according to the CDC. Increased availability, a relatively low price and the high purity of heroin in the United States are driving increased use of heroin, the CDC said. Fentanyl use, including illicitly-made fentanyl, has also increased in recent years. People who inject drugs are at risk for infectious diseases that can be transmitted through used needles and syringes. Human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, is most commonly acquired or transmitted through sexual behaviors and needle or syringe use. If not treated, HIV can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS. The CDC’s HIV Surveillance Report, 2015, noted that HIV and AIDS diagnoses tied to injection drug use declined from 2010 to 2015. The report did not specify diagnoses by types of drugs injected. From 2008 to 2014, estimated annual HIV infections among people who inject drugs declined 56 percent (from 3,900 to 1,700), according to February 2017 data from the CDC. That report did not include AIDS data. HIV outbreak in southeastern Indiana Experts we reached said they were not aware of reports showing a national spike in HIV and AIDS among injection drug users, but noted that data collection and reporting tends to lag. "It is very possible that increased HIV transmission due to fentanyl and/or heroin use is occurring" but have not yet been identified through HIV testing and screening or have not yet been reported to CDC, said Brandon Marshall, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Brown University School of Public Health. When we contacted Markey’s office, they highlighted reports about HIV spikes in Scott County. Scott County historically had fewer than five cases of HIV infection reported annually, CDC reported. By April 21, 2015, Indiana officials had diagnosed HIV in 135 people in a small community within Scott County. Most of them reported injection drug use with oxymorphone as their drug of choice, said CDC’s May 2015 report, adding that some reported injecting heroin. Since early 2015, at least 191 people had tested positive for HIV in Scott County, the Indiana State Department of Health said in April 2016. "The outbreak in Scott County turned a floodlight on the intertwined nature of opioid use, HIV, and (hepatitis C virus) … It’s possible that the opioid epidemic could already be having a similar impact in other communities," said a June blog post by Richard Wolitski, director of the office of HIV/AIDS and Infectious Disease Policy at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. A CDC analysis published November 2016 found that at least 220 counties in 26 states are "potentially vulnerable" to HIV and hepatitis C infections among persons who inject drugs "in the context of the national opioid epidemic." Our ruling Markey said, HIV and AIDS rates have spiked "due to increased heroin and fentanyl use." There are risks for HIV transmission among people who share needles and syringes to inject opioids. An Indiana county recently had an HIV outbreak linked to the injection of opioids, including heroin. At least 220 U.S. counties may be at risk of similar outbreaks. But the CDC said it does not have national data addressing Markey’s heroin and fentanyl claim, and estimates that HIV and AIDs diagnoses have declined in recent years among people who inject drugs. Markey’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-07398	Rep. Paul Ryan’s Medicare plan "lines the pockets of the private insurance companies," increases costs for seniors and does not reduce the deficit.	half-true	/virginia/statements/2011/apr/30/gerry-connolly/gerry-connolly-says-gop-medicare-plan-would-line-p/	Rep. Paul Ryan’s recent proposal to overhaul Medicare opened a round of partisan debate over how to control the costs of popular entitlement programs that are driving the U.S. deep into debt. The plan, part of the House GOP’s 2012 budget, passed the chamber with no Democratic support. Although it is certain to die in the Senate or on Obama’s desk, Ryan’s effort to reduce the government’s role in providing health insurance to seniors is likely to remain an issue in the 2012 elections. Ryan, R-Wis., is chairman of the House Budget Committee. Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Democrat from Fairfax County, recently assailed Ryan’s plan to privatize much of Medicare. Under the proposal, seniors would buy private insurance policies and Uncle Sam would make a fixed payment to insurers to help cover the plans. The system would start in 2022 for everyone who is 65 or younger that year. "Not one dollar of the increased costs to seniors would be used to reduce the deficit," Connolly said in a press release. "Instead, the Republican plan lines the pockets of the private insurance companies." Are Connolly’s comments true? George Burke, Connolly’s communications director, said the claim was based on projections from the Congressional Budget Office that Ryan’s plan would require seniors to pay more for health coverage but not really reduce government expenses. He said the plan "lines the pockets" of insurers because seniors would have to buy private insurance, something they don’t have to do now. First, let’s discuss how Ryan’s plan would work. Under the legislation, people who turn 65 after 2022 would get a "premium support payment" from Medicare, paid directly to an insurer they select towards the cost of buying private health insurance. The payment is projected to be about $8,000 in 2022 for someone turning 65 that year. As people grow older, the subsidy would increase. That’s because health care costs increase with age. Ryan’s plan would raise the baseline payment each year by the increase in the Consumer Price Index. That would allow the payment to keep up with overall inflation, although medical costs have been climbing much faster than total inflation. One result, the CBO said, would be that future Medicare recipients "would pay more for their health care than they would pay under the current Medicare system." Let’s go back to Connolly now. We’ll start by addressing the second part of his claim, that requiring seniors to buy private health insurance would "line the pockets" of private insurers. Although Connolly’s language might be dramatic, he’s right about the basic detail. If Americans over 65 start buying private insurance, with their own money or with government funds, total premium levels will climb for private health insurers. And because the largest health insurance companies are publicly traded and seek profits, it is a good bet that they won’t offer money-losing Medicare plans. The insurers would have to meet standards set by the federal government, however. They would have to charge the same premium to everyone who is the same age, and could not deny coverage to seniors based on pre-existing health conditions. The Ryan plan would provide higher insurance subsidies to low-income people; those in the top 8 percent of earnings would receive smaller government payments. So Connolly’s right on part of his claim. The Ryan plan would increase revenues from premiums revenues at private insurers. We won’t pass judgment on whether this is "lining the pockets" of these companies, since there is little chance of predicting what profit margins would be like under these plans in 10 years. Now let’s examine Connolly’s claim that "not one dollar of the increased costs to seniors would be used to reduce the deficit." As we mentioned, the CBO believes that seniors would pay more from their own pockets for health care under Ryan’s plan. So the increased costs to seniors makes sense. But as Joe Antos, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute points out, if seniors have to pay more, government should end up paying less. The CBO estimates that health costs would be higher under the Ryan plan than under traditional Medicare for a 65-year-old in 2022. The reason for the increase, it says, is that "both administrative costs (including profits) and payment rates to providers are higher for private plans than for Medicare." Antos and Marc Goldwein, an economist at the non-partisan New America Foundation, said the government’s premium payments under the Ryan plan would grow more slowly than Medicare’s expenses under the current set-up. So while there may be little savings initially, over time the government’s share of Medicare spending would fall. Those savings would be available for other programs, including deficit reduction. Antos also said the payments would encourage health insurers and providers to economize because seniors would not have blank checks to pay for tests and treatments. Health-care insurers and providers would have incentive to "increase profits through more efficient care, delivered in a more efficient manner." Paul Van de Water at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities used the CBO information and his own calculations to estimate the cost difference between Ryan’s plan and the current system. Under the current system, Van de Water says a typical 65-year-old pays $6,150 for premiums and out-of-pocket costs on Medicare and supplemental coverage. The government pays about $8,600. In 2022, he said, a 65-year-old would see out-of-pocket costs double to $12,500, while the government’s share of costs would fall by $600, to $8,000. So while the government would see some savings, Ryan’s plan "increases the total health costs for beneficiaries by vastly more than it reduces the federal government’s spending," Van de Water said. Dean Baker, another left-leaning economist, said the plan could save the government money over time, but only at the cost of much higher payments from seniors. He, like Van de Water and the CBO, said using private insurers will mean higher costs and more inefficiencies. Those inefficiencies cost money. Let’s review: The liberal economists don’t like Ryan’s plan and say it would harm seniors, but they concede it would lead to lower government spending on health care costs, at least over time. That contradicts Connolly’s assertion that no money from these increased costs would help pay down the deficit. It’s true that the new payments by seniors would go towards private insurers, but savings from lower government spending could go towards deficit reductions. We rate Connolly’s claim Half True.

pomt-11565	Says the Steele dossier "was—according to (James Comey's) June 2017 testimony—'salacious and unverified.' "	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/feb/05/devin-nunes/nunes-memo-twists-james-comeys-words-steele-dossie/	The memo assembled by aides to House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., has spawned lots of debate, both before it was released on Feb. 2 and afterward. One small portion of the memo, however, has attracted special scrutiny from experts and pundits: how former FBI Director James Comey characterized the "Steele Dossier" under oath to Congress. The memo suggests that Comey had said the Steele dossier was bunk in its entirety. But that’s not what Comey said. The dossier in question was compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele on behalf of Fusion GPS, a research firm whose work had been funded in part by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. It describes some of Donald Trump’s trips to Russia, before he became president, describing who he interacted with and things he did there. The Nunes memo recounts the history of the dossier leading up to Trump taking office before concluding, "in early January 2017, Director Comey briefed President-elect Trump on a summary of the Steele dossier, even though it was—according to his June 2017 testimony—'salacious and unverified.' " What we’re looking at in this fact-check is whether Comey actually said that the Steele dossier was "salacious and unverified." The Nunes memo is effectively leveraging Comey’s credibility -- as someone who was fired by President Donald Trump, thus not a strong supporter of the president -- to undercut the dossier. The House Intelligence Committee did not respond to an inquiry for this article. What we found in the public record suggests a more limited assertion under oath by Comey -- that he’d said portions of the memo were "salacious and unverified," not the whole thing. (We owe a debt in this fact-check to writings by two conservative blogs, RedState and HotAir.) We found a few relevant portions of Comey’s testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee on June 8, 2017. One came from his prepared testimony: "I first met then-President-Elect Trump on Friday, January 6 in a conference room at Trump Tower in New York. I was there with other Intelligence Community (IC) leaders to brief him and his new national security team on the findings of an IC assessment concerning Russian efforts to interfere in the election. At the conclusion of that briefing, I remained alone with the President-Elect to brief him on some personally sensitive aspects of the information assembled during the assessment. "The IC leadership thought it important, for a variety of reasons, to alert the incoming President to the existence of this material, even though it was salacious and unverified. Among those reasons were: (1) we knew the media was about to publicly report the material and we believed the IC should not keep knowledge of the material and its imminent release from the President-Elect; and (2) to the extent there was some effort to compromise an incoming President, we could blunt any such effort with a defensive briefing." In this passage, Comey seems to apply the terms "salacious and unverified" to "this material," which in turn refers to the earlier reference to "some personally sensitive aspects of the information assembled during the assessment." At the very least, this passage doesn’t suggest it’s a slam dunk that the entire dossier is "salacious and unverified." It refers to "some potentially sensitive aspects" of the dossier. One instance in which Comey repeated the phrase "salacious and unverified" came during an exchange with Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine: Collins: "I want first to ask you about your conversations with the president, three conversations in which you told him that he was not under investigation. The first was during your January 6th meeting, according to your testimony, in which it appears that you actually volunteered that assurance. ... Did you limit that statement to counterintelligence investigations, or were you talking about any FBI investigation?" Comey: "I didn't use the term counterintelligence. I was briefing him about salacious and unverified material. It was in a context of that that he had a strong and defensive reaction about that not being true." Comey’s language here ("material") is more opaque, but we don’t see any clear indication that he’s talking about the whole dossier as being "salacious and unverified." A third excerpt came in a remark to Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., when Comey referred to "unverified and salacious parts" of the dossier. Note Comey’s use of word "parts," rather than the whole dossier. A final relevant passage came during an exchange with the committee’s chairman, Richard Burr, R-N.C. Burr: "At the time of your departure from the FBI, was the FBI able to confirm any criminal allegations contained in the Steele document?" Comey: "Mr. Chairman, I don't think that's a question I can answer in an open setting because it goes into the details of the investigation." If the dossier in its entirety were total bunk, there would have been no need for Comey to suggest meeting Burr in a closed session. The fact that Comey suggests meeting in a place where intelligence can be discussed is an indication that the dossier included at least some sensitive information. We asked several experts whether they thought the memo had overplayed its hand about what Comey had said, and they largely agreed. "I took Comey’s testimony to be saying that there was ‘salacious and unverified material’ in the Steele dossier, but he does not claim that the entire dossier is salacious and unverified," said Molly Bishop Shadel, a University of Virginia law professor and former U.S. Justice Department attorney who practiced before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. "Could there be a world in which the entire dossier is salacious and unverified? Yes. Is that what Mr. Comey said in his testimony? No. By being inexact in his language, Mr. Nunes has misrepresented Mr. Comey’s testimony." Michael C.H. McDaniel, director of homeland security law programs at Western Michigan University’s Thomas M. Cooley Law School, said Comey’s carefully phrased words make the Nunes memo’s interpretation dubious. "I fully believe that Comey was referring to some of the facts in one of the memos that comprise the Steele dossier as being yet unverified, just as only portions appeared salacious," McDaniel said. "Any other interpretation is convoluted and illogical." Liza Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center’s National Security Program at New York University Law School, agreed. "Comey’s testimony does not clearly indicate that the entire dossier was salacious and unverified," she said. "It seems quite possible he was referring merely to particular parts of the dossier that would have especially raised Trump’s hackles, leading Comey to offer the assurance that Trump wasn’t under investigation." Our ruling The Nunes memo said the Steele dossier "was—according to (Comey's) June 2017 testimony—'salacious and unverified.' " Comey's careful phrasings in four portions of his testimony indicate that he meant only that portions of it were "salacious and unverified." The memo twists Comey’s words in an effort to leverage his stature to undercut the dossier. We rate the memo’s characterization of Comey’s past statements Half True.

pomt-12770	Says Michelle Obama "said she was never proud of her country til they elected her husband POTUS."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/feb/23/david-clarke-jr/david-clarke-says-michelle-obama-said-she-was-prou/	Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr., a big enough supporter of President Donald Trump that he has been mentioned for a role in the administration, has been a frequent basher of former President Barack Obama. On Feb. 17, 2017, he turned to attacking the former first lady. "Michelle Obama said she was never proud of her country til they elected her husband POTUS," Clarke charged on Twitter: "I've never been prouder since we got rid of him." With the tweet was a photo of Clarke, who is being encouraged by some to run against U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., in 2018. Flexing his biceps, Clarke is shown wearing a T-shirt with an image of Trump standing on a tank and holding a rifle. During Obama’s first presidential campaign, Obama did take some flack for remarks she made in Wisconsin about being proud of her country. Let’s see whether Clarke is accurately describing what she said. Two Wisconsin speeches Obama campaigned for her husband in Milwaukee and Madison on Feb. 18, 2008, the day before Wisconsin’s primary. He had won eight consecutive Democratic primaries and caucuses over Hillary Clinton. In Milwaukee, Michelle Obama said: People in this country are ready for change and hungry for a different kind of politics and … for the first time in my adult life I am proud of my country because it feels like hope is finally making a comeback. But remarks she made later in Madison were the ones that gained widespread media attention. Several minutes into her speech, Obama noted her husband’s primary victory in South Carolina and continued by saying: And then he went on to win throughout the country. And when’s the last time we’ve seen a candidate -- male, female, whatever party -- who has been able to pull together victories that included Utah and Idaho and Louisiana and Maine and Washington and Illinois. I don’t think we’ve seen that. But what we’ve learned over this year is that hope is making a comeback. It is making a comeback and let me tell you something: For the first time in my adult lifetime, I’m really proud of my country and not just because Barack has done well, but because I think people are hungry for change. And I have been desperate to see our country moving in that direction and just not feeling so alone in my frustration and disappointment. I’ve seen people who are hungry to be unified around some basic common issues and it’s made me proud. So, Obama’s remark was made before her husband had won the Democratic nomination and nine months before was elected president. And Obama said she was proud because Americans were hungry for change, not just because her husband was winning. But her statement was controversial. Asked the day after the Wisconsin primary, which her husband won, if she wanted to clarify her remarks, Obama said: What I was clearly talking about was that I'm proud in how Americans are engaging in the political process. For the first time in my lifetime, I'm seeing people rolling up their sleeves in a way that I haven't seen and really trying to figure this out -- and that's the source of pride that I was talking about. Bill Kristol, editor-at-large of the conservative Weekly Standard magazine, said at the time that Obama’s original comment "was sort of revealing," adding: She was an adult when we won the Cold War without firing a shot. She was an adult for the last 25 years of economic progress, social progress ….I don’t think the American people think on the whole that the last 25 years of American history is a narrative of despair and nothing to be proud of. CNN included the key part of Obama’s remark -- "For the first time in my adult lifetime, I'm really proud of my country, and not just because Barack has done well, but because I think people are hungry for change" -- in a documentary on her that aired in January 2017. That clip was followed by David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Obama, saying: Those kinds of moments gave you a heartburn. By the same token, it became clear to me very quickly that we had failed her, because we threw her out there without adequate staffing, without adequate preparation. For his part, Clarke didn’t provide us any information to back his claim. The sheriff’s office spokeswoman told us the sheriff said: "Go suck an egg" and that when he does provide us evidence of his claims, PolitiFact Wisconsin "still finds a way to contort a way to say false." Our rating Clarke says Obama "said she was never proud of her country til they elected her husband POTUS." He provided us and we could find no evidence of such a statement. What Obama said -- nine months before her husband was elected president -- was that for the first time in her adult life, she was proud of her country not just because Barack Obama had done well in pursuing the presidential nomination, but also "because I think people are hungry for change."

pomt-10513	McCain and Bush are millionaires who are "for tax cuts for millionaires."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/17/campaign-defend-america/both-millionaires-mccain-supports-bushs-cuts/	An ad goes after Sen. John McCain for being just like President George W. Bush, hitting McCain on Iraq, oil companies and health care. It also criticizes him on tax policy. "A millionaire who's for tax cuts for millionaires. McSame as Bush," the ad states. It's true that Bush and McCain are both millionaires, with McCain being somewhat wealthier. Bush's net worth in 2006 was between $7.6-million and $20.1-million, based on his personal financial disclosures required by law and analyzed by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. McCain, meanwhile, is worth somewhere between $27.8-million and $45-million. (Sen. Hillary Clinton's net worth is between $10.4-million and $51-million, while Sen. Barack Obama's is between $456,012 and $1.1-million.) So McCain and Bush are both millionaires, and that part of the statement is correct. We couldn't find any proposals John McCain supports that offer new tax cuts for millionaires, so we suspect this is a reference to McCain's support of the Bush tax cuts. Bush's tax cuts lowered rates across the board for those who pay federal income taxes, so they benefited both millionaire and nonmillionaire taxpayers. But data compiled from the Congressional Budget Office indicate that millionaires saw the most sizable drops to their tax rates measured as a share of income. Those tax cuts will expire during the next presidential administration unless Congress acts to keep them in place. McCain actually opposed the Bush tax cuts before changing his mind and supporting them now. He said the reason for his change of heart is that rescinding the tax cuts would be the equivalent of a tax increase after they had been in effect for so long. (Both Obama and Clinton want to roll back the Bush tax cuts for higher incomes.) If you're trying to identify the candidate who supports the Bush tax cuts, McCain is your man. But we're concerned that the ad leaves the impression that McCain advocates new, additional tax cuts for millionaires rather than keeping the present situation in place. For that reason, we knock this claim down one peg on the Truth-O-Meter and find it Mostly True.

pomt-00621	Austin school district "teachers are the lowest paid of any urban" Texas district and the "lowest paid of any surrounding school district."	half-true	/texas/statements/2015/may/27/gina-hinojosa/gina-hinojosa-says-austin-teachers-lowest-paid-any/	In May 2015, the president of Austin’s school board urged state lawmakers to put billions of additional dollars into school aid. The money should flow to teacher pay, Gina Hinojosa said, adding that teachers in the Austin district have lower salaries than peers elsewhere. Specifically, Hinojosa told Austin American-Statesman reporter Kiah Collier: "Currently our teachers are the lowest paid of any urban, lowest paid of any surrounding school district and we believe that's unacceptable." The lowest among whom? "Amongst all urban districts in the state and amongst surrounding Central Texas school districts," Hinojosa said. Is all of that so? To our inquiry, Hinojosa said she drew on information gathered by the district. District spokesman Reyne Telles then said by email the comparisons appeared in charts (see them here) showing the salaries of teachers with bachelor’s degrees at different years of experience drawn from information posted online by districts. Telles said the district is "confident in the numbers," which were part of a January 2015 staff presentation to the board. Left out of the comparison: Some 1,675 local teachers with master’s or doctoral degrees who, a district chart indicates, accounted for 29 percent of the district’s 5,842 teachers in 2014-15. By email, a district official, Michael Houser, said the teachers with advanced degrees earned $862 more than other Austin teachers. He said he believes that stipend trailed comparable payments made by the district’s Texas competitors. At any rate, the presentation that Hinojosa relied on shows some Austin teachers making more than Austin-area peers in 2014-15. But the bulk, more than six in 10 by our calculation, had salaries less than what was paid teachers nearby and in selected urban districts around the state. Houser told us by phone the district did not compare salaries in all urban districts, focusing instead on those other districts where it’s had recruiting success. Similarly, Houser said, the district did not check salaries in every nearby district, focusing on "our most immediate competition." The district’s charts show: --In 2014-15, Austin teachers with five through 30 years of experience were paid less than nearby peers in nearly every instance. Also, those teachers made less than nearly all peers in eight selected urban Texas districts: Cypress-Fairbanks (Harris County), Dallas, El Paso, Fort Bend, Fort Worth, Houston, Northside (Bexar County) and San Antonio. Austin teachers trailed the average pay for teachers in the other districts by $4,422 (for teachers with no experience) to $7,687 (teacher with 10 years’ experience). --In contrast, beginning and very experienced Austin teachers mostly drew more in pay than peers in the nine nearby districts: Del Valle, Eanes, Hays, Lake Travis, Leander, Manor, Pflugerville, Round Rock and San Marcos. That is, Austin teachers with no experience were paid $44,046, which exceeded the salary of comparable teachers in each of the nearby districts by a minimum of $546 up to $2,046. The nearby districts paid teachers with no experience an average of $42,810. --Austin teachers with 35 years of experience earned $3,595 to $6,104 more than teachers in four of the nearby districts though up to $3,605 less than comparable teachers in the five other Austin-area districts. Austin’s $56,595 salary for such teachers ran $1,406 ahead of the average $58,189 pay for such teachers in the nearby districts. Social Security A wrinkle: The district’s charts did not account for money it pays toward Social Security benefits for employees. By phone, Houser told us that’s because what once seemed a recruiting advantage—the district making contributions for Social Security and for pensions through the Teacher Retirement System of Texas—has become an albatross; teachers, Houser said, would prefer to get the district’s Social Security contributions in take-home pay. District spokesman Jacob Barrett said the Austin district is among 47 statewide that long ago committed to backing both benefits. Houser said that if Social Security contributions are folded into the comparisons, Austin’s teachers received more in compensation in 2014-15 than peers in the nearby districts. But Austin’s teachers still saw less compensation than counterparts in the urban districts the district considers peers, he said. We checked this by counting as income the district’s Social Security contributions, 6.2 percent of each employee’s gross pay. After these adjustments, Austin’s teacher salaries at every experience level exceeded the average for the nine nearby districts, with the Austin advantage ranging from $324 a year (for teachers with 25 years’ experience) to $5,101 (teachers with 35 years’ experience). But, as Houser said, counting the contributions as income did not propel Austin’s teachers at any experience level to higher pay than the average salaries of peers in the urban districts Austin uses for comparisons. An unknown: Whether Austin teachers will uniformly participate in Social Security long enough to reap full benefits on retirement. Health insurance We also asked if the Austin district compared health insurance benefits by district. By email, Houser pointed out a chart in the board presentation indicating Austin’s payments of $446.25 a month to cover employee health insurance premiums in 2014-15 were more than what nearly every nearby peer district spent; the Lake Travis district expended $537 a worker. The Austin district’s spending also outpaced expenditures for premiums in most of the urban districts selected as peers; the Houston district was paying $500. Austin generally pays more, Houser indicated, to fund a health plan offering more benefits than, say, the TRS-backed plan for which districts in 2014-15 were paying $325 monthly for employee premiums. Other pay analyses Other pay analyses bore out what we saw in the Austin district’s information. For instance, we asked the Texas Education Agency for its best data on teacher salaries within each district; spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe guided us to an agency website where we punched in district names to reach average base salaries for teachers in 2014-15 (not counting Social Security contributions). By this gauge, the Austin district’s average base teacher salary of $47,476 trailed average base teacher salaries in all but one of the nine nearby districts; the Manor district’s average base teacher salary was $46,093. Our searches indicated Austin’s average base teacher salary was less than the average base teacher salary in a dozen other urban districts. We looked at the Arlington, North East (Bexar County), Socorro and Ysleta districts in addition to the urban districts shown in the Austin district’s charts. TEA considers these added districts, like the Austin district and others, to be "major urban" districts. A district falls into this category if it’s located in a county with a population of at least 840,000; its enrollment is the largest in the county or at least 75 percent of the largest district enrollment in the county; and at least 35 percent of enrolled students are economically disadvantaged. For another take, we turned to the Texas Association of School Boards, which annually surveys districts on salaries. Spokesman Dax Gonzalez emailed us its findings for 2014-15--and the results, also not folding in Social Security contributions, aligned with the Austin district’s charts in that the least experienced and most experienced Austin teachers had higher salaries than peers in nearby districts--but other teachers trailed. Compared to teachers in the major urban districts that the TEA groups with the Austin district, Austin teachers had lower salaries at all experience levels. In the end, Hinojosa didn’t dispute the range of our findings. Still, she said, "we have a real problem in this district paying our employees enough." Our ruling Hinojosa said Austin school district "teachers are the lowest paid of any urban" Texas district and the "lowest paid of any surrounding school district." Hinojosa relied on research not extending to all urban or all nearby districts nor did it roll in teachers with advanced degrees. Those gaps aside, the pay contrasts aren’t entirely clear-cut. Inexperienced and very experienced Austin teachers were paid more in 2014-15 than peers in some or most nearby districts and if you count Social Security contributions, Austin teachers in general were compensated better on average than teachers in nearby districts. On the other hand, all Austin district teachers were paid less than counterparts in comparable urban districts across the state--even after taking into account Social Security contributions. On balance, we rate this claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-09932	Under a public health care option, 120 million Americans will "lose what they now get from private companies and be forced onto the government-run rolls as businesses decide it is more cost-effective for them to drop coverage."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/12/karl-rove/roves-op-ed-distorts-health-study/	Republican strategist Karl Rove argued against the Democrats' blueprint for health care, citing a Lewin Group study about what might happen under a public option for health care. The public option has become shorthand for the government offering an insurance plan to compete with private insurers. Advocates for the public option said it would be an insurer of last resort, such as for people who lose their health insurance when they lose their job. In a column in the Wall Street Journal, Rove said the public option would lead to America "becoming a European-style welfare state." "The Lewin Group estimates 70 percent of people with private insurance — 120 million Americans — will quickly lose what they now get from private companies and be forced onto the government-run rolls as businesses decide it is more cost-effective for them to drop coverage," Rove wrote. "They'd be happy to shift some of the expense — and all of the administration headaches — to Washington. And once the private insurance market has been dismantled it will be gone." The public option "is just phony," Rove wrote. "It's a bait-and-switch tactic meant to reassure people that the president's goals are less radical than they are. Mr. Obama's real aim, as some candid Democrats admit, is a single-payer, government-run health-care system." We'll note that President Barack Obama has said that is not his aim. But we were more interested in Rove's description of the study. The Lewin Group report, which we've looked at before, ran a number of different scenarios on what would happen if the government offered a public option. One scenario was a Medicare-style plan that was open to everyone. Under that type of public option, the government would pay health providers much less than private insurers and offer lower premiums to the public. The study model found that 118 million people would choose to drop their private coverage in favor of cheaper public coverage. (We'll note here that the Lewin Group is respected by many health care analysts and operates with editorial independence, but it is a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, which also offers private health insurance.) But Rove misrepresents the report in a couple of significant ways. First, he neglects to mention that the 120 million number is only for the public option that is most like Medicare, and if everyone were allowed to enroll. That is the most extreme option that could drive the most people from private insurers. But there are other ways to set up a public option health care plan. Under the Lewin Group's estimates, if you restrict a Medicare-style public option only to individuals and small businesses, only 32 million would leave private coverage. And if the public option is less like Medicare and competes more like a private insurer, the number drops further. What a public option might actually look like is one of the biggest questions Congress is grappling with right now. A group of fiscally conservative Democrats known as the Blue Dogs have said they do not support a Medicare-style public option, and have laid out specifics for the kind of public option they would support. They envision a public option that operates more like a private insurer and would only be available as a last resort. Under that type of scenario, the study says the number of people who would switch from private to public insurance could be as low as 21.5 million or 10.4 million. Which brings us to another problem: Rove says people would "be forced" to switch, but the report is modeled on the idea that consumers choose health plans based on price and would opt for a public plan — not be forced into one. Rove's comments give the impression that 120 million people would be booted out of their private insurance and forced to turn to the government. That's not the scenario the report describes. When we've covered this issue before, some of our readers have argued that we're missing the point. If millions of people choose to leave private insurance, the readers say, that would injure the private system to the point that government would have to step in — Rove's "bait and switch" argument. After people leave their private insurance for the public option, it would become too expensive for employers to continue to offer coverage to smaller pools of employees. But that's not how Rove described the report. He said, "The Lewin Group estimates 70 percent of people with private insurance — 120 million Americans — will quickly lose what they now get from private companies and be forced onto the government-run rolls as businesses decide it is more cost-effective for them to drop coverage." That's wrong. The report said that people would choose to leave private insurance if given a cheaper option, but the report provided smaller numbers for other options. The debate in Congress over what a public option will look like is fierce and ongoing. So Rove is picking the worst-case scenario and then distorting the cause and effects. We rate Rove's statement False.	None	Karl Rove	None	None	None	2009-06-12T14:01:30	2009-06-11	['United_States']

pomt-02847	"In Jeanne Shaheen, New Hampshire has a Senator who was the deciding vote to pass Obamacare."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2013/nov/19/jim-rubens/jim-rubens-claims-us-senator-jeanne-shaheen-d-nh-w/	With glitches continuing to hamper the federal health care website that went live in October 2013, a group of Senate Democrats is asking the White House to extend the open enrollment period for people to buy coverage. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and nine others say individuals shouldn’t be penalized for lack of coverage if they can’t get health insurance through the new website, healthcare.gov. They want to push back the March 31, 2014 enrollment deadline to compensate for the technical problems. "Extending this period will give consumers critical time in which to become familiar with the website and choose a plan that is best for them," the senators wrote to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. With Shaheen emerging as a leading voice in favor of extending the enrollment period, her opponents in New Hampshire are seizing the opportunity to remind voters that Shaheen was one of the Democrats who helped usher in the president’s health reform law in 2010. "In Jeanne Shaheen, New Hampshire has a Senator who was the deciding vote to pass Obamacare," wrote Republican Jim Rubens, who plans to challenge Shaheen next year, in a Nov. 4, 2013 email. New Hampshire GOP Chairwoman Jennifer Horn offered the same criticism. She said Shaheen’s call to extend the enrollment period is "too little, too late" and does nothing to address the "burdensome tax increases that Granite Staters will face as a result of the individual mandate." "Senator Jeanne Shaheen was the deciding vote in favor of ObamaCare, and she is the reason why New Hampshire families are dealing with disastrous consequences of this awful law," Horn said. It’s true that Shaheen voted to pass the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. But was she really the "deciding vote" in favor of the law? PolitiFact has seen numerous politicians called "the deciding vote" for Obamacare in the past. In Florida, a campaign ad from the 60 Plus Association attacked Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson for being "the deciding vote" for Obamacare. It was ruled Mostly False. PolitiFact Wisconsin looked at campaign literature from Republican Senate candidate Ron Johnson that claimed Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold "cast the deciding vote" for the health care bill in 2009. The claim earned a rating of Mostly False. In Michigan, a Republican committee said it was Sen. Debbie Stabenow. Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey and Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill have also been credited with casting the "deciding vote." The claims reflect the gamesmanship that every incumbent faces when opponents take a look at the voting record. Rather than just say the senator voted for a bill, the attackers up the ante by declaring it was the single vote that made the difference. In the case of the health care law, there’s a sliver of truth. All of the Democratic senators were needed to pass the bill. One of the key votes happened on Dec. 24, 2009, when 58 Democrats and two independents voted together in favor of the bill. (Sixty votes were needed for a preliminary cloture vote to prevent filibusters; otherwise the final vote couldn’t happen and the bill would have been blocked.) "Any one of those 60 Democrats who voted for it in the U.S. Senate, had they voted no, it would not have passed," Rubens said in an interview. "So any one of those 60 would have been the deciding vote." However, PolitiFact has been unsympathetic to that argument in the past, since calling someone "the deciding vote" implies he or she played a pivotal role, such as withholding support until the last moment. When it comes to the health care law, Shaheen wasn’t a holdout. If any Democratic senator deserves the distinction of clearing the way for the health reform law, it was then-Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska. As was widely reported at the time, Nelson delivered the 60th vote needed to send the bill to the floor of the Senate for a vote. Shaheen’s staff provided a few examples of her public comments in support of health care reform before the vote. "The status quo is simply not sustainable," Shaheen said on Sept. 23, 2009. "Now is the time to act." She repeated her call for health reform in floor speeches on Oct. 1, Dec. 7 and Dec. 14, 2009, saying the bill will begin to address soaring health care costs. Shaheen said years of "perverse incentives" have encouraged doctors to do more procedures rather than practice better medicine, and that the bill will shift the industry away from the fee-for-service model. "The many programs supported in the bill before us move us in the direction of delivery system reform, which is so important to our effort," Shaheen said on Dec. 15. "By promoting innovative practices like accountable care organizations, payment reform and medical homes, we can move away from the current fee-for-service system that rewards volume over value." As the horse-trading that produced the final Senate bill was underway, there was one brief period of tension between Shaheen and some members of the Democratic leadership. Shaheen signed a Dec. 11 letter to Senate President Harry Reid imploring him to reject a proposal to allow people to buy into Medicare at age 55. That notion was floated while negotiations were underway about including a public option in the health reform plan. But Shaheen and 11 other Senate Democrats said expanding the Medicare pool without changing reimbursement rates would exacerbate existing funding inequities in their states. The provision was dropped from the final health reform bill that passed the Senate at the end of 2009. Our ruling Rubens said Shaheen was "the deciding vote to pass Obamacare." It’s true that all 60 Democratic votes -- including Shaheen’s -- were needed to pass the measure through the Senate. However, Shaheen, unlike Ben Nelson, was hardly a holdout until the last minute; she gave indications early on that she supported the president’s reform plan. We rate Rubens’ claim Mostly False.

pomt-05370	"We are coming up on our 40th anniversary of electing a Republican to the United States Senate. 1972 was the last time New Jersey sent a Republican to the United States Senate."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/may/09/chris-christie/chris-christie-said-new-jersey-hasnt-sent-republic/	History bodes poorly for Republican Senate hopefuls in New Jersey. That’s because Richard Nixon was gearing up for a second term in the White House the last time New Jersey voters sent a GOP candidate to the U.S. Senate, according to Gov. Chris Christie. "We are coming up on our 40th anniversary of electing a Republican to the United States Senate. 1972 was the last time New Jersey sent a Republican to the United States Senate," Christie said in a May 4 speech at an event held by the libertarian Cato Institute. New Jersey’s presence in the House of Representatives remains relatively bipartisan. But have four decades passed since the state elected a Republican to the Senate? Outside of an eight-month stint by a Republican appointed in 1982, Democrats have held both Senate seats for more than three decades, PolitiFact New Jersey found. Clifford Case was the last Republican that New Jersey voters elected to the Senate, in 1972. That year he started his fourth term. He lost a bid for re-election in the 1978 GOP primary to Jeffrey Bell. Bill Bradley, a Democrat, defeated Bell in the 1978 general election, starting decades of Democratic dominance of New Jersey’s Senate seats. At least one Republican from New Jersey had served in the Senate in the 40 years leading up to Bradley’s victory, but Democrats have won every Senate election since then. Even in 1982 after Democrat Harrison Williams was forced from office for convictions on bribery and conspiracy charges as part of a federal corruption probe. A Republican briefly held Williams’ seat, but he was appointed, not elected. Then-Gov. Tom Kean in 1982 picked Republican Nicholas Brady to fill in for Williams, whose term ended the next year. Brady stepped down, however, after Frank Lautenberg won in the general election, defeating Republican Millicent Fenwick. Kean appointed Lautenberg to complete the final days of the term. Lautenberg started his first full term in January 1983 and served three six-year terms before leaving Washington, D.C. when he decided not to seek re-election. But he returned to Capitol Hill two years later in 2003 after replacing fellow Democrat Robert Torricelli on the ballot. Torricelli, who had served one term, quit his re-election bid in 2002 a month before voters headed to the polls because of questions about his ethics. Torricelli was reprimanded by the Senate Ethics Committee earlier that year over gifts he accepted from a campaign contributor. Lautenberg is serving his fifth term and is up for re-election in 2014. Robert Menendez, a Democrat, also represents New Jersey in the Senate. In 2006, Menendez replaced Jon Corzine, when the then-first-term Senator Corzine was elected New Jersey’s governor. Menendez won a full term to the Senate later that year. He is up for re-election this November against Republican Joe Kyrillos, who Christie has endorsed. Our ruling Christie said: "We are coming up on our 40th anniversary of electing a Republican to the United States Senate. 1972 was the last time New Jersey sent a Republican to the United States Senate." In 1972, New Jersey sent Republican Clifford Case to the U.S. Senate to serve a fourth term. Since then, New Jersey voters have not elected another GOP candidate to the Senate. And though a Republican from New Jersey briefly served in the Senate in 1982, he was appointed, not elected. We rate Christie’s statement True.

pomt-03574	Says paid family leave is "a program that is standard in all but five nations around the world."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2013/may/18/family-forward-oregon/paid-maternity-leave-really-standard-around-world/	Family Forward Oregon and other advocates of paid leave descended on the state Capitol this month with a Mother’s Day message for legislators: Want to be really mom-friendly? Skip the nosegays and pass legislation mandating paid maternity leave. "Mothers' work opportunities, health, and bonds with their children and partners are affected by the lack of paid family leave -- a program that is standard in all but five nations around the world," read a section of the flier distributed to lawmakers. We’ll be upfront. PolitiFact Oregon found it hard to believe developing nations could offer a work-related benefit that the United States does not. We were eager to truth squad this claim. Lisa Frack, spokeswoman for Family Forward Oregon, shared two sources: An infographic at the Huffington Post website and a New York Times article. Both remarked on our nation’s poor showing on paid leave for moms. We also did some online searching of our own and found that, apparently, it’s well known that the United States is out-of-step with developed nations when it comes to federal law mandating paid maternity leave. Private companies set their own policies, and employers such as Google offer generous leave programs to retain new mothers. States can also set their own rules. California and New Jersey require paid leave for new moms. Washington approved a paid leave requirement, but has yet to find a way to pay for it. But the default is the federal Family and Medical Leave Act, which calls for larger employers and government to allow a qualifying worker to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to have a baby or to care for a sick family member. Oregon law broadens the unpaid leave mandate to more employers and for more purposes, but there remain employees who don’t qualify or who can’t afford to take time off. Now, what about those other countries? The Central Intelligence Agency world fact book indicates there are about 267 "world entities," and of those, 193 are United Nations member states. The World Policy Analysis Center, housed in UCLA’s Fielding School of Public Health, confirmed policies for 188 of those countries. "Only the U.S., Papua New Guinea, Suriname, and 4 small Pacific islands (Nauru, Palau, Samoa, and Tonga) don’t guarantee mothers paid leave from work to care for their infant," wrote Amy Raub, principal research analyst with the World Policy Analysis Center, in an email to PolitiFact Oregon. Earlier news reports say the United States is one in three that lacks paid leave for new mothers. Family Forward has stated in a separate press release that we are one of four nations, not five. We’re not going to focus on the exact number -- except to remind speakers that sometimes, a general figure is better than a specific -- because it’s enough to say we are in the minority. Like, really in the minority. According to the center, even North Korea, which is ruled by a dictator, offers 11 weeks of paid maternity leave. Iraq, which was ruled by a dictator until 2003, offers nine weeks of paid leave. Bangladesh, where garment workers receive a minimum wage of $38 a month, offers 16 weeks of paid leave. Afghanistan requires 13 weeks, Pakistan 12 weeks. Which raises this question: How can working conditions for women -- in this respect -- be considered better in those countries than in the United States? We combed through an exhaustive 2010 report issued by the International Labour Organization, which reviewed maternity legislation for 167 countries. Again, the report confirms our outlier status. But the analysis also shows that not all women in countries where paid maternity leave is the standard are guaranteed full payment for the recommended length of time off, which is 14 weeks. For example, Japan requires 14 weeks of paid leave, but at a portion of regular pay and only if the employee is full-time and covered by health insurance, according to the ILO report. In other words, the ILO analysis shows that 59 percent of countries surveyed provided maternity leave that is "unpaid, paid at less than two-thirds of previous earnings, or paid for a period of less than 14 weeks." The United States is among those countries. We reached out to business representatives who might take issue with the statistic, but they couldn’t shed any light on how these policies really play out in other countries. Frack, the spokeswoman for Family Forward Oregon, said we asked good questions, but didn’t know either. Our ruling: The United States is rare in that the vast majority of countries surveyed have a government policy mandating paid maternity leave. The United States is really rare when compared to countries that are wealthy, developed. And again, we’re not going to quibble over the number of countries, because what we’re talking about is magnitude. We find the statement is accurate, but needs additional information. We’d caution readers to read the fine print. We rule the statement Mostly True. (Want to comment on this fact check?

pomt-00537	Currently, almost 40 percent of people with HIV are not diagnosed until they already have developed AIDS. And that can be up to 10 years after they first are infected with HIV.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/jun/19/fulton-county-health-and-wellness/many-get-hiv-diagnosis-only-after-developing-aids/	The health departments in Fulton and Dekalb counties are hosting a week of free HIV screenings that ends on National HIV Testing Day, June 27. The immediate goal of the Test Atlanta campaign, which starts Sunday, is to encourage people from age 13 to 64 to know their HIV status by getting tested, officials with Fulton County Health and Wellness said in a press release on June 16, 2015. "Finding out whether you are infected with HIV is the first step to getting connected to life-saving care," the release states. " It’s estimated almost 40 percent of people with HIV are not diagnosed until they have developed AIDS. That can be up to 10 years after they first became infected." Those statistics got our attention. PolitiFact Georgia decided to check further. We contacted Lyn Vaughn, risk communicator with Fulton County Health and Wellness, to ask the source of those statistics. She provided with us links to, and excerpts from, two statements, one from the Centers for Disease Control and one she said was from the National Association of People Living with AIDS, the group credited with starting the national testing day. The report from the CDC, issued in 2010, said nationally, the proportion of patients diagnosed with AIDS at or within 12 months of their HIV diagnosis in 2007 was 32 percent. We tried to contact officials with the association to ask about the source of their statistics but were unsuccessful. We later learned from the group’s web site that the association filed bankruptcy and closed its doors after 30 years in February 2013. The CDC, which supported National HIV Testing Day (NHTD) from its founding, continues to promote the annual event and advocate for routine HIV testing. According to the CDC, more than 1.2 million Americans are living with HIV, and almost one in seven or 14 percent are unaware of their infection. In the past decade, the number of people living with HIV has increased, but the annual number of new HIV infections has remained relatively stable -- at about 50,000 a year, the CDC reports. So what about that statistic? Vaughn later sent us additional information, including a recent news report on ongoing HIV testing available to patients who come through the emergency room at Atlanta’s Grady Memorial Hospital. Not all of the patients agree to be tested. But among those who were diagnosed as HIV infected between July 2013 and February of this year, nearly half had AIDS, according to data we received from Grady. The physician in charge of Grady’s program said many of the patients in the group that was subject of the report had been HIV positive for several years. The other data we looked at came from the state Department of Public Health. In Georgia, 24 percent of all newly diagnosed HIV patients in 2012 already had AIDS, the agency reported. That percentage also held true for 2013 as well, DPH reports show. We also circled back to the CDC, where the most recent data available is for 2012. Nationally, also, 24 percent of patients who were initially diagnosed with HIV infection were simultaneously diagnosed with AIDS, the CDC reported in 2012. Most of those people were likely infected for many years without knowing it, the CDC said. Our ruling The press release from Fulton County Health and Wellness promoting the week of testing for HIV states that almost 40 percent of people with the virus are not diagnosed until they already have developed AIDS. And that can be up to 10 years after they first are infected. That specific statistic reportedly came from a national organization that is no longer in operation and appears high compared to the 24 percent figure reported t by the state and CDC. But that still supports the health department’s overarching point about the need for early testing and treatment. For that reason, we rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-13319	Maggie Hassan "raised tuition, making it the highest in America."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/oct/06/national-republican-senatorial-committee/did-magggie-hassan-raise-tuition-making-new-hampsh/	Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan has made college affordability a central part of her campaign for U.S. Senate, and she often notes that New Hampshire’s university system froze tuition for the first time in 25 years under her administration in stump speeches. But Republicans are now trying to use Hassan’s higher education record against her as she tries to unseat U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a Republican, in the November election. A few days ago, we fact-checked a claim, made in a National Republican Senatorial Committee television ad, that Hassan had skipped out on most University System of New Hampshire meetings. We found that claim to be Mostly True. That ad also included the claim that Hassan had "raised tuition, making it the highest in America." Our readers asked us: is that true? PolitiFact decided to take a look. We reached out to the NRSC, which pointed to an executive order issued by Gov. Hassan in November of 2014. That order rescinded $3 million in state funding for the USNH, which oversees the University of New Hampshire, Keene State College, Plymouth State College, and Granite State College. The take-back came in the midst of a budget crunch and was applied during the fiscal year ending in 2015, or the 2014-15 school year. That one-time $3 million take-back didn’t result in an immediate tuition increase. University leaders looked to the following state budget for enough funding to continue an ongoing tuition freeze. Among the things The NRSC pointed to were comments made by UNH president Mark Huddleston in an Associated Press article saying that tuition was a "straight-line function of how New Hampshire invests." So let’s look at how New Hampshire funds higher education through the state budget. During the 2009-10 and 2010-11 school years, the university system received $100 million annually from the state. But a Legislature led by then-House Speaker Bill O’Brien, a Republican, slashed funding basically in half, allocating $51 million and $54 million for the 2011-12 and 2012-13 school years. After the cuts, the university system announced a nearly 10 percent increase in tuition. Hassan then took office in 2013 and oversaw a partial restoration in funding, with the university system receiving $69 million and $84 million in the state budget for the following two school years. In return, USNH trustees agreed to a two-year tuition freeze covering the 2013-14 and 2014-15 academic years. In September 2014, USNH leaders promised to continue that freeze for another two years if the Legislature and governor approved a budget that included $100 million in state aid to the system in fiscal year 2016 and $105 million in fiscal year 2017, restoring it to pre-O’Brien levels. After the $3 million take-back was announced in November 2014, the USNH did not change its budget request -- suggesting it didn’t play a very important role. So what happened during the budget process? Hassan proposed USNH receive $87 million in 2016 and $94 million in 2017. USNH responded with a statement saying the proposed budget was "insufficient to continue the tuition freeze." University system leaders later scaled back their request, asking for $90 million in 2016 and $95 million in 2017. A Republican-controlled House ultimately approved a budget that provided $19 million less than Hassan had requested -- $81 million in both 2016 and 2017. That’s when the university system announced it would be raising tuition. In other words, during Hassan’s first budget, funding was restored enough for the university system to freeze tuition for two years. In the following budget years, state aid fell short of what USNH leaders said they needed to continue a freeze. It is also important to note that while state aid plays an important role in setting tuition, it is not the Legislature nor the Governor who set tuition rates for the USNH. It is the Board of Trustees. As governor, Hassan sits on that board, and, like governors before her, has missed most of the trustees’ meetings. Perhaps symbolically, the one meeting on June 28, 2013 that she participated in, she made the motion to freeze tuition at the university system. But had she attended other meetings and voted against raising tuition on June 26, 2015, when the board approved the hikes, she still wouldn’t have been able to swing the vote the other way. And while USNH leaders like to say that state aid in practice determines tuition rates, there’s probably some wiggle room. "The loss of state appropriations does not fully explain the increases to the cost of public higher education in New Hampshire. Between 2003 and 2011, average tuition rates within the University System rose nearly 40 percent – even with tuition rates adjusted for inflation ... During the same time period, state appropriations per full-time equivalent student decreased by less than 12 percent," according to A New Hampshire Center for Public Policy Studies report from 2014 analyzed public higher education spending in New Hampshire. Highest in the nation? The NRSC also pointed to a College Board report that said New Hampshire had the highest in-state tuition for four-year institutions in the country in the 2015-2016 year. That’s correct, but New Hampshire’s public college affordability crisis predates Hassan’s tenure as governor. When she took office in January 2013, the Granite State already had the highest in-state tuition in the country for four-year schools, according to the College Board. The television ad also doesn’t specify that it is referring to four-year colleges. Under Hassan, two-year community colleges have frozen tuition for several years running. Community colleges in New Hampshire are also not the most expensive in the country. During the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 school years, that distinction belonged to Vermont, according to the College Board. All of these things are correct: Hassan did make a one-time $3 million rescission from the university system for the 2014-15 year, New Hampshire did have the highest tuition rate in the country for public four-year schools in 2015-2016, and tuition did rise under Hassan’s tenure. But these things do not add up to Hassan raising tuition. While the governor played an important role in setting the budget that heavily influenced tuition rates, she was one among many players, and the University System is the one that sets tuition rates, not the governor. Our ruling The National Senatorial Committee says Maggie Hassan "raised tuition, making it the highest in America." For starters, in-state tuition in New Hampshire for four-year colleges has been the highest in America for years, but it was that way before Hassan took office. As for Hassan’s role as governor, of the two budgets she crafted, one gave the university system enough money to freeze tuition, according to USNH leaders, and the other one didn’t. Additionally, the state budget does not dictate tuition rates, the board of trustees does. In addition, the Republican-controlled Legislature pared down what Hassan offered in her budget proposal. The statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-10693	"Senator Obama's relatives and friends say he has been talking about running for president for at least the last 15 years," a campaign spokesman said.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/06/hillary-clinton/ridiculous-evidence-but-true/	The campaign of Sen. Hillary Clinton recently trotted out quotes from Sen. Barack Obama's kindergarten teacher to prove that he's been aiming for the White House longer than he admits. Seriously. The conflict between the top Democrats running for president began when Obama said this: "I have not been planning to run for president for however number of years some of the other candidates have been planning for." The Clinton campaign responded with a thoroughly researched news release that culled details from Obama's life that had been reported in feature articles about him. "Senator Obama's relatives and friends say he has been talking about running for president for at least the last 15 years," the Clinton news release said. "So who's not telling the truth, them or him?" The evidence: • Former classmates who said that when he was at Harvard Law School, Obama was "thinking about politics." • A brother-in-law saying Obama told him in the early 1990s that he was interested in a run for president. • An essay Obama wrote in third grade called, "I want to be a president." • An essay he wrote in kindergarten called, "I Want To Become President." PolitiFact set out to confirm those sources. Brad Berenson, a classmate and friend of Obama's at Harvard Law School in the early 1990s, said: "I certainly never heard him say directly or indirectly that he wanted to be president of the United States. That kind of sentiment would have been absurdly presumptuous at that point." Now, Obama spent some of his early years in Indonesia, including kindergarten and third grade. We started to track down those teachers living on the other side of the world, but then we realized this goose chase wasn't worth the effort. The Obama campaign is not denying the accuracy of the Clinton reports. Anita Dunn, a Democratic strategist, says there's no doubt the Clinton campaign has some facts on its side. "The overall thematic attack that he is out there saying that he is somehow different from someone else in the field, that he is somehow propelled into this race … I think that's absolutely fair game for the Clinton camp to go after," said Dunn, a Democratic strategist not aligned with a candidate, but who worked as a consultant to Obama's Hopefund PAC for six months in 2006. "On the other hand, were they wise in the example they used?" It does appear that Obama expressed ambition for the office of president many years ago. We wish we had a ruling category called "True, but ridiculous." We don't, so we're left with True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2007-12-06T00:00:00	2007-12-02	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-04992	The transportation sales tax would cost the average consumer an estimated $112 a year.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/jul/20/john-watson/will-t-splost-add-112-year-consumers/	The poor penny. Some politicians want to get rid of it. It often gets lost in the living room sofa or underneath the car seat. Pennies, though, can add up. Supporters of the July 31 transportation referendum say a penny-per-dollar sales tax would pay for scores of mass transit and road projects that would ease congestion in the Atlanta region. One referendum proponent recently said the extra penny added on to items that may cost a buck is well worth it in exchange for the transportation improvements it would fund. In fact, he said the annual cost would be less than how much it costs the average Atlanta-area resident to be stuck in traffic a year -- $924. PolitiFact Georgia previously rated the $924 claim Mostly True. PolitiFact Georgia saw the following statement and wondered how close to the truth was this claim. "An additional penny will cost the average consumer an estimated $112 annually. In exchange, they’ll get traffic relief, more income-producing time at work and more leisure time at home," John Watson wrote in The Marietta Daily Journal. Watson is a senior adviser to Citizens for Transportation Mobility, an organization leading the push to get the hotly debated referendum passed. He served as a chief of staff to Sonny Perdue when he was governor.. The Atlanta Regional Commission, which has provided technical and research assistance to local and state officials involved in the referendum, compiled a report on the sales tax impact of the referendum. One chart contained an estimated final resident cost for each year of the referendum. The average per resident, ARC calculated, was $112 a year. Referendum supporters estimate the tax would, when taking inflation into account, raise as much as $8.5 billion over the 10 years it would be in effect. That estimate came from state tax revenue forecasts. The 10 metro Atlanta counties that would collect the tax are Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, Gwinnett, Henry and Rockdale. ARC’s first step in coming up with the estimate was to determine what percentage of the funds would come from metro Atlanta residents as opposed to tourists and businesses. Its estimate is 65 percent of the revenue would come from residents. ARC officials then estimated the population in the 10-county area that will vote on the referendum and projected the region’s growth over the 10-year period. ARC believes the region’s population will be about 4.3 million residents in 2013. In 2022, the ARC projection is 4.86 million. ARC estimates an average population growth of nearly 56,000 people a year. Population in the 10-county region rose by an average of 69,000 a year between 2000 and 2010, U.S. Census figures show. "It’s a pretty conservative population forecast," ARC planner Jim Skinner said. Divide the estimated sales tax revenue by the number of residents and the math equals ARC’s estimate of $112 a year per person, as Watson said in the op-ed. PolitiFact Georgia, however, had a question about the numbers. The population estimate is for all residents, including those under age 18. The percentage of residents under age 18 in the region ranges from a low of nearly 24 percent in Fulton County to a high of 29 percent in Clayton County. We know many children like to play with pennies, but they spend less than their parents. Should they be included in the estimate? Skinner said ARC was not asked to do a breakdown by age. He also said some agencies conduct research on taxes and use the entire state population. Bert Brantley, who is assisting Citizens for Transportation Mobility with media relations and public outreach in support of the referendum, said the larger point is still the amount of money people could pay in sales taxes for transportation is much less than the estimated annual cost to be stuck in traffic. "Now obviously, not every resident in the region is a commuter, but we all already pay a congestion tax in wasted time and fuel, so this is not a tax vs. no tax argument," said Brantley, a former communications director for Perdue. PolitiFact Georgia calculated how much each resident would pay a year in additional sales tax, excluding people under age 18. Our estimate: $132.37 a year. The total comes close to ARC’s estimate. With this bit of context that ARC’s estimate includes all residents in the 10-county area, we rate Watson’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-03309	Under Obamacare, "75 percent of small businesses now say they are going to be forced to either fire workers or cut their hours."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/29/marco-rubio/sen-marco-rubio-says-75-small-businesses-say-theyl/	Sen. Marco Rubio says it’s not too late to stop Obamacare. In fact, he says, Congress should refuse to pass a spending bill that funds it, even at the risk of shutting down government. That’s because he sees "mounting evidence of how Obamacare creates more problems than it solves, particularly for small business owners and the people who work for them." One of those pieces of evidence: the number of small business who "say they are going to be forced to either fire workers or cut their hours." According to his FoxNews.com op-ed on July 25, 2013, that number is a jaw-dropping 75 percent. (He repeated the claim in a July 29 piece for RedState.com, "Shut Down Obamacare, Not Government.") Rubio blames the health care law’s now-delayed employer mandate, which requires businesses with the equivalent of 50 or more full-time employees to offer affordable, comprehensive health coverage or potentially face penalties of $2,000 or more per full-time worker after the first 30. That creates a disastrous disincentive, he argues: "If you are a small business with about 47, 48 or 49 employees and you want to hire more people, Obamacare encourages you to hold back on hiring new workers or cut the hours of existing ones so that you don’t reach 50 employees. That is why 75 percent of small businesses now say they are going to be forced to either fire workers or cut their hours." Do three in four American small businesses say the health care law will drive them to fire workers or cut their hours? Survey says Rubio’s not alone in his distaste for the employer mandate, which has detractors on the right and left. Even some supporters of the health care law don’t like the way the mandate’s structured, noting that it may discourage hiring and create an incentive to keep workers under 30 hours. But do 75 percent of small businesses say they face that pressure? Rubio’s office provided us with a July 16, 2013, Washington Examiner article headlined "74% of small businesses will fire workers, cut hours under Obamacare," which begins: "Despite the administration's controversial decision to delay forcing companies to join Obamacare for a year, three-quarters of small businesses are still making plans to duck the costly law by firing workers, reducing hours of full-time staff, or shift many to part-time, according to a sobering survey released by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce." It goes on to summarize results from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s quarterly Small Business Outlook Study. We read the the study and reached out to the chamber. And there’s a problem with that "three-quarters of small businesses" claim. Well, a series of problems, actually. Categories don’t add up The study was conducted among a national sample of 1,300 executives for small businesses, defined as fewer than 500 employees and with annual revenue less than $25 million. It included chamber members and non-members "weighted to be representative of the small business population." But it turns out the question the Washington Examiner and Rubio cited wasn’t asked of the entire group — something not clear in the published results. The chamber told us executives were first asked whether the employer mandate would affect them: As a result of the health care law, the employer mandate will require employers with more than 50 full-time workers to offer health coverage to all full-time employees and their dependents or face a penalty. The law defines a full-time employee as someone who works 30 hours per week and the penalty is based on the number of full-time employees. Will you be impacted by the employer mandate? Just 17 percent of the small business executives said yes. So less than one in five businesses that participated in the survey said that the employer mandate would even affect them. Those 17 percent were then asked how they planned to respond. They could select as many answers as they felt applied to them: Please indicate how your business will react to this new mandate. Please select all that apply. a. Reduce hiring to avoid surpassing the 50 full-time equivalent employees (24 percent) b. Cut back hours to reduce the number of full-time employees (27 percent) c. Stop providing employee health insurance d. Replace full-time employees with part-time workers (23 percent) e. None of the above The chamber published responses for answers A, B and D — the responses cited by the Washington Examiner and Rubio. It has not provided responses for answers C and E. So, the only way to reach 75 percent is to not only ignore the majority of executives who didn’t answer the question, but also to fold those who said they would "reduce hiring" with those who planned to cut hours or replace workers. And we just don’t know how many employers said, "None of the above." It’s also not clear from published results exactly what percentage of affected businesses said they would cut hours or replace workers. It could be as high as 50 percent, assuming there was no overlap between the executives who said they planned to replace full-timers with part-timers and those who said they would cut back hours. It could be as low as 27 percent, assuming total overlap — that the same people who said they would replace full-timers with part-timers also said they intended to cut back hours. So, of all small businesses in the study, how many said they would cut back hours or replace full-time workers in response to the health care law? Just 5 percent to 9 percent. And that’s in line with other evidence. Most companies have 10 employees or less — far from the 50-employee threshold. Meanwhile, of firms with 25 to 49 people — a group Rubio said he was concerned about — 87 percent already offer health benefits, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation’s annual employer survey. Of those with 50 to 199 employees — the smallest businesses actually subject to penalties in 2015 for not offering insurance — 94 percent already offer benefits. Meanwhile, under the law, businesses with fewer than 25 employees may already qualify for tax credits for offering coverage — an extra boost they didn’t get before. Still, surveys show small businesses are worried. A May Gallup poll commissioned by an employment law firm showed that 41 percent have held off on plans to hire new employees, 19 percent have reduced workers, and 18 percent have reduced employees’ hours to part time. Part of the problem, said Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow in the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute, is that small employers don’t actually know yet how the law will affect them. Only 30 percent of respondents in the U.S. Chamber’s small business survey said they were prepared — including understanding what’s required to participate in health care insurance exchanges. "There's a lot of misinformation and a lot of ideology out there," Blumberg said. Our ruling Rubio, arguing to defund Obamacare, said "75 percent of small businesses now say they are going to be forced to either fire workers or cut their hours." That’s not remotely true. In the study of small businesses he cited, less than 10 percent said they might make that choice. His office cited a news article that misinterpreted ambiguous results from an interest-group survey. But basic statistics about America’s small businesses show the number was seriously unlikely, and a quick message to the U.S. Chamber exposed the error. Yet opinion pieces under Rubio’s name repeat the claim — one that’s so wrong, it’s ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2013-07-29T13:55:41	2013-07-25	['None']
pomt-04576	"The truth is, Planned Parenthood does not provide mammograms. Planned Parenthood refers women to mammography providers, serving as the middlewoman, if you will."	true	/georgia/statements/2012/sep/25/karen-handel/karen-handel-seeks-set-record-straight-komen-plann/	Former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel came out firing on all cylinders in her book, "Planned Bullyhood." Handel, who most recently served as the former vice president of public policy at Susan G. Komen for the Cure, included criticisms of Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal, state politics and decisions at Komen. Included in the book is a detailed account of this year’s much-publicized controversy at the breast cancer nonprofit organization. In early February, Komen announced it would no longer make grants to organizations that were under local, state or federal investigation. Planned Parenthood, which received more than $600,000 annually from Komen to perform breast examinations and conduct breast health education at 19 of its centers, was facing an investigation by Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., into whether the organization had violated a prohibition against using federal funds for abortion services. After a firestorm of criticism, Komen reversed its decision, and Handel resigned less than a week later. Some critics suggested Handel was behind Komen’s policy decision. But in her book, Handel says Komen had considered ending the relationship with Planned Parenthood "for at least a decade," as Komen restructured its grant model to focus on measurable outcomes to fighting breast cancer. That focus, she said, excluded much of what Planned Parenthood did. In her book, Handel makes pointed statements regarding Planned Parenthood’s services, noting that the organization promoted itself as a provider of mammograms to poor women. "The truth is, Planned Parenthood does not provide mammograms," she wrote. "Planned Parenthood refers women to mammography providers, serving as the middlewoman, if you will." We wondered whether this was true of the organization known for being a key player in women’s health issues. Does Planned Parenthood really not provide mammograms? And, if not, how does the organization handle the services? And does it receive or provide funding for the work? The argument over mammography and other services at Planned Parenthood has been ongoing for several years. Much of the debate centers on a congressional push last year to cut funding to Planned Parenthood, which has been cited as the country’s leading abortion provider. The federal government pays Planned Parenthood about $75 million a year to offer cancer screenings, breast exams and other care to lower-income women. That money cannot be spent on abortion services. The funding cut, which passed the House, was shot down in the Senate. Organization President Cecile Richards denounced the cuts in February 2011 on HLN’s "The Joy Behar Show." During that interview, Richards said that if the bill to cut funding ever became law, millions of women in the country would lose access to health care, not to abortion services but to basic family planning services, such as mammograms and cancer screenings. Richards was immediately challenged on her statement by the California-based anti-abortion group Live Action, which secretly recorded phone conversations between an actress and employees at various Planned Parenthood clinics. The actress, supposedly seeking a mammogram, was told the service was not available and in some cases was referred elsewhere. Richards said her comments on Behar’s show were taken out of context. So are mammograms on Planned Parenthood’s service menu? We asked, and in an email response, a spokeswoman for the organization said doctors and nurses at Planned Parenthood health centers provide clinical breast exams and refer patients to facilities with technicians for mammograms based on breast exams, age or family history. Planned Parenthood also refers women to breast specialists when a potential abnormality is found and follow-up tests are needed. And with the organization’s expanded breast health initiative, Planned Parenthood will be able to cover the cost of this specialized care for more women, the email said. Handel’s statement that Planned Parenthood doesn’t provide mammograms and only refers clients for those services at other facilities is supported by the organization itself. We rate the claim True.

John McCain and President George W. Bush on Iraq, taxes and energy, an ad from the Campaign to Defend America finally turns to health care. "Absolutely no plan for universal health care. McSame as Bush." Universal health care has been much debated in the Democratic primary campaign, but hardly mentioned on the Republican side. The consensus among health care experts is that to achieve universal health care — the intention to cover every person with no exceptions — there must be a legal requirement for care, such as a mandate for individuals to buy insurance . In the Democratic primary campaign, Sen. Hillary Clinton supports an individual mandate, while Sen. Barack Obama opposes it on the grounds that its implementation could penalize the working poor. Bush does not support any sort of health care mandate, nor does McCain. "On health care we trust patients to make decisions, not bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.," Bush said on March 13, 2008, at a Republican Congresional Committee dinner. At a health care forum on Oct. 31, 2007, hosted by the Kaiser Family Foundation, McCain said he opposed mandates, even while discussing plans to improve access to health care. "I don't think that there should be a mandate for every American to have health insurance. I think that one of our goals should be that every American own their own home. But I'm not going to mandate that every American own their own home," McCain said. McCain does have a health care plan, but there's no clause for making it apply to everyone and therefore universal. So we find this claim to be True.	None	Campaign to Defend America	None	None	None	2008-03-17T00:00:00	2008-03-05	['John_McCain', 'George_W._Bush']

pomt-12024	Says PolitiFact reported that "95 percent of what (Donald Trump) says is a lie."	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/sep/18/joy-behar/joy-behar-politifact-said-trump-lies-95-percent-ti/	The View co-host Joy Behar gave a selective — and frankly, incorrect — reading of PolitiFact’s rulings on President Donald Trump’s statements during an on-air debate with White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Behar brought up Trump’s Truth-O-Meter record during the Sept. 6, 2017, episode of the ABC talk show, asking Sanders how she thought the press should report on his statements. A reader emailed us asking if Behar was accurately describing our rulings, so we took a closer look at the exchange. "Is the media supposed to not report on the fact that 95 percent of what he says is a lie?" Behar asked. "The problem with that, Joy, is that is, you are doing exactly what we are talking about and pushing a false narrative," Sanders replied. "Ninety-five percent of what the president says is not a lie." "No, it’s not," Behar said. "It’s from PolitiFact." It appeared that Behar was referring to Trump’s PolitiFact file, which tracks every statement we’ve rated on the Truth-O-Meter. We compile the results of a person's most interesting or provocative statements in their file to provide a broad overview of the kinds of statements they tend to make. A spokeswoman for The View didn’t clarify Behar’s claim by our deadline. As of Sept. 6, 21 of the 446 statements we examined earned a True rating. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com That is only 5 percent. Does that mean he lied 95 percent of the time? In a word, no. While we appreciate being a part of a discussion about the facts, Behar wasn’t using our file on Trump properly. Let’s take some time to re-examine what the Truth-O-Meter does and doesn’t do. Meter reader There’s no question Trump has a shaky relationship with the truth. His campaign misstatements earned our 2015 Lie of the Year award, and his Truth-O-Meter record was much worse than Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton during the presidential campaign. His tendency to play loose with facts has continued into his presidency. We’ve given him Pants On Fire ratings for gross distortions saying Charlottesville, Va., counter-protesters didn’t have a permit; that CNN’s ratings have suffered mightily; and that allegations his campaign colluded with Russia "is a made-up story." He’s also received False ratings for saying President Barack Obama’s immigration policies led to an upswing in MS 13 gang activity; that his own administration did more in the first 90 days than any other presidency; and that he’s saved "millions of jobs" since becoming president. Overall, he’s earned 147 False ratings (33 percent of all the Trump rulings we’ve made) and 69 Pants on Fire ratings (15 percent). Those statements are provably wrong. But to call the rest lies, as Behar did, doesn’t reflect the Truth-O-Meter’s design. We define our ratings in our description of our fact-checking process, which helps us determine the veracity of a statement we’ve chosen to check: TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim. So when we rate a statement something less than True but more than False, the speaker can be accurate to some degree, but incorrect because it’s omitting an important angle, being used in the wrong context or drawing a bad conclusion. For example: When Trump tweeted in February, "The National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion," he was using a real statistic from the U.S. Treasury Department. He was clearly attempting to make it appear he was responsible for the decrease. But experts we interviewed said not only did the national debt fluctuate on a regular basis as it continued an inexorable upward climb, there was no way Trump enacted policies leading to the minor (and temporary) drop. We rated Trump’s tweet Mostly False. Trump has received 52 Mostly True ratings, 64 Half True ratings, and 93 Mostly False ratings. Also keep in mind that a person’s PolitiFact file isn’t a comprehensive look at every single statement they make, nor is it a random sample of what they say. It would be logistically impossible for PolitiFact to make informed rulings on every single comment an official makes. We choose to fact-check statements that are interesting to us or to readers, or that are relevant to policy discussions or the news of the day. The content of the statements can sometimes repeat, as well, landing another rating in the file. We’ve rated Trump’s assertion that America is the highest-taxed nation in the world four times over two years, each earning a False rating. This is not to beat a dead horse, but rather to address Trump’s repetition of the falsehood during the campaign. Our ruling Behar said PolitiFact reported that "95 percent of what (Trump) says is a lie." That’s a misreading of Trump’s file, which notes that of the 446 statements we’ve examined, only 5 percent earned a True rating. We’ve rated Trump’s statements False or Pants On Fire a total of 48 percent of the time. The definitions of our Truth-O-Meter ratings make it difficult to call the bulk of Trump’s statements outright lies. The files we keep for people's statements act as a scorecard of the veracity of their most interesting claims. Keep in mind that the statements we rate are neither a random nor comprehensive look at things Trump has said. Behar oversimplified when invoking our Truth-O-Meter rulings. We rate her statement False. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Joy Behar	None	None	None	2017-09-18T17:00:00	2017-09-06	['None']
pomt-08546	As Milwaukee County executive, Scott Walker "eliminated the waiting list for long-term care for older adults through the Family Care program."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/01/scott-walker/republican-governor-candidate-scott-walker-says-he/	As Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker seeks a promotion to governor, Democrats have waged a steady attack, accusing him of gutting important services in a single-minded push to cut taxes. So, it’s no surprise to hear Walker, a Republican, highlight a popular program that has grown steadily on his watch. Case in point: Family Care -- the long-term care program for seniors. Walker did it in a fever-pitch victory speech on primary election night: "Before I took office, there was literally a waiting list of 3,000 older adults waiting for long-term care in our community. Today not one senior in our community is on a waiting list because we stood up and led the way. We can do it for the state as well." On the biography section of his campaign website, he more directly takes credit: "As County Executive (Scott) ... eliminated the waiting list for long-term care for older adults through the Family Care program." So, has the waiting list disappeared? And is Walker correct in claiming credit for it? When we asked the Walker campaign for backup on the claim, Walker returned the call himself -- and took personal responsibility for what he said was an error in his primary night statement. The waiting list, he said, actually had been 2,500 -- not 3,000. Good to know, but our main interest was whether it disappeared. Let’s dig into the claim. Family Care was designed to provide better care for seniors and end the waiting list for services. The program now provides 6,400 older adults in the county with residential options, transportation, meals and other services. Indeed, there was no need for Walker to fall on his sword -- the state department that tracks Family Care enrollment says the list did reach 3,000 at one point. The list started shrinking in mid-2000, when Milwaukee County and four other counties started pilot projects under the Family Care program, according to multiple sources we interviewed. The program is administered by the county, but the state funds most of its budget. A host of public documents and sources in and out of state and local government show the waiting list for the Family Care program was eliminated as of the end of June 2002. And Walker was executive at the time, though he was sworn in less than 2 months earlier. So that part of Walker’s statement is correct: There was a big waiting list before he took office, and today no one waits. That leaves the larger question of who deserves credit, the main point in Walker’s touting of the success of the program. For that, a timetable is important. We based this chronology on county and state audits, budget documents, newspaper stories and the recollection of key players: 1995: Health officials in the administration of then-Gov. Tommy Thompson launch redesign of long-term care in Wisconsin, including nursing home, community- and home-based care. 1998: Thompson announces the selection of Milwaukee as a Family Care county, after years of lobbying led by Stephanie Sue Stein, the county’s Department on Aging chief. 1999: State lawmakers and Thompson approve Family Care funding in the state budget bill. At the time, Walker was serving in the state Assembly from Wauwatosa and supported the budget as a member of the Republican majority. 2000: Pilot program in Milwaukee County starts up. 2001: In November, the Milwaukee County Board and then-County Executive F. Thomas Ament approve a county budget that fully phases in Family Care during 2002. It keeps the county on course to extinguish the waiting list by June 2002. 2002, May 9: Walker is sworn in as Ament’s successor after winning an April special election prompted by Ament’s forced retirement amid the county pension scandal. 2002, July 1: Family Care is fully up and running, and the waiting list is a thing of the past. The timeline makes clear the waiting list was on a track to be eliminated well before Walker took office -- and nearly gone by the time he won the job. Walker’s primary-night phrase -- "We stood up and led the way" -- appears to point voters to the early days of the fight to get the Family Care pilot program approved for the county. At the time, Walker was not yet county executive and does not appear to have played a role in the Legislature beyond joining a bipartisan group to support of the pilot programs. Walker argues that his actions since taking county office have kept a waiting list from redeveloping. He points out -- correctly -- that he and other county officials battled the state over adequate funding, especially after deficits threatened the program. The program gets almost all of its funding from Madison, so keeping it going is far easier than other county programs that rely heavily on local property taxes. And in 2004, Walker and the County Board put $12.2 million in county funds into Family Care to bring it back from insolvency. During his tenure, the program has grown from serving some 2,900 seniors in the spring of 2002 to serving more than 6,400 seniors in Milwaukee County today. Walker gets praise from a key advocate for seniors, Tom Frazier, the former head of the Coalition of Wisconsin Aging Groups. "Scott Walker has been extremely supportive," Frazier said. Let’s take stock. Walker’s claim on the end of the waiting list is accurate -- and he did play a role both in starting the program (minor) and keeping it going (more substantive). But the central part of the claim is that as county executive he eliminated the waiting list. That list ended less than two months after he took office and mainly through the efforts of county officials who preceded him. Walker has supported the program as county executive, but nearly all of the heavy lifting on the waiting list was done before he arrived on the scene. And preventing a waiting list from reappearing is different than taking credit for ending it. We rate Walker’s statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04711	Says Chris Christie was the "first governor in America to endorse" Mitt Romney.	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/sep/03/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-he-was-first-governor-endors/	Before Gov. Chris Christie made his case in primetime last week for why Mitt Romney should be elected president, the governor pointed to his original endorsement in October as evidence that he truly believes in the Republican nominee. Leading up to his keynote address Tuesday at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla., Christie dismissed a New York Post article claiming he doubted Romney could defeat President Barack Obama. As part of his rebuttal, Christie repeated a line he's said before: he was the first governor to endorse Romney. "I’ve spent since October of last year -- first governor in America to endorse him -- (running) around the country to 15 different states campaigning for him and raising money," Christie said in an interview Tuesday on "CBS This Morning." "I didn’t do that ‘cause I had nothing else to do," Christie continued. "I did it because I believe the guy’s the best guy to be president and that he can win." But PolitiFact New Jersey found that Christie’s claim is off. He was one of the first Republican governors to back Romney, but not the first. The governor's office did not respond last week to an email presenting our findings. Here are the facts: A week after announcing he wouldn’t make a presidential run himself, Christie traveled to New Hampshire and endorsed Romney on Oct. 11, 2011. "I’m here in New Hampshire today for one simple reason: America cannot survive another four years of Barack Obama, and Mitt Romney is the man we need to lead America and we need him now," Christie said during a news conference. But about four months earlier, the Romney campaign announced he had the support of two other Republican governors: Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman and Idaho Gov. Butch Otter. The campaign announced Heineman's endorsement in a June 10, 2011 news release posted on its website. "Mitt Romney has a proven record of balancing budgets, keeping taxes low, and creating an environment for job growth," Heineman said in the news release. "As a governor, I understand the challenges this country faces and Mitt Romney has the experience to meet those challenges." In a June 20, 2011 news release on its website, the campaign said Otter would serve as co-chairman of Romney's Idaho Statewide Steering Committee. "Mitt Romney has the experience needed to grow the economy and create jobs," Otter said in the release. In the months ahead, news articles noted both governors’ endorsements. "Romney has been endorsed by two governors, Dave Heineman of Nebraska and Butch Otter of Idaho, as well as one former governor, Colorado’s Bill Owens," according to a July 2, 2011 article on the Washington Post’s website. A Politico article on July 16, 2011 pointed out how only a few governors -- including Heineman and Otter -- had handed out endorsements in the GOP presidential primary race: "Only a small handful of Republican governors have endorsed in the presidential race, with Govs. Dave Heineman of Nebraska and Butch Otter of Idaho backing Mitt Romney, and Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal endorsing Newt Gingrich." In a Dec. 1 article in the New York Times, Heineman was identified as "the first governor to endorse Mr. Romney." Our ruling In light of a New York Post article claiming Christie doubted whether Romney could beat Obama, Christie claimed in a TV interview that he was the "first governor in America to endorse" Romney. But about four months before Christie offered his endorsement, the Romney campaign announced he had the support of Republican governors in Nebraska and Idaho, and news articles noted both endorsements afterward. We rate the statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com. Editor's Note: After this story was published, we added a line noting how the governor's office had not responded to an email presenting our findings. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9bc52084-48a1-4732-a941-7b31c4baa16b	None	Chris Christie	None	None	None	2012-09-03T07:30:00	2012-08-28	['United_States', 'Chris_Christie', 'Mitt_Romney']
pomt-05642	"New Jersey loses net, that is minus those who come into the state, 30,000 students a year."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/mar/22/susan-cole/state-college-president-claims-new-jersey-experien/	The president of Montclair State University said one fact illuminates the problems with the state’s higher education system: many New Jersey students attend college elsewhere. Susan Cole recently appeared on NJTV where she argued that the state has failed to invest in the higher education infrastructure, including buildings and faculty, needed to make New Jersey competitive and economically prosperous. Asked in the March 13 interview how far the state is from where it needs to be in this area, Cole said: "The gap is huge and it is most evident if you look at the net out-migration of students from New Jersey. New Jersey loses net, that is minus those who come into the state, 30,000 students a year. That's every year, year after year, 30,000 of our best prepared, most educated students leave the state for other states." Are tens of thousands of college students leaving the Garden State? Yes. A report released last year by the New Jersey Higher Education Task Force, a committee appointed by Gov. Chris Christie, said: "In part because of a lack of college capacity, New Jersey has a too-long history of losing more college-bound students than attend in-state." The National Center for Education Statistics, a research arm of the U.S. Department of Education, keeps tabs on where students choose to pursue education after high school. In fall 2008, the most recent data available, 36,135 New Jersey residents enrolled for the first time in an out-of-state institution granting at least an associate’s degree. At the same time 5,268 first-time freshmen came to New Jersey, for a net loss of 30,867 students. Diane Reed, a spokeswoman for Montclair State University, confirmed that’s the data Cole was referencing in the television interview. In comparison, New Jersey lost a net total of 29,559 of first-time freshmen in fall 2006. A decade before that the state lost 20,005 students. The National Center for Education Statistics also narrows the data to focus on freshmen who graduated high school in the last year and freshmen attending a four-year institution who graduated high school in the last year. Both groups experienced a net loss of students close to the figure Cole cited. New Jersey lost a net total of 27,819 freshmen who graduated high school in the last year and 27,343 freshmen attending four-year institutions who graduated high school in the last year, according to the most recent data. By all three measures, more students left New Jersey then came to the state in the fall of 2008 for a postsecondary education than any other state in the nation. Our ruling The president of Montclair State University said: "New Jersey loses net, that is minus those who come into the state, 30,000 students a year." According to the most recent federal education statistics, 36,135 first-time freshmen students left New Jersey and 5,268 came to the state. That’s a net loss of 30,867. And when narrowing the data to freshmen who graduated in the past 12 months or students attending four-year institutions, the net loss is still more than 27,000 students. Cole’s on the mark with this statement. We rate it True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Susan Cole	None	None	None	2012-03-22T07:30:00	2012-03-13	['New_Jersey']
pomt-03410	"Seventy-four percent of Rhode Islanders support [a] national popular vote [for president] because they, as I, believe in one person-one vote."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/jun/30/raymond-gallison/ri-rep-raymond-gallison-says-74-percent-rhode-isla/	Should we change the way we pick our president? That was the issue June 13, 2013, when the Rhode Island House of Representatives debated a proposal that would give all four of the state's electoral votes to whomever won the popular vote nationwide in a presidential election, regardless of whether the majority of Rhode Islanders voted for that candidate. The change is designed to bypass the Electoral College system, which encourages candidates to devote the vast majority of their energy to swing states, where the race is close. States like Rhode Island, where the Democratic candidate typically wins, are ignored. The proposal would not take effect until enough states -- enough to represent a majority of all electoral votes -- agree to the plan. Both the House and Senate have passed comparable versions of the bill but they have to agree on at least one chamber's version before it can go to the governor. During the House debate, Rep. Raymond Gallison, a Democrat from Bristol, asserted that the "National Popular Vote" initiative has widespread support in Rhode Island. "Seventy four percent of Rhode Islanders support [a] national popular vote [for president] because they, as I, believe in one person, one vote," Gallison said. Getting 74 percent of Rhode Islanders to agree on anything controversial would be an accomplishment. But because we had never heard of a poll -- recent or otherwise -- on the issue, we asked Gallison for his source. He told us he would get back to us. Meanwhile, we checked around. We could find only one poll where Rhode Islanders were asked about the topic. It was on the website of National Popular Vote Inc., a "social welfare" nonprofit, tax-exempt organization that paid for the survey. The poll was conducted by Public Policy Polling, a Democratic-leaning survey firm based in North Carolina. Democrats tend to favor popular vote proposals. The question: "There is a proposal to change the way we elect the President. The current system elects a President based on the state-by-state vote totals. The new proposal would switch to a system that elects the President according to the vote totals in all 50 states. Would you generally support or oppose switching to a system that counts the votes in all 50 states combined?" As Gallison reported, 74 percent who responded supported electing the President by a purely popular vote. The margin of error was plus/minus 3.5 percent. But there are a few things to note. The poll was done five years ago. Nobody was interviewed for the survey. The data from 800 registered Rhode Island voters were collected by robocalls, where people hear a recorded message and are asked to respond by pressing a button on their telephone. That means a lot of people were hanging up without answering. Jim Williams, a polling analyst with Public Policy Polling, which did the survey, said about 9 out of every 10 people called typically hang up without answering a question. Perhaps most important, there was no ability for residents to indicate that they were undecided or didn't care. They had two choices: "support" or "oppose." Historically, 12 to 15 percent of the population has had no opinion on the subject, according to older Gallup surveys listed on National Popular Vote's website. Patrick Rosenstiel, spokesman for National Popular Vote, said the survey was designed to force a choice. "We didn't offer an 'undecided' or 'don't know' because a legislator, when the bill comes before them, can't be undecided. They've got to vote green or vote red," he said. The difference is that legislators have time to gather the facts, pro or con, before they are expected to make a choice. The poll offered no such guidance. When Gallison got back to us, he told us that his information came from that 2008 survey. We found a more recent Gallup poll on the question, conducted in October 2011. It posed the question in a way to help ensure that the wording did not affect the outcome and it allowed "undecided" as an option. In that survey, 62 percent supported a national popular vote and 35 percent endorsed keeping the Electoral College system. The rest were undecided. (The margin of error was plus/minus percentage points.) Sixty-two percent is a far cry from 74 percent. But that was a national survey, and Gallison was talking about Rhode Island. Rhode Islanders might feel differently because the Ocean State tends to be awash in Democrats, and Democrats favor the popular vote option. When Gallup only looked at the results for Democrats nationwide, the level of support was 71 percent. During his floor speech, Gallison said 74 percent of Rhode Islanders supported a popular vote because they believed in the concept of one person, one vote. Yet the automated survey didn't ask respondents to give a reason. When we asked Gallison about that, he said his statement was based on comments he had received from constituents who wanted him to vote in favor of the plan. Our ruling Rep. Raymond Gallison said, "Seventy four percent of Rhode Islanders support [a] national popular vote because they, as I, believe in one person, one vote." In the first half of his statement, he was correctly quoting a single five-year-old robocall poll from a special interest group in which respondents only had two options to choose from. Those who didn't know or didn't care either had to either pick an answer -- without the ability to hear arguments pro or con -- or just hang up, as most people do with such surveys. Nonetheless, other surveys have shown a high level of support for a national popular vote, even if it's not quite as high as the percentage quoted by Gallison. The second half of his statement implied that Rhode Islanders had been polled about their reasons for supporting the proposal. But the 2008 survey -- the one Gallison relied on -- never even posed that question. We can think of a few other reasons (such as wanting to bring more campaign money into Rhode Island) why residents might want a national popular vote. Because his statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True.

pomt-07184	By advocating new requirements for voters to show ID cards at the polls, Republicans "want to literally drag us all the way back to Jim Crow laws."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/09/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-compares-gop-backed-votin/	Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla. -- the new chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee -- provoked controversy recently when she compared Republican efforts to heighten scrutiny of voters at the polls to Jim Crow laws -- the primary tool that supported segregation and white supremacy in the South between the 1880s and the 1960s. On June 5, 2011, Wasserman Schultz was interviewed by Roland Martin, an African American political commentator for CNN and the host of a weekly public-affairs show on the TV One cable network. Martin brought up the topic of voter-identification laws. Here’s a portion of their conversation. "Republicans are backing measures that will require photo identification and other types of things, including cutting the number of days for early voting," Martin said. "Republicans say it will cut down on voter fraud. Critics contend it's a step backwards, and it would discriminate against the poor, elderly, students, people with disabilities, and minorities. … Your home state – Gov. Rick Scott is leading one of these efforts, and for the life of me, I don't understand whenever I see Republicans or even Democrats contesting votes and things along those lines. We talk about this is the fundamental right to be Americans, but to put roadblocks up to – to – for voting makes no sense to me." Wasserman Schultz responded, "Well, I mean if you go back to the year 2000, when we had an obvious disaster and – and saw that our voting process needed refinement, and we did that in (the Help America Vote Act) and made sure that we could iron out those kinks -- now you have the Republicans, who want to literally drag us all the way back to Jim Crow laws and literally – and very transparently – block access to the polls to voters who are more likely to vote for Democratic candidates than Republican candidates. And it's nothing short of that blatant." She went on to say that the DNC considers photo ID laws to be "very similar to a poll tax. I mean you look – just look at African-American voters as a snapshot. About 25 percent of African-American voters don't have a valid photo ID. I mean – and – and the reason it's similar to a poll tax is because you've got the expense. You've got the effort. There's difficulties for … many people in getting a photo ID. So, you're literally just throwing a barrier in the way of someone who's trying to exercise their right to vote." Wasserman Schultz continued, "And the reason that it's not necessary is because we already have very legitimate voter verification processes, signature checks that are already in place; and there is so little voter fraud, which is the professed reason the Republicans are advancing these – these laws. There's so little voter fraud, and I mean you're more likely to get hit by lightning than you are to see an instance of voter fraud in this country, but Republicans are imposing laws all over the country, acting like it's not – voter fraud is rampant, and it's ridiculous." Not long after the interview, Republicans pounced on the Jim Crow comparison, arguing that comparing voter ID laws to poll taxes, literacy tests and other Jim Crow laws was not only inaccurate from a policy perspective but was tantamount to calling the GOP racist. Later that day, Wasserman Schultz acknowledged that she had gone too far in her terminology, though she reiterated her opposition to the Republican-backed voter law policies. "Jim Crow was the wrong analogy to use," Wasserman Schultz said. "But I don't regret calling attention to the efforts in a number of states with Republican dominated legislatures, including Florida, to restrict access to the ballot box for all kinds of voters, but particularly young voters, African Americans and Hispanic Americans." In addition to voter ID laws, she and her allies have also criticized proposals that would restrict early voting and place burdens on registration drives. At PolitiFact, we do not typically fact-check statements that are quickly retracted by the speaker. However, we made an exception in this case because we expect voter identification laws and other election-process issues to remain a significant and divisive issue in the 2012 election. For this reason, we thought a historical comparison of Jim Crow laws and today’s voter-identification laws would be of interest to readers (and to us). At this time, we won’t delve deeply into the policy details of the current legislative proposals. Instead, we’re going to focus on the big-picture similarities and differences with Jim Crow laws. To do this, we reached out to about a dozen scholars and found a striking array of opinions, many of them passionate. Some -- many of them historians of the Jim Crow era -- believed that the comparison was justified. Others -- many of them election-law experts -- argued that the comparison was over the top. First, here’s the case for arguing that the current crop of voter laws are similar to Jim Crow laws. • Voting restrictions were the linchpin of Jim Crow. Preventing blacks from voting enabled the subsequent imposition of other segregationist laws. "Exclusion from the franchise was the centerpiece of the system that was put in place in the late 19th century," said Robert Korstad, a Duke University historian and coauthor of Remembering Jim Crow: African Americans Tell About Life in the Segregated South. • Like Jim Crow laws, the new laws are likely to diminish the voter pool. Though the extent is uncertain, most experts agree that some people who would otherwise want to vote will be disenfranchised. And many agree that minorities will be hit disproportionately. The United States is unusual among advanced industrialized countries in promulgating an "enormous discouragement of voting," said Glenda Gilmore, a Yale University professor of history, American Studies and African American Studies and coauthor of Jumpin’ Jim Crow. "Historians of the South use the term ‘Jim Crow laws’ to mean discouraging voting in a way that impacts minority voters. So, I think that she was exactly right in her use of the phrase." In fact, some of the potential legal challenges to today’s new laws will argue they violate the 24th Amendment’s prohibition against the poll tax. • Allegations of fraud were also used to support the initial imposition of Jim Crow voting laws. Jane Dailey, a historian at the University of Chicago and author of Gender and Jim Crow: Women and the Politics of White Supremacy in North Carolina, 1896-1920, agrees that Wasserman Schultz’s comparison "is historically accurate," in part because the justifications were the same. "Groups interested in limiting political competition have always justified suffrage restrictions as necessary checks on election fraud," Dailey said. "Like today's GOP, turn-of-the-century southern Democrats argued that poll taxes and literacy tests would reduce fraud at the polls." • Even laws that are superficially race-neutral can have serious effects on minorities. Many of the Jim Crow voting laws were not explicitly written to favor white voters over black voters, even though they had that practical effect. "There was nothing, on the surface, that made those laws anti-black. It was how they were enforced that became critical," said William H. Chafe, a Duke University historian and coauthor with Korstad of Remembering Jim Crow: African Americans Tell About Life in the Segregated South. "The laws provided political officials with the tools to discriminate against whom they wished." Now, we’ll present the case for arguing that the current crop of voter laws are different from Jim Crow laws. • Jim Crow laws had much higher rates of disenfranchisement. Jim Crow laws disenfranchised all or virtually all of the potential black voters in southern states. Not even critics suggest that will happen today with voter ID laws. "Black voter participation, which in some places had been 90 percent of eligible male voters in the late 1860s and early 1870s, was cut to essentially zero by early decades of 20th century," said Michael J. Klarman, a professor at Harvard Law School and the author of From Jim Crow to Civil Rights: The Supreme Court and the Struggle for Racial Equality. "What Republicans are doing now … is trivial by comparison. They are making it marginally harder for poor people, disproportionately minority, to vote." • It’s much easier for minorities to abide by a voter ID law than a Jim Crow law. Getting an identification card may be a hassle, but it’s not as challenging as learning how to read. "Unlike with Jim Crow laws, there are ways voters can avoid this loss of voting rights," said Rob Richie, the executive director of FairVote, a non-partisan group that works to expand voter turnout and improve how elections are run. Thomas Adams Upchurch -- a historian at East Georgia College and author of several works on race relations in the South, including Legislating Racism: The Billion Dollar Congress and the Birth of Jim Crow-- agreed, saying that "people find the money to afford those things that are important to them, and they make a way to do those things that they value. If people want to vote, they should have a photo ID." • Jim Crow was about much more than just voter disenfranchisement. While laws to restrict voting were an important part of the system of Jim Crow, they were just one part, said James C. Cobb, a University of Georgia historian and author of several books on the South, including The Brown Decision, Jim Crow, And Southern Identity. Legalized discrimination in the South ran the gamut from separate hotels and buses to to unequal schools to separate water fountains. Today, invoking the term Jim Crow in a policy debate seems like an unnecessarily broad -- not to mention provocative -- way for Wasserman Schultz to make her case against voter ID laws. "Jim Crow regimes involved relentless efforts to stop all African Americans from voting and included brutal intimidation tactics, like lynching," said Heather Gerken, a Yale Law School professor who specializes in election law. "I don’t think photo ID rises to that level, and I don’t think she thinks so either." • Jim Crow was unadulterated racism. Voter ID laws are not. Richard Hasen, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles and a specialist in election law, said that intent matters. "Jim Crow laws were intended to hurt African-Americans and make it difficult for them to achieve any political strength," Hasen said. "In contrast, the motives behind the wave of Republican-led voter identification laws and other restrictive voting laws are less clear. At their worst, the laws seem to be motivated to hurt Democrats, including poor and minority voters who tend to vote Democratic," which would make it "partisan, not racial, discrimination." Gerken agreed that there’s a difference between what’s intended to do harm and what might do harm as a side effect. "Photo ID laws are the product of good motives (a desire to prevent fraud) and bad motives (an effort to use election regulations to promote the election chances of the GOP)," Gerken said. "The congresswoman is quite right to worry if they have a disparate effect on African Americans, precisely because they continue to suffer from the continuing effects of past discrimination. But the purpose is quite different. Jim Crow was motivated by pure racial animus. Here, the dominant motive is politics." It’s true that Wasserman Schultz isn’t the only one who’s made the Jim Crow comparison. Editorials in the New York Times, the Miami Herald, the Memphis Commercial Appeal, the Amarillo Globe News have all referenced Jim Crow laws in this context, as have a smattering of politicians. Still, we agree with her ultimate decision to retract her use of the phrase. Even if the ultimate effect of these laws is to decrease voter turnout -- and even if the need to prevent voter fraud is not as dire as the laws’ supporters contend -- Wasserman Schultz’s decision to compare the new crop of laws to Jim Crow went too far. Although there are some similarities in the two sets of laws, they are outweighed both by the differences between them and by the inflammatory nature of the phrase, which all but calls the laws’ supporters racists. The current laws would at worst disenfranchise a fraction of minority voters, not most of them. Unlike with Jim Crow laws, minority voters allow an feasible "out" -- getting an ID card. Wasserman Schultz’s comparison reduces an overwhelming apartheid system to one of its facets, voting laws. And Jim Crow was pure racism, whereas the intent behind today’s proposals is, at most, partisan gain -- albeit at the expense of some would-be voters, many of whom are likely to be minorities. Reasonable people can disagree about the wisdom of the new laws, but they would not return the United States to Jim Crow. Saying so offers more heat than light. On balance, we rate her comment False.

pomt-05328	On abortion	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/15/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-evolved-significantly-his-position-abo/	UPDATE: This article has been changed to reflect that the issues section of Romney's campaign website does address abortion, under the heading "Values." Our ruling remains the same. Mitt Romney has faced years of accusations that he’s flip-flopped on various issues. One issue where Romney has clearly changed his position is abortion. We should note that the Flip-O-Meter rates politicians' consistency on particular topics from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on their decisions to change their minds. It’s simply gauging whether they did. First, we’ll look at some of the things Romney said earlier in his career about abortion, when he was waging a losing bid for a U.S. Senate seat in Massachusetts and winning the governorship a few years later. Here are two of the clearest statements of his position. • In a debate during his 1994 race against Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy, Romney said, "I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country." Referring to the 1973 Supreme Court decision that made abortion legal in every state, Romney added, "I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years, it should be sustained and supported. And I sustain and support that law and support the right of a woman to make that choice." • In his 2002 campaign for governor, Romney said during a debate, "I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard." We believe that these two comments -- made in highly public forums and eight years apart -- represent pretty solid evidence that Romney was an abortion-rights supporter during that phase of his political career. (A few other media sources that provide a detailed accounting of the nuances of Romney’s abortion views can be found here and here.) What about Romney’s views today? Romney wrote a June 18, 2011, op-ed in the conservative National Review that lays out his abortion views in detail. "I am pro-life and believe that abortion should be limited to only instances of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. I support the reversal of Roe v. Wade, because it is bad law and bad medicine. Roe was a misguided ruling that was a result of a small group of activist federal judges legislating from the bench. I support the Hyde Amendment, which broadly bars the use of federal funds for abortions. And as president, I will support efforts to prohibit federal funding for any organization like Planned Parenthood, which primarily performs abortions or offers abortion-related services. "I will reinstate the Mexico City Policy to ensure that nongovernmental organizations that receive funding from America refrain from performing or promoting abortion services as a method of family planning, in other countries. This includes ending American funding for any United Nations or other foreign assistance program that promotes or performs abortions on women around the world. "I will advocate for and support a Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act to protect unborn children who are capable of feeling pain from abortion. And perhaps most importantly, I will only appoint judges who adhere to the Constitution and the laws as they are written, not as they want them to be written." Romney repeated strong anti-abortion views throughout the 2012 presidential primaries. For instance, during a town meeting in Hopkinton, N.H., on Oct. 10, 2011, Romney answered a question about his position on abortion this way: "What I would like to see happen would be for the Supreme Court to say, look, we’re going to overturn Roe v. Wade and return to the states the authority to decide whether they want to have abortion or not, state by state. That’s the way it was before Roe v. Wade. So I am firmly pro-life." And on his campaign website, Romney said he "believes that life begins at conception and wishes that the laws of our nation reflected that view. But while the nation remains so divided, he believes that the right next step is for the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade – a case of blatant judicial activism that took a decision that should be left to the people and placed it in the hands of unelected judges. With Roe overturned, states will be empowered through the democratic process to determine their own abortion laws and not have them dictated by judicial mandate." It’s also worth noting that Romney has not denied a change of heart on abortion. He traces it to a statehouse meeting with Harvard University stem-cell researcher Douglas Melton on Nov. 9, 2004. By Romney’s account, he was stunned to hear Melton say that "we kill the embryos after 14 days." (Two years after the meeting, Melton sharply contradicted that account, telling the Boston Globe that Romney "mischaracterized" his position and saying that he and Romney "didn't discuss killing or anything related to it. I explained my work to him, told him about my deeply held respect for life, and explained that my work focuses on improving the lives of those suffering from debilitating diseases." An exhaustive journalistic review of Romney’s stances on abortion by Slate’s William Saletan, however, suggests that Romney’s view of what transpired in the meeting is plausible.) In an interview with the conservative blog RedState in September 2006, Romney said, "My position changed during the stem-cell research debate. The provost of Harvard and the head of stem-cell research came into my office and at one point said that stem-cell research was not a moral issue because they killed the embryo at 14 days. And it hit me hard at that very moment that the Roe v. Wade philosophy had cheapened the value of human life. And I said to my chief of staff, who was with me in the meeting, as we came outside, ‘I am no longer content with the description of my position. I want to call myself pro-life.’ " Our ruling Romney’s views on abortion are significantly different today than what he expressed in the 1994 and 2002 debates. Indeed, Romney has acknowledged that his views on abortion have changed over the years. His shift in position on abortion rates a Full Flop.

The company publishes and distributes coupon books, including the popular Chinook Book. Company president Nik Blosser said that he doesn’t use the co-owner term. But he confirmed that Brady is the third largest individual who is a shareholder in the company. He and co-founder Tom Koehler invited Brady to join their board nearly a decade ago, and she has been chairwoman since. "So she has and has had a key leadership role in the company, and she's an investor herself," Blosser said. Who are we to argue with that? Brady’s claim is accurate. We rule the statement True.

pomt-06077	"We're only inches away from no longer being a free economy."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/08/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-once-again-says-us-inches-away-no-long/	Mitt Romney continues to repeat the talking point that the United States is "only inches away from no longer being a free economy." But we’ve ruled it Pants on Fire twice-- and now he's achieved a PolitiFact hat trick. During the Jan. 7, 2012, Republican presidential debate in Manchester, N.H., former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney once again stated, "We're only inches away from no longer being a free economy." Previously, Romney had said essentially the same thing during a Republican presidential debate in Ames, Iowa, on Aug. 11, 2011, and in his June 2, 2011, presidential announcement at a farm in Stratham, N.H. As we indicated when we first checked this claim in June, we at PolitiFact tolerate a bit of hyperbole from politicians on all sides when they’re trying to make a point. So we’re not literally using a ruler to measure distances here. However, we decided that the underlying question -- whether the United States could really be approaching socialism -- is a fair one to analyze. Here are some of the statistics to consider: Government spending On the suggestion of several economists, we took the figures for government expenditures (which includes all levels of government) and divided them by the national gross domestic product for the years 1996 through 2010. For more than a decade, government spending as a percentage of GDP was quite stable, bouncing between 30.4 percent and 32.9 percent. For the last few years, that percentage has indeed gone up -- to roughly 38 percent in both 2009 and 2010, which is within striking distance of the 40 percent Romney cited. Bruce Bartlett, a former official in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, told us at the time that Romney is "implying that the temporary increase in spending from (Obama’s stimulus bill) and the consequences of the recession are permanent," Bartlett said. Other economists noted that government’s footprint in GDP started growing in 2008 -- under Bush, not Obama -- because that’s when the recession began to hit. And even if the government share of GDP is close to 40 percent, would that be a catastrophe for economic freedom? Most of the experts we spoke to scoffed at the suggestion. "It has long been the conservative view that there is only so much freedom out there and if government grows in size then this necessarily diminishes freedom," Bartlett said. "Thus if spending is 25 percent of GDP, then we are three-quarters free, and if it grows to 40 percent, then we have lost 15 percent of our freedom and are only 60 percent free. This, of course, is nonsense, because it implies that the greatest freedom exists in anarchy … and that freedom is the only thing anyone cares about." Here are a few other statistics to consider. Taxes Taxes offer another measure of government involvement into the economy. According to the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that studies tax policy, the total federal, state and local tax burden has been falling -- not rising -- in recent years. Every year, the group computes a national figure for all levels of taxation as a share of national income. The data shows that the tax burden has fallen modestly in recent years, from 31.2 percent in 2006 to 27.2 percent in 2011. And as we concluded in a separate fact-check, the U.S. tax burden isn’t just hovering around a historical low -- it’s also low compared to other advanced industrialized nations. In a 2006 international comparison, 25 nations had a higher percentage of taxes compared to GDP than the U.S., while just four -- Mexico, Japan, Korea and Turkey -- had a lower percentage. Regulation "One loses being a free market economy not so much, or not solely, because of the level of spending and taxation, but also by the level and reach of government regulation, and by the distortions to choices that arise through government policy -- think of tax rules that discourage some behaviors and investments in favor of others," said J.D. Foster, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation. Tevi Troy, a senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute, said that bailouts for Wall Street and U.S. automakers (approved under Bush and continued under Obama) and the increasing government oversight over the health care sector (approved under Obama) represent nearly unprecedented willingness by the government to intervene in the economy. (Supporters, of course, counter that all but the health care intervention were intended to be temporary and came in response to a dire situation.) However, there’s strong evidence undercutting Romney's claim that comes from, of all places, the conservative Heritage Foundation. Heritage published an economic freedom index for 2011-- an international ranking of nations using a combination of 10 types of statistics, covering business freedom, trade freedom, fiscal freedom, government spending, monetary freedom, investment freedom, financial freedom, property rights, freedom from corruption and labor freedom. Certainly, different groups could measure freedom differently. But let’s look at what Heritage concluded. The U.S. ranked ninth out of 179 nations on the list, with a score that placed it near the top of the "mostly free" category. The only nations to be considered more "free" than the U.S. were, in descending order, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Canada, Ireland, and Denmark. If the results of this study -- which, we’ll remind readers, was produced by a staunchly conservative think tank -- suggest that the U.S. is on the verge of socialism, then Lenin must be partying in his mauseoleum. For the U.S. to fall into the "mostly unfree" category, which is only the third-lowest category in the study, it would have to drop a whopping 83 slots, to a perch below such nations as Albania, Rwanda and Kazakhstan. We did hear one argument that provided a measure of support for Romney’s position -- but only in a backhanded way. Eugene Steuerle, an economist with the Urban Institute, a think tank that does economic and social policy research, said Romney’s comparison is imperfect because over the past century, there really hasn’t been a golden age in which the economy was genuinely unfettered, so the U.S. really couldn't be inching away from such an age. "We’ve been a mixed economy for a long time," Steuerle said. "The ‘free market’ is a somewhat vague term. Technically, a Federal Reserve system and an antitrust division of the Justice Department interfere with a totally free market economy, yet they may promote a competitive economy." Our ruling It’s true that the government’s footprint on spending has grown over the past few years, due in large part to the recession. But while the statistics show that the government continues to have a large influence on the economy, there is little indication that the government’s role has risen dramatically enough over the past few years to threaten the kind of free market that the U.S. has operated under in recent decades. And international comparisons show that the U.S. ranks low in both total tax burden and high in economic freedom -- at least as measured by a prominent conservative think tank. Last June and August, we found this claim to merit a Pants on Fire. Nothing has changed our view. We rate Romney's statement Pants on Fire. EDITOR’S NOTE: The quote we used from Tevi Troy was made on June 2, 2011. After this article was published, we learned that Troy subsequently joined the Romney campaign as an adviser, according to POLITICO.

pomt-01630	Each Georgia taxpayer would have to send $5,000 to the treasury to cover the state’s debt.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2014/aug/27/truth-accounting/georgias-finances-not-alarming-report-suggests/	Outside rankings of Georgia have fueled the fire of some of this year’s political campaigns. Republican Gov. Nathan Deal has boasted that both the little-known magazine Site Selection and media heavyweight CNBC have deemed Georgia the top place in the nation to do business. Democratic challenger Jason Carter questioned the political mileage of the rankings, saying they mask other problems such as an unemployment rate that ranks 50th out of 50 states and the District of Columbia. Now the nonpartisan think tank Truth in Accounting in Chicago has released a study blasting Georgia for carrying a nearly $16 billion debt burden, mostly from unfunded pension and retiree health care liabilities. It ranks Georgia’s financial condition as the 28th worst among all states. "In order to fill this financial hole, each Georgia taxpayer would have to send $5,000 to the state’s treasury," according to a summary of the study. Who has that kind of coin lying around? PolitiFact Georgia sure doesn’t. But how is it the state have both a balanced budget requirement and that kind of debt? Sheila Weinberg, the certified public accountant who founded TIA, thinks the problem lies with Georgia (and other states) not including long-term pension and retiree health care compensation in the annual budget. Georgia’s audited financial report shows $2 billion in retirement benefits. But Weinberg claims by adding in those other compensations, the state has more than $14 billion of unfunded retirement programs over the next three decades. Every state has that kind of long-term obligation. Now, those unfunded liabilities are in the footnotes of the financial statements filed yearly. The Government Accounting Standards board, though, is changing those accounting rules. Pension liabilities will be on the balance sheets starting with the 2014 reports. If Georgia followed those standards this year, the state Employees Retirement System, or ERS, would show a $4.8 billion unfunded liability. But those rules affect only how those debts are reported. It doesn’t change their totals or decide the policies on funding them. In Georgia, pension funding is governed by state law, which requires an actuary to calculate the annual required minimum contribution to meet the long-term obligation. As of 2013, Georgia also adds extra cash to that minimum, amortized over 25 years, to fill the gap. The state sets aside that money first, before determining the rest of the budget. It has never failed to do so. The ERS – which covers 60,000 active members and 45,000 retirees – was 71.4 percent funded in 2013. That puts it just shy of the 72 percent average for the nation’s largest pension funds and among those funds considered well-funded for the future, according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. "Our contributions come in like clockwork every year," said Jim Potvin, the ERS’ executive director. "The support has come from multiple administrations literally spanning decades." But if pension costs are obligated, retiree healthcare costs are optional. The TIA study projects the retiree health care liability at $7.4 billion. It would require changes to state law – most likely to reduce benefits – to lower that cost. Alan Essig, executive director of the left-leaning Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, said such changes are far more likely than the option of tax hikes in our fiscally conservative state. "It’s not as if we have to pay tomorrow," Essig said. "We have 30 years to plan budgetarily and change policy to meet our obligations." In other words, Georgia has never missed its obligations on retiree health care or pension, and there is no reason to expect that will change anytime soon. And, since no one expects Georgia taxpayers to march downtown and make a lump sum payment, the report’s calculations strike some as a silly exercise. There is value in discussing the obligations, said Alicia H. Munnell, the executive director of the Center for Retirement Research. But a more useful exercise would be to have a separate discussion about ways to pay the debt long-term. Georgia, Munnell said, has already had many of those discussions that resulted in the existing laws and policies that have it on the right financial track. "The whole report has this alarmist tone, as if they’ve discovered something new," Munnell said. "Really, Georgia should be proud of itself for being fairly prudently managed to pay off its debts." So, that $5,000 bill facing Georgia taxpayers? It’s a great way to get us to pay attention to the promises we’ve made with public dollars. The statement suggests that the state is being reckless, or that a one-time payment is coming soon. That is not the case. Georgia has been thoughtful about its looming obligations and positioned itself to pay down those debts over time. For that reason, we rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-02261	When Republicans last controlled the presidency and Congress, "the number of people on food stamps (and) the number of people in low-income housing went through the roof."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/apr/10/glenn-grothman/when-gop-last-ran-washington-rolls-food-stamps-sub/	State Sen. Glenn Grothman caused a commotion among fellow Republicans when he announced he would try to oust 35-year GOP congressman Tom Petri in the August 2014 primary election. A brash, self-proclaimed tea party conservative, Grothman contrasts with the more low-key Petri, whom the Daily Beast called "the last Rockefeller Republican on Capitol Hill." On April 4, 2014, the day after his announcement, Grothman was asked why he is running for the seat, which represents a district in eastern Wisconsin that is north of Milwaukee and Madison. He blamed Republicans. "Like a lot of people, I am frustrated with what’s going on in Washington. I’m not frustrated with the gridlock as much as frustrated with our national Republicans," Grothman told Jay Weber, a conservative radio talk show host on WISN-AM (1130) in Milwaukee. "I mean, in a lot of ways, I think the country is in deep trouble. And it’s not just a bad economy or the huge amount of debt. You have, I think, kind of social ills that have been encouraged by bad federal policies. And I’m thinking about the out-of-control entitlements that have led to a complete breakdown of the family and so many segments of society. "The Republicans, I don’t think, are doing enough to articulate the size of the problem," Grothman continued, before uttering the claim we decided to check. "And when the Republicans were last in control – from like 2001 to 2007, when they had the president, the House and the Senate – they really only made matters worse. During that time, the number of people on food stamps, the number of people in low-income housing went through the roof." So, let’s see if there was huge growth in food stamps and low-income housing during the period Grothman cites and, if so, whether the GOP was responsible. Party control As Grothman indicated, Republicans were mostly in control in Washington from 2001 to 2007, with George W. Bush in the White House and GOP majorities in the House. But in the Senate, Democrats held a 51-49 majority for about a year and a half during that period. The power shift occurred in June 2001 after Vermont Sen. James Jeffords left the GOP, became an independent and caucused with the Democrats. The 51-49 edge went back to the GOP in mid-November 2002 when Republican James Talent won a Senate seat in Missouri. Republicans maintained control through the 2005-’07 congressional session (Democrats retook the Senate in the 2007-’09 Congress.) Now to the two parts of Grothman’s claim. Food stamps U.S. Department of Agriculture figures show the average number of food stamp recipients increased in each year between 2001 and 2006, before edging downward in 2007. 2001: 17.3 million 2002: 19.1 million 2003: 21.3 million 2004: 23.8 million 2005: 25.6 million 2006: 26.5 million 2007: 26.3 million The number of people on food stamps was 52 percent higher in 2007 than it was in 2001. And that came after a six-year span, from 1995 to 2001, when the number of food stamp recipients declined by 35 percent. Changes in policy were important in the increase during the 2001-’07 period Grothman cited. In rating as True a claim that food stamp spending doubled under Bush and doubled again under President Barack Obama, PolitiFact National found that lawmakers in 2002 had rolled back some food stamp eligibility restrictions. And a Bush adviser told our colleagues the administration’s goal at the time was to expand food programs for low-income working families and make it easier for states to administer the program and get more eligible people signed up. Michael Tanner of the libertarian Cato Institute and Stacy Dean of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities told us the economy and Bush policies were factors. Tanner put more weight on the policies, while Dean cited both factors. So, there’s evidence to back the first part of Grothman’s claim. Low-income housing When we asked for evidence on the second part of the claim, Grothman admitted he didn’t have figures on the number of people living in low-income housing, but assumed the number had increased because more tax credits were made available to developers of low-income housing units. More specifically, Congress in 2001 increased by 40 percent -- from $1.25 to $1.75 per person -- and indexed to inflation a tax credit that states could allocate towards funding low-income housing. But Grothman’s statement was much broader than one specific program. He said that the number of people living in low-income housing -- not just those benefitting from one particular program -- was way up. So that’s how we’re evaluating that part of his claim. Figures from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development count the number of people living in all types of HUD-subsidized housing, including those in units built with low-income tax credits as well as in units covered by the rent-subsidy Section 8 program and other programs. The number rose from 8.49 million in 2000 to 9.39 million in 2007. The 2007 figure is 10.6 percent higher. That’s not a staggering increase, but it certainly is a significant one. Barbara Sard, vice president for housing policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said much of the increase was due to an increase in subsidized-housing vouchers authorized by Congress from 1999 to 2001 (when the GOP controlled both chambers and Democrat Bill Clinton was president). The Cato Institute’s Mark Calabria, a staff member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs during about half the period Grothman cited, noted the tax credit expansion that Grothman cited. He also said the Bush administration added more housing vouchers and congressional Republicans didn’t move to curtail spending on housing assistance. Our rating Grothman said that when Republicans last controlled the presidency and Congress, from roughly 2001 to 2007, "the number of people on food stamps (and) the number of people in low-income housing went through the roof." After having declined for a number of years, the number of people receiving food stamps increased 52 percent during the period, as the Bush administration and Congress widened eligibility and encouraged more eligible people to apply. The increase in people living in low-income housing was more modest, but still significant. We rate Grothman’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-03625	Says state’s mandated tests come from an English company.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/may/06/george-lavender/george-lavender-says-english-company-supplies-texa/	During a legislative session marked by backlash against state-mandated testing, Rep. George Lavender offered an amendment to drop some Texas exams for an Iowa alternative. "I think we need to get at least an American company doing our tests instead of an English company," the Texarkana Republican said April 29, 2013, during debate on a House bill to cut and shorten some tests given under the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness. The bill won House approval, but without Lavender’s amendment to substitute the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills for certain STAAR exams, which was tabled. Does an English company provide Texas’ tests? Since September 1981, according to histories of Texas testing on the education agency’s website, the state’s primary contractor for statewide assessment programs has been the same: the company known today as NCS Pearson, Inc. By phone, Lavender told us, "I know they have a lot of employees in Texas and I know they have a lot of employees worldwide, but the fact is that they’re a British company, and I would much prefer a U.S.-based company to be doing our testing." The Texas program isn’t functioning as intended, he said, and there are other tests that "have been proven to work across the country." Susan Aspey, vice president of public affairs for New York-based Pearson North America, told us by phone, "Pearson PLC is the parent company. It is based in the U.K. Pearson’s North American education businesses are based here in North America. Pearson’s testing businesses are based in Minnesota. In the state of Texas, Pearson employs 1,800 people." Specifically, NCS Pearson is incorporated in Minnesota, she said. Corporate websites and profiles from Bloomberg Businessweek show the company is headquartered in Bloomington, Minn., and was founded in 1962 as National Computer Systems to score psychology diagnostic tests; the name changed to NCS Pearson in 2000 when it was bought by U.K. company Pearson PLC. Pearson PLC today is a global education services company headquartered at 80 Strand in London that also owns book publisher Penguin and the Financial Times news organization. It listed 42,980 employees in its 2012 annual report, including 18,552 in "North American education" and 16,751 in "international education." Aspey said, "Pearson employs three times as many people in the U.S. as it does in the U.K." Under NCS Pearson’s 2010-2015 contract with Texas’ schools agency, the company will be paid $468 million for STAAR and Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) tests and services. Two of the largest subcontracted amounts were listed as going to online learning company Desire2Learn, based in Canada, and Chicago-based communications firm RR Donnelley. And who writes the STAAR tests? Three subcontractors plus Texas educators, agency spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe told us by email. Items for the test are drafted, she said, by the San Antonio-based K-12 Education Division of a global, private organization, the Princeton, N.J.-headquartered nonprofit Educational Testing Service, and two companies named Lone Star and Tri-Lin Integrated Services. Then they’re edited by the agency and committees of Texas educators, Ratcliffe said. Our ruling Lavender said the state’s mandatory tests come from an English company. Pearson, the parent company of Texas’ testing contractor, is English. Then again, NCS Pearson is incorporated in Minnesota and was American-owned until 2000. Also, test items are generated by subcontractors including the San Antonio division of a global organization headquartered in New Jersey. Lacking these clarifications, the statement rates as Mostly True.	None	George Lavender	None	None	None	2013-05-06T10:34:54	2013-04-29	['England']

pomt-03752	Says that his transportation budget and Ohio Turnpike plan "would make sure we have lower tolls than we’ve had through the history of the turnpike."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2013/apr/08/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-says-his-turnpike-plan-would-lower/	After some tinkering by the General Assembly, Gov. John Kasich on April 1 signed into law a two-year transportation budget that charts a new future for the state-owned Ohio Turnpike. Kasich’s signature -- and his line-item veto of an annual reimbursement to railroad operators -- ended months of debate and speculation about what would make the final version. Despite early talk of privatization, the turnpike will remain a public asset. The bill also raises the speed limit to 70 mph on rural highways and aims to raise billions of dollars for road projects. But questions remain, and that brings us to Kasich’s recent appearance on "State of Ohio," a weekly program produced by Cleveland’s WVIZ ideastream and its Statehouse News Bureau. During an interview, the Republican governor told host Karen Kasler that his proposal "would make sure we have lower tolls than we’ve had through the history of the turnpike." The claim caught our ear because the plan, as has been reported by The Plain Dealer and others, calls for tolls to increase for at least 10 years. Was Kasich taking us out for a spin? PolitiFact Ohio decided to find out how the Truth-O-Meter tolls. Kasich taped the interview March 20, the same day the Senate approved a conference committee report that shaped the final version of his transportation budget. The House approved the report a day later. The bill did not change between March 20 and the April 1 signing. So let’s examine the crux of Kasich’s turnpike plan. The bill approved by the legislature allows the state, for the first time, to use revenue from the Ohio Turnpike for projects beyond the 241-mile toll road. By raising tolls in each of the next 10 years, Ohio can issue $1.5 billion in bonds to help pay for transportation initiatives that might have been delayed a decade or longer. Kasich hopes to leverage that bond money into an equal amount of federal and local cash, creating a $3 billion pot for roads and bridges in coming years. The new law requires that 90 percent of the money be spent within 75 miles of the turnpike. The governor projects the work will support 65,000 jobs. And he hinted April 1 that Opportunity Corridor, a long-planned link from Interstate 490 through Cleveland to University Circle, might benefit. So what about those "lower tolls" Kasich mentioned in his TV interview? Here’s where it gets complicated. If you have an E-ZPass, the bill freezes your tolls for the next 10 years on trips of 30 miles or less. But that only applies to passenger cars -- not commercial trucks. For all others, the intention is to raise tolls at no more than the rate of inflation. Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols cited these stipulations when PolitiFact Ohio asked about the governor’s remarks. Over 20 years, tolls have risen "almost three times the rate of inflation for cars," Nichols said, attributing the figure to a state-commissioned turnpike analysis. The 2012 report from KPMG Corporate Finance LLC found that between 1993 and 2012, the rolling average increase in Ohio toll rates per mile was 7.2 percent for passenger cars. "The increase in toll rates outpaced the average annual growth of CPI [the Consumer Price Index], which was 2.5% over the same time period," the KPMG report states. KPMG now estimates annual CPI growth for the Midwest at 2.7 percent. Essentially, the Kasich administration intends to follow this inflation measure when capping future increases. But "intends" is a key word here. Kasich did not favor writing the cap into law and lawmakers tabled an amendment that would have done so. Nichols said such language makes bond lawyers nervous. The bill also allows the state to lift the 10-year freeze on local E-ZPass tolls if "necessary to comply with covenants in bond proceedings in existence before July 1, 2013." Despite bond market concerns, the Turnpike Commission is expected to commit to the inflation cap in a resolution that will be introduced at a meeting this week, Nichols said. While that would have less authority than legislation, Nichols accurately noted that any future governor, General Assembly or turnpike regime could undo any of the Kasich administration’s measures. One last fact to consider. The 10-year freeze on short E-ZPass trips is not likely to benefit many turnpike motorists -- at least not to start. Only about 30 percent of the turnpike’s passenger car transactions come through the electronic payment system, according to KPMG. Kasich said his plan would "make sure we have lower tolls than we had through the history of that turnpike." Yes, the bill aims to keep tolls from rising faster than the pace of inflation -- a practice that would stand in contrast to KPMG’s findings from the past 20 years. And, yes, the bill freezes tolls for 10 years on a small, targeted cross-section of turnpike users. But not only are higher tolls a part of Kasich’s plan, they are integral to the concept. The increased revenue will allow the state to issue bonds to finance other projects. Furthermore, the inflation cap is not written into the law, and the state has an out from the local EZ-Pass freeze. Ohio Turnpike drivers might be getting a better deal than they were before. But future tolls that do not climb as quickly as they might have in the past are not lower tolls. It’s not only misleading but ridiculous for Kasich to portray it that way.

pomt-12096	Says Rick Kriseman is $35 million over budget on St. Petersburg’s new police station.	false	/florida/statements/2017/aug/25/rick-baker/former-mayor-rick-baker-wrongly-says-new-police-he/	All summer long, Rick Baker has hammered opponent and current Mayor Rick Kriseman over what he sees as exorbitant spending on the new pier and new police station. In a Tampa Bay Times article on June 14, Baker said: "To me it's all about quality of life. Whether it's dog parks, skate board parks, rec centers ... And the trouble is, if you're $35 million over budget on the Pier and $35 million over budget on a police station, it's very hard to do that stuff." Kriseman, on the other hand, argued the police station is under budget and ahead of schedule — a premature statement that we rated Mostly False. Here, we wanted to test Baker’s claim that the city is over budget on the police station. Two stations, two estimates Plans for a new police station have been in the works since Baker was mayor more than a decade ago. The city’s police building on 1300 First Ave. N. was built in multiple phases, with the first part unveiled in 1951 and the other in 1978. Baker argues the current budget is way more than what was originally determined in 2006, when he was in his second term. The estimate to replace the police station came in at $50 million, according to the Tampa Bay Times. The latest price tag to replace the aging station is $86 million. That’s about $35 million higher than the 2006 estimate. Contrary to Baker’s point, the expected price hike does not prove dramatic cost overruns driven by the current mayor. Baker’s point essentially compares two different projects, holding Kriseman to an estimate that low-balled the expected costs and obviously pre-dated him. Most of the price hike happened before Kriseman took office The city knew years before Kriseman became mayor that it would take more than $50 million to replace police headquarters. In 2010, a consultant hired by the city unveiled a report detailing that St. Petersburg needed to spend $74 million to replace its police headquarters. Given the state of the economy, city officials knew the $74 million price tag was too steep. "I don't think we can afford this," said City Council member Karl Nurse in 2010. As the economic downturn set in, the city looked at other options, including building a scaled-down version while making updates to the old facility. However, after the economy picked back up, Kriseman announced in 2015 the city would have enough money to build a new station again for $70 million. After the budget was set at $70 million (a decision approved by the City Council 7-1), additional costs were added for parking, energy efficient features, and a new shooting range, bringing the final budget for new police facilities to $86 million. Here’s how the budget changed over the years: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com To Baker, this does not matter. "The bottom line is the budget was $50 million dollars for the police station, anything the department needed, should have been built into that initial $50 million dollar budget, period," said Rick Baker. "The fact that Kriseman is playing budgetary games does not hide the fact that, as documented by the Tampa Bay Times on multiple occasions, he is on a ‘spending binge,’ and is tens of millions of dollars over budget on the police station project." Budget adjustments are not synonymous with being over budget, though. The city is not yet anticipating to spend more than what the council approved. The city says it has spent $4 million towards the construction of the project, which started in late spring. Construction costs eat up the majority of the budget, at $61 million. The rest of the spending is for architecture, planning and other services related to the pre-development of the project. City officials estimated the project will be done in December 2018, and fully operational in spring 2019. Baker is not alone in criticizing the added features cooked into the final project. His staff highlighted how the Tampa Bay Times editorial board criticized Kriseman’s spending on the police station and pier. The editorial does not call the police project over budget. Our ruling Baker said that the new police headquarters is over budget. Baker considers the budget for the police department to be $50 million, which was the amount that was originally set aside in 2006 when he was mayor. However, before Kriseman took office, a consultant said the city would need $74 million to build a new police headquarters. With the addition of features such as a shooting range and a parking garage, the project’s expected cost is now $86 million. Baker’s insistence that Kriseman should have stuck to a budget developed 11 years ago ignores the changed expectations before Kriseman took office. Moreover, the city is not far enough along on the project to say that it is over budget. So far, there’s no indication that the city is spending more than what the council approved. Baker’s statement is inaccurate. We rate this claim False. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Rick Baker	None	None	None	2017-08-25T11:30:18	2017-06-14	['None']

pomt-12010	Says Ted Cruz is the "same senator who once supported a ban on sex toys."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2017/sep/21/new-york-post/mostly-false-ted-cruz-same-senator-who-once-suppor/	Among darts tossed at Sen. Ted Cruz after his Twitter account "liked" a sexual video clip is an allegation that Cruz has backed a ban on sex toys. The New York Post, among news outlets tracking the moment, tweeted: "This is the same senator who once supported a ban on sex toys." We’re unaware of Sen. Cruz, elected in 2012 and seeking re-election in 2018, calling for a ban on sex toys. So, what was the Post talking about? The Post’s tweet linked to the newspaper’s Sept. 12, 2017, news story, which said, without added detail: "Cruz, a Republican from Texas, is known for his strong religious convictions and family values stance — and once even supported a ban on sex toys." Cruz calls claim ‘totally false’ Cruz did not respond to our inquiry for this fact-check. But he objected on Sept. 13, 2017, when CNN’s Dana Bash asked: "Do you appreciate the irony that you once defended a Texas law banning sales of sex toys?" "No," Cruz said. "That’s a good example, Dana, where the media runs with things that are just totally false." He elaborated that at one time, his duties as solicitor general for the Texas attorney general’s office included defending state laws. "One of those laws was a law restricting the sale of sex toys. It’s a stupid law," Cruz said, adding that he believes consenting adults should do what they please in the privacy of their bedrooms. To get our own fix on Cruz’s actions, we turned to news accounts, a legal brief, an appeals court ruling and an extensive April 2016 Mother Jones story about Cruz’s role in a decade-old case that didn’t rise to the Supreme Court. Law upheld, then found unconstitutional At issue: The State of Texas defending section 43.23 of the state’s penal code, which states: "A person commits an offense if, knowing its content and character, he wholesale promotes or possesses with intent to wholesale promote any obscene material or obscene device." After a U.S. district judge dismissed a challenge to the law, businesses selling sex toys appealed to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where a three-judge panel, by 2-1, agreed with the business-plaintiffs and found the law in violation of the 14th Amendment right to privacy. The state didn’t appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. February 2008 news accounts from the Associated Press and Austin American-Statesman said the ruling overturned the state’s ban on sex toys. Under the spurned law, the American-Statesman story said, it had been illegal to sell, advertise, give or lend obscene devices, defined as a device used primarily for sexual stimulation. "Anyone in possession of six or more sexual devices is considered to be promoting them," the story said, adding that the law dated to the 1970s and had seldom been enforced. Cruz’s role And what was Cruz’s role? Cruz, who had been solicitor general since 2003, didn’t present the state’s oral argument before the appellate panel, according to two attorneys involved in the dispute, Louis Sirkin, who represented businesses challenging the law, and James C. Todd, a since-retired assistant attorney general who defended the law in district court. Todd and Sirkin each told us the oral argument was given by another state lawyer, Bill L. Davis. In ruling against the state, the appellate judges cited Lawrence and Garner v. Texas, the U.S. Supreme Court's 2003 opinion striking down bans on consensual sex between gay couples. "Just as in Lawrence," the judges wrote, "the state here wants to use its laws to enforce a public moral code by restricting private intimate conduct. The case is not about public sex. It is not about controlling commerce in sex. It is about controlling what people do in the privacy of their own homes because the state is morally opposed to a certain type of consensual private intimate conduct. This is an insufficient justification after Lawrence." Appeals brief Earlier, the state framed its arguments for upholding the law in a January 2007 brief listing the names of the then-attorney general, Greg Abbott, and five state attorneys working for the agency helmed by Abbott -- including Cruz, Todd and Davis, whose signature alone appears on the brief and, again alone, on the state’s unsuccessful post-ruling motion for rehearing. Our request to interview Davis didn’t draw a reply from Attorney General Ken Paxton’s office. The state’s brief notes that no state law bars the private use of sexual devices nor is there a limit on advertising such products to meet medical needs. It’s the government’s legitimate interest to guard against the commercial sale of sex and "discouraging prurient interests in sexual gratification" and "protecting minors," the brief says. Further, the brief says, the First Amendment doesn’t protect commercial speech related to unlawful activity. The brief also says, in bold: "There is no substantive-due-process right to stimulate one’s genitals for non-medical reasons unrelated to procreation or outside of an interpersonal relationship." This section of the brief goes on to say the Supreme Court hasn’t identified such a right. Lawyers comment To our inquiries, Todd and Gary Krupkin, a Dallas First Amendment lawyer who represents businesses selling such products, each commented by phone that Cruz supported restricting sex toys but that defending state laws also was his duty. "Obviously," Todd said, "the solicitor general doesn’t write every brief. There’s no doubt in my mind that Cruz would have reviewed it in some way," he said. So, Todd said, Cruz "defended it. A lawyer’s name on the brief means something. He was on it near the top, right under Greg Abbott’s. He was responsible for assigning the case. He would have been responsible for supervising the" respective "lawyer." It ultimately was Cruz’s duty to defend the law, each lawyer said. And that’s "regardless of his beliefs," Todd said. "Our job in the attorney general’s office was to make whatever case there is to be made about the law." Krupkin said: "Cruz in his official capacity as solicitor general supported a ban. It gets too close to the line when you say Ted Cruz" personally "did this. Ted Cruz did that in his official position. I myself see a difference between the two," he said. Our ruling The Post’s tweet called Cruz "the same senator who once supported a ban on sex toys." This statement incorrectly suggests that Cruz called for a ban on sex toys while serving in the Senate or otherwise personally held that belief. We find no evidence to support that contention. In his position as a state lawyer, still, Cruz helped unsuccessfully defend a Texas law barring commercial promotion of sex toys--an action giving this claim an element of truth.

pomt-14760	"Under conservative leadership, Congress has reduced the federal deficit by 60 percent – nearly $800 billion."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/dec/11/american-action-network/conservatives-slashed-federal-deficit-60-group-say/	A national "dark money" group ran a pro-Paul Ryan ad in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that credits conservatives for slashing the federal deficit. Conservatives? A Democrat has been in the White House since 2009 and Democrats have controlled the U.S. Senate for most of the time since then. Of course, House Republicans such as Ryan have played a key role in the federal budget. So let’s see what the American Action Network is talking about. The network’s ad The Washington, D.C.-based group, founded in 2010 by former Republican U.S. Sen. Norm Coleman of Minnesota, says it promotes "center-right solutions to our nation’s challenges." It is a so-called dark-money nonprofit in that it is not required to disclose the names of its donors. The group ran ads against Democrat Russ Feingold in 2010, who lost his U.S. Senate seat later that year to Republican Ron Johnson. The group’ half-page ad ran in the Journal Sentinel on Dec. 7 and 8, 2015 and is said to be part of a $3 million national campaign. The attention-getting photo at the top of the ad shows 26 older white people and carried this headline: "What’s the top priority of the new leadership in Congress? Fighting for the conservative principles that keep America strong." The ad also featured a picture of Ryan and urged readers to thank the newly installed speaker of the House for "making America stronger." It said the Janesville Republican is working with conservatives in Congress to "rein in runaway spending," then made this claim: "Under conservative leadership, Congress has reduced the federal deficit by 60 percent – nearly $800 billion." Network’s evidence As a reminder, the federal deficit is the difference in a given year between the government’s receipts and its expenditures. That’s different from the debt, an accumulation of deficits that is approaching $19 trillion. To back its claim, the American Action Network compared the deficit in 2010 to 2015, citing figures from a gold-standard source, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. We’ll note that the federal fiscal year starts Oct. 1 and ends Sept. 30. For example, fiscal 2015 started Oct. 1, 2014 and ended Sept. 30, 2015. Here are the annual deficits during that period. Fiscal year Federal budget deficit 2010 $1.29 trillion 2011 $1.3 trillion 2012 $1.09 trillion 2013 $680 billion 2014 $483 billion 2015 $439 billion American Action Network told us it picked 2010 as the starting point because at that time, Democrats controlled the Senate and the House (as well as the White House), before Republicans took control of the House in 2011. Spokeswoman Emily Davis told us: "Given Democrats' record and budget plans, does anyone honestly believe that the deficit would be the same today or better without Republicans leading the House?" OK. But Democrats dominated the federal government during the period the group cites: Year Party in the White House Party in control of U.S. Senate Party in control of U.S. House 2010 Democratic Democratic Democratic 2011 Democratic Democratic Republican 2012 Democratic Democratic Republican 2013 Democratic Democratic Republican 2014 Democratic Democratic Republican 2015 Democratic Republican Republican So, it would be difficult to give total credit to the minority party for deficit reductions, which is what American Action Network does. Other factors more important When Obama said in his State of the Union address in January 2015 that the country has seen "our deficits cut by two-thirds," PolitiFact National’s rating was Mostly True. Like American Action Network, Obama was correct with his figures. But his claim was more general, whereas the network specifically credited conservatives for deficit reduction. That not only is problematic in that Republicans had relatively little power compared to Democrats, but because the overall economy has a much bigger impact on deficits than governmental actions such as spending cuts do. Steve Ellis, vice president of the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense, told us Republicans deserve credit for trimming increases in spending that would have been in place had Democrats maintained control of the House. At the same time, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was also approved by the Democratic-controlled Senate and by Obama. Experts also say the deficit has come down in recent years at least as much because of the improving economy, which drives tax revenues up and lessens spending on programs such as food stamps and Medicaid. Economist Alan Auerbach, director of a tax policy and public finance center at the University of California, Berkeley, told us the higher revenues -- especially from individual and corporate income taxes -- had a much bigger impact on deficits than any changes made by the Congress or the president. Obama, of course, and perhaps to a lesser extent GOP leaders in Congress, could claim some, but not all, of the credit for the improved economy. Our rating American Action Network said: "Under conservative leadership, Congress has reduced the federal deficit by 60 percent – nearly $800 billion." The deficit reduction is actually somewhat larger for the period cited by the network, 2010 to 2015. But for most of that period, Republicans controlled only the House. Meanwhile, Democrats controlled the Senate for nearly the entire period, with fellow Democrat Obama in the White House. And the recovering economy, boosting tax revenues, has played a greater role as politicians in bringing deficits down. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression -- our definition of Mostly False.

pomt-02010	"Obama Signs Bill Forgiving All Student Loan Debt."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/09/chain-email/did-barack-obama-sign-bill-forgive-all-outstanding/	Sometimes art mirrors real life so closely that it’s hard to tell the two apart. On June 9, 2014, President Barack Obama made a speech announcing a "presidential memorandum" that allows 5 million federal student loan holders to cap their monthly payments at 10 percent of their income. That announcement followed the introduction of a Senate Democratic bill that would aid borrowers in two ways. The bill would allow students with existing debt to refinance to the interest rate new borrowers can get -- 3.86 percent. The bill also offers an option to refinance private student loans into the federal student-loan system. Right around the same time, debt-laden Americans were noticing chain emails and social media posts with a headline that offered something even bolder -- "Obama Signs Bill Forgiving All Student Loan Debt." A PolitiFact reader was skeptical and asked us to look into it. As is often the case these days, we found that this "news" cluttering up users’ inboxes and feeds was a bit of satire -- or, to those unable to detect much humor in the item, a sly bit of clickbait designed to generate ad revenue. Here’s a portion of the article published in the online publication Empire News (you can read the full article here): "Americans who are under the financial strain of repaying student loan debt may now be off the hook for their education costs. President Obama signed a new federal bill this week releasing any student who has accrued outstanding debt because of the high interest rates and outrageous balances caused by college loans. " ‘Any student, past or present, who has taken loans from the federal government within the last 10 years to pay for higher education, will no longer be required to pay back those loans,’ said President Obama. ‘This forgiveness also is to be extended to any student currently enrolled in college, who may need financial assistance for the next several years as they finish their degrees.’ " If you’re a student with a lot of debt, this sounds great. But it’s too good to be true. The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau estimates that outstanding student loans total roughly $1 trillion. That works out to about one-third of the entire annual federal budget -- an enormous amount that, even if it was phased out over a few years, would lead to even greater deficits, budget cuts or tax increases. Using a back-of-the-envelope calculation, phasing out just one fifth of the student debt total each year for five years -- $200 billion a year -- would mean adding an annual outlay equal to today’s combined budgets for the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Justice, Labor and Transportation. As it turns out, the article was never even intended to be accurate. Empire News has a "disclaimer" page that says, "Empire News is a satirical and entertainment website. We only use invented names in all our stories, except in cases when public figures are being satirized. Any other use of real names is accidental and coincidental." The article’s focus on student loans gains some believability from Obama’s long association with the topic. For instance, during the 2008 presidential campaign, Obama promised to overhaul the government’s relationship with private student lenders and ensure that the maximum Pell Grant award is increased for low-income students. Both of those earned a Promise Kept on our promise tracker, the Obameter. The Senate bill, which Obama has endorsed, would allow existing student-loan borrowers to refinance at lower interest rates, which backers say could "save a typical student $2,000 over the life of his or her loans." The pending measure, sponsored by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., faces a tough road to enactment, even with Obama’s support. Republicans oppose the measure, which Warren wants to pay for with an income tax hike on Americans who earn more than $1 million a year. Our ruling Emails and social media posts are circulating a claim that "Obama Signs Bill Forgiving All Student Loan Debt." But while Obama has taken executive action and called for passage of a student-loan refinancing bill now pending in the Senate, he didn’t say he was planning to forgive all student debts -- a far more massive undertaking. The claim is ridiculously false, so we rate it Pants on Fire.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2014-06-09T16:38:18	2014-06-05	['None']
pomt-05974	"[N]early one in three primary care doctors are forced to limit the number of Medicare patients they see."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/jan/24/tom-price/congressmans-claim-about-medicare-mostly-rings-tru/	Seniors, if you’re struggling to find a doctor that takes Medicare, U.S. Rep. Tom Price has diagnosed your problem. Doctors won’t take patients covered by the federal health insurance program for seniors because Medicare pays them less than what the care actually costs, Price said in a recent op-ed in the Boston Herald. "Already, nearly one in three primary care doctors are forced to limit the number of Medicare patients they see," said Price, who worked as an orthopedic surgeon. We thought the Roswell Republican’s number was worth a closer look. If there is a problem, it could get worse Feb. 29. That’s when Medicare will cut doctor pay by some 27 percent, unless Congress does something about it. Medicare calculates how much it pays doctors according to a special formula set up in 1997 to keep the federal deficit in check. In 2002, that formula gave doctors a pay cut, but physician backlash was so bad that lawmakers have put off reductions ever since. Each time Congress puts off the problem, the cost of fixing it grows. We asked Price spokesman Ryan Murphy for more information on the congressman’s Medicare figure. He said it was confirmed by a May 2010 survey by the American Medical Association, a group that represents doctors’ interests and promotes medicine and public health. The AMA’s online survey of more than 9,000 physicians found that 31 percent of primary care doctors "restrict" the number of Medicare patients in their practice. Some of these doctors don’t accept new Medicare patients, and only treat the ones they already have. Others have stopped treating them at all. Some 83 percent said they did so because Medicare payment rates are too low, the AMA survey said. And 82 percent said they made the move because they were concerned about the threat of future payment cuts. We asked the AMA for the poll’s methodology and found it has a major shortcoming. It wasn’t scientific. Also, the AMA is a powerful lobbying group with its own set of interests. We therefore sought out data from independent sources that took a scientific approach. The data we found was not strictly comparable to the AMA’s, but it did tell us that the findings of the physicians group did not clash with other research. For instance, there’s a 2008 survey by the Center for Studying Health System Change, which provides research used by the federal government and policymakers on both sides of the aisle. The center conducted a nationally representative mail survey of 4,700 physicians. It found that among primary care physicians, 37 percent said they accept some or no new Medicare patients. Of those, more than 56 percent said that inadequate reimbursements were a moderately important or very important reason why. About 48 percent of those who restricted how many Medicare patients they took on said a moderately important or very important reason why was that their practices were already at capacity. There’s also 2009 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which found that some 19 percent of primary care physicians did not accept any new Medicare patients. This number is a lot lower than the AMA’s figure, but it doesn’t mean the doctors group is incorrect. About 10 percent of the CDC’s respondents said they did not know if they accepted new Medicare patients. Also, the data did not specify whether the doctors who accept new ones limit how many they bring on. On its face, the AMA data is not unreasonable. None of the data we reviewed expressly contradicts the finding that 31 percent of primary care doctors "restrict" the number of Medicare patients in their practice. Furthermore, data from the Center for Studying Health System Change appear to support the AMA’s finding. So, is Dr. Price right? Are nearly one in three primary care doctors "forced to limit the number of Medicare patients they see"? The congressman’s number seems sensible, but his language is overheated. It’s not clear that the physicians who drop or restrict Medicare were "forced" to do so because of declining reimbursements or red tape. Nearly half of the primary care physicians responding to the Center for Studying Health System Change survey said one of the reasons they accept so few new Medicare patients is that their practices are full. We recommend Price give his feverish rhetoric an aspirin. And it wouldn’t hurt if he got a second or third opinion on the American Medical Association’s data. Price earns a Mostly True.

pomt-07888	Many of the 9/11 conspirators came from the Muslim Brotherhood, including Osama bin Laden, Ayman Zawahiri and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/04/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-al-qaeda-links-muslim-brotherhood/	As Americans watch the Egyptian uprising from afar, politicians and pundits have speculated about whether the Muslim Brotherhood, an opposition group, will gain power. On his radio show on Jan. 31, Glenn Beck said listeners should know that conspirators of the 9/11 attacks were part of the group. "So the Muslim Brotherhood, they're nothing to worry about," Beck began sarcastically. "Abdullah Azzam and Muhammad Qutb, they taught in Saudi Arabia," Beck said. "…Their star student? Osama bin Laden." "Then, from the Egyptian Brotherhood, you have (Ayman) al-Zawahiri," a prominent leader of al-Qaida, he said. "And another star pupil that has come out of the Muslim Brotherhood? Khalid Sheikh Mohammed," Beck said, referring to the al-Qaida leader described in the 9/11 Commission Report as "the principal architect of the 9/11 attacks." The Muslim Brotherhood, the largest opposition movement in Egypt, seeks to establish an Islamic state governed by sharia or Islamic law. It's true that many al-Qaida members, and 9/11 conspirators specifically, can trace their roots through the Muslim Brotherhood at one time. But the two groups are now bitter rivals. While the Muslim Brotherhood has evolved into a group that says it seeks a gradual and peaceful path to power, al-Qaida has pursued a violent holy war. The Muslim Brotherhood has repeatedly denounced al-Qaida, and vice versa. In an article titled "Don't Fear Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood," Bruce Riedel of the Brookings Institution wrote that "The Egyptian Brotherhood renounced violence years ago, but its relative moderation has made it the target of extreme vilification by more radical Islamists. Al Qaida’s leaders, Osama bin Laden and Ayman Zawahiri, started their political lives affiliated with the Brotherhood but both have denounced it for decades as too soft and a cat’s paw of Mubarak and America." Dan Byman, an expert on the groups at the Brookings Institution, said they have some common goals such as support for a political identity with Islam. But some of the more militant members of the Muslim Brotherhood have moved on to join al-Qaida, believing that the Muslim Brotherhood isn't doing enough, Byman said. The biggest question, Byman said, is whether the Muslim Brotherhood is a barrier to the violent extremism of al-Qaida or whether it is simply a farm team. Byman believes it's probably a little bit of both. Beck is technically correct that many al-Qaida terrorists were once members of the Muslim Brotherhood, said Evan Kohlmann, a terrorism expert who consults for the Department of Justice, "Unfortunately, this analogy is a bit like saying that the Boy Scouts are a paramilitary organization because a certain percentage of them later go on to enlist in the U.S. military." "Here's the deal on the Brotherhood: they aren't exactly in sync with U.S. foreign policy interests, and they do admittedly continue to work with armed groups that have violent aims, like Hamas in Gaza for instance," Kohlman told us via e-mail. "Nonetheless, there is no doubt that the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood is an avowed enemy of Osama Bin Laden, and vice versa. The Brotherhood repeatedly makes that point clear on its own website -- and for its part, al-Qaida has issued numerous audio and video recordings from its senior leadership (including Bin Laden and Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri) accusing the Brotherhood of adopting reviled democratic methods and of 'collaboration with the nation's enemies.'" Now, the specifics on the al-Qaida members. Osama Bin Laden -- According to the book Through Our Enemies' Eyes: Osama bin Laden Radical Islam and the Future of America by Michael Scheuer, bin Laden was heavily influenced by two Muslim Brotherhood leaders -- Abdullah Azzam and Muhammad Qutb -- when he was a student at King Abdul Aziz University in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in the late 1970s. Scheuer writes that bin Laden's "faith was made more assertive" by these scholars. Star pupil? Undetermined, but we'll allow Beck some hyperbole. Ayman al-Zawahiri -- Although many biographies and news articles claim Dr. al-Zawahiri -- often described now as the number two in al-Qaida -- was briefly a member of the Muslim Brotherhood in his early teens, that's a matter of some debate. When Germany's Der Spiegel reported in a July 2, 2007, story "Charting the Rise of the Muslim Brotherhood," that al- Zawahiri "is now considered the textbook example of a member of the Muslim Brotherhood turned terrorist," the Muslim Brotherhood protested. The group issued a public rejection of the claim that al-Zawahiri has ever been affiliated with it. Dr. Mohamed Morsy, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood Executive Bureau, said al-Zawahiri had never been a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and has never conformed to the group's ideology. "The Muslim Brotherhood's ideology shuns violence and the movement has never practiced it," Morsy said. "On the contrary we have been always adopting peaceful means for change." Kohlmann, a terrorism analyst with New York-based security consultancy Flashpoint Global Partners who monitors jihadist websites, pointed to comments al-Zawahiri made in an open online question-and-answer session hosted by several al-Qaida-affiliated websites in 2008. According to al-Zawahiri, "the freedom which the Brotherhood and other groups enjoy these days is only due to the military activities... But, instead of thanking the mujihadeen -- or at least not speaking ill of them--they have presented themselves as a mutually-agreeable alternative to America and its agents, to insult and to defame the mujahideen...They should make an effort to improve the image of their organization after all the miserable situations in which they have become entangled -- much as pledging allegiance to Hosni Mubarak and their silence while their brothers entered Kabul and Baghdad on the backs of Christian tanks." Al-Zawahiri also repeatedly and pointedly criticized the Muslim Brotherhood in his book, The Bitter Harvest. And in addition to the Muslim Brotherhood roundly denying that al-Zawahiri was ever a member, al-Zawahiri himself has "vigorously and indignantly contested allegations that he was ever affiliated with the Brotherhood in Egypt," Kohlmann said. "So the idea that Zawahiri has anything to do with the Brotherhood is pretty much a total canard." Khalid Sheikh Mohammed -- For him, we refer to the 9/11 Commission Report, page 145, which states, "Raised in a religious family, KSM claims to have joined the Muslim Brotherhood at age 16 and to have become enamored of violent jihad at youth camps in the desert." So Beck is right that many 9/11 conspirators have come out of, or once ascribed to the teachings of, the Muslim Brotherhood -- including Osama bin Laden and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed for sure, while the case for al-Zawahiri is less clear. But Beck's comments ignore the sharply different approaches of the two groups. Each has disavowed the other, and each has charted a different path to power (at least publicly). "The real question -- what the Brotherhood is -- is very much an open question," Byman said. "In Egypt, in a way, we don't know. It's hard to know what part of its rhetoric to believe." But by failing to even mention the divide between the Muslim Brotherhood and al-Qaida, Beck has left out key context in his history lesson, and so we rate his statement Half True.

pomt-05307	On gun policy	half flip	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/18/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-exhibits-marked-change-gun-rhetoric/	Mitt Romney has at times had an awkward relationship with firearms, as when he said during the 2008 Republican presidential primary that his hunting experience generally involved "small varmints." But has he flip-flopped on gun policy? We’ll start by noting that the Flip-O-Meter rates politicians' consistency on particular topics from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on their decisions to change their minds. It’s simply gauging whether they did. Romney’s statements on gun restrictions before he became governor In 1994, Romney challenged Democratic Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and lost. In 2002, he ran successfully for governor of Massachusetts. During his campaign against Kennedy, Romney supported two gun control measures -- the Brady Bill, which required background checks for gun purchases, and a ban on certain types of assault weapons. Both were strongly opposed by most gun-rights advocates. In a July 1994 question-and-answer session with voters arranged by the Boston Herald, Romney "reaffirmed" his support for both measures. "I don't think (the waiting period) will have a massive effect on crime, but I think it will have a positive effect," Romney said. In a subsequent interview published on Sept. 23, 1994, Romney said, "I don't want special-interest groups making this their campaign. I don't want their money. I don't want their help. This is my race." In the interview, Romney specifically mentioned gun-rights advocates, acknowledging that his stands on the two gun-control measures would put him at odds with such groups. "That's not going to make me the hero of the NRA," he said, referring to the National Rifle Association. "I don't line up with a lot of special interest groups." Then, in his 2002 race for governor, Romney said during a debate against against Democrat Shannon O'Brien, "We have tough gun laws in Massachusetts; I support them." In both cases, Romney expressed views favorable to certain kinds of gun-control laws. This is not too surprising, since he was running for statewide office in Massachusetts, which tends to be more favorable toward those laws than more rural parts of the country. Romney’s views on an assault-weapons ban as governor In 2004, in the middle of his single four-year term as governor, Romney signed a permanent ban on assault weapons -- reportedly the first such state law in the country. "These guns are not made for recreation or self-defense," the Globe quoted Romney as saying. "They are instruments of destruction with the sole purpose of hunting down and killing people." Despite that provision -- usually a deal-breaker for gun-rights groups -- the measure received support from pro-gun groups because other provisions lengthened the terms of firearm ID cards and licenses to carry firearms. The Globe reported that during the 2008 campaign, Romney described the bill as a "consensus measure" and a "positive step." Not long after Romney signed the bill, Romney appeared on the Aug. 4, 2004, edition of the Fox News program Hannity and Colmes. Guest co-host Pat Halpin asked Romney about the existing federal assault weapons ban, which was then on a path to expiring due to intentional Republican inaction. "So are you in favor of that ban being extended or do you want to see it lapse?" Romney responded, "I believe the people should have the right to bear arms, but I don't believe that we have to have assault weapons as part of our personal arsenal. … In my state I just signed a piece of legislation extending the ban on certain assault weapons in our state." Halpin continued to prod. "Governor, would you like to see that extended again on the federal level, as well?" she asked. Romney replied, "It very well may be. In our state what we did is we got both sides of this issue to come together, because we relaxed a number of things, allowing people who hadn't been able to get weapons in the past to be able to purchase those. … There are hunters in the NRA and the gun owners' action league (who) backed the legislation that said, ‘Look, let's protect our citizens from dangerous assault weapons, but let's also make … regular weapons more available to our citizens.’ And we made a compromise that works." Romney, at that moment, appears to be straddling the issue, arguing that ordinary Americans have the right to bear some types of arms but not assault weapons. He said it "very well may be necessary" to extend the federal assault-weapons ban, while adding that he acted on the state ban because it was a compromise that included expansions of other types of gun ownership rules. Romney’s statements during the 2008 presidential campaign Romney’s rhetoric on gun control began to shift as he made his first bid for the White House in 2008. • Addressing a National Rifle Association members by video on Sept. 10, 2007, Romney said, "I support the Second Amendment as one of the most basic and fundamental rights of every American. It's essential to our functioning as a free society, as are all the liberties enumerated in the Bill of Rights." He repeated that message later that month at a meeting of the National Shooting Sports Foundation. • On the Oct. 21, 2007, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation, host Bob Schieffer challenged Romney on the evolution of his gun-control position. Schieffer said, "You once said, ‘We do have tough gun laws in Massachusetts, I support them, I won't chip away at them. I believe they protect us.’ Now you say you are a gun owner. You have joined the National Rifle Association, after saying at one point, ‘I don't line up with the National Rifle Association.’ Why would you join that group?" Romney responded, "I support the NRA. I support Second Amendment rights, but I don't line up 100 percent with the NRA. They take some positions that are different than mine. But my positions are the same as my positions have been with regards to guns for a long, long time, and that is that I respect the right of people to bear arms, and whether that's for hunting or personal protection. ..." • During a Republican presidential debate on Jan. 24, 2008, in Boca Raton, Fla., fellow Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee challenged Romney on his views about gun control. Romney responded, "I do support the Second Amendment. And I believe that this is an individual right of citizens and not a right of government. And I hope the Supreme Court reaches that same conclusion." He continued, "I also, like the president, would have signed the assault weapon ban that came to his desk. I said I would have supported that and signed a similar bill in our state. It was a bill worked out, by the way, between pro-gun lobby and anti-gun lobby individuals. Both sides of the issue came together and found a way to provide relaxation in licensing requirements and allow more people to have guns for their own legal purposes. And so we signed that in Massachusetts, and I said I would support that at the federal level, just as the president said he would. It did not pass at the federal level. I do not believe we need new legislation. "I do not support any new legislation of an assault weapon ban nature, including that against semiautomatic weapons. I instead believe that we have laws in place that if they're implemented and enforced, will provide the protection and the safety of the American people. But I do not support any new legislation, and I do support the right of individuals to bear arms, whether for hunting purposes or for protection purposes or any other reason. That's the right that people have." • In a candidate questionnaire during the 2008 primary campaign, the Washington Post asked Romney, "Do you think tighter restrictions should be in place for those buying a firearm?" Romney answered, "No. I believe we need to focus on enforcing our current laws rather than creating new laws that burden lawful gun owners. ... I do not believe in a one-size-fits-all federal approach to gun ownership because people keep and use firearms for different reasons. ..." Collectively, Romney’s comments from the 2008 campaign suggest that he heightened his rhetorical support for gun rights, while maintaining some distance from NRA orthodoxy. On actual policies, though, Romney doesn’t appear to have changed his position. Romney’s statements during the 2012 presidential campaign Whatever lingering tolerance Romney expressed for gun control in 2008 disappeared in the heat of a contentious 2012 Republican primary. The issues section of Romney’s website offers a clear endorsement of gun rights: "The Second Amendment is essential to the functioning of our free society. Mitt strongly supports the right of all law-abiding Americans to exercise their constitutionally protected right to own firearms and to use them for lawful purposes, including hunting, recreational shooting, self-defense, and the protection of family and property. Like the majority of Americans, Mitt does not believe that the United States needs additional laws that restrict the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms." The website even touts the bill Romney signed as governor but ignores the assault-weapons portion. "As governor of Massachusetts, Mitt was proud to support legislation that expanded the rights of gun owners. He worked hard to advance the ability of law-abiding citizens to purchase and own firearms, while opposing liberal desires to create bureaucracy intended to burden gun owners and sportsmen." Romney offered a similar message in an address to the national convention of the NRA in St. Louis on April 13, 2012: "We need a president who will enforce current laws, not create new ones that only serve to burden lawful gun owners. President Obama has not; I will. We need a president who will stand up for the rights of hunters, sportsmen, and those seeking to protect their homes and their families. President Obama has not; I will. And if we are going to safeguard our Second Amendment, it is time to elect a president who will defend the rights President Obama ignores or minimizes. I will." Our ruling During his campaigns for statewide Massachusetts office, Romney openly spoke of his support for -- to use his words from 2002 -- "tough gun laws." As recently as the 2008 Republican primary, Romney said "I don't line up 100 percent with the NRA." But since then, his pro-gun rhetoric has become sharper and virtually all nuance was erased. He even touted the bill he signed in Massachusetts by scrubbing any reference to the provisions banning assault weapons. Still, while Romney’s rhetoric has moved distinctly in the NRA’s direction, it’s not clear that his policy positions have changed. This is partly because Romney, even in the 1994 campaign didn’t take a full-blown, pro-gun-control stand. And even now, as his rhetoric has become more pro-gun, Romney has never gone so far as to specifically renounce his prior positions, such as his signing of the 2004 Massachusetts law, which at the time was billed as a compromise measure.

pomt-09452	Texas is the "fastest growing state" with the "most Fortune 500 companies."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/mar/07/rick-perry/perry-says-texas-fastest-growing-state-most-fortun/	After Gov. Rick Perry won the 2010 Republican nomination for governor Tuesday, he thanked voters in a cinematic Web video posted on his campaign site. The "Leader" video, set to rock music, shows stampeding horses, standing ovations and a glamour shot of Perry. More than 20 proclaimed accomplishments flash by on the screen including two claims PolitiFact Texas hadn't previously checked — that Texas has the "most Fortune 500 companies" and that it's the "fastest-growing state." Superlative claims often draw our attention; sometimes they stretch the truth. We decided to look first at whether Texas is home to the most Fortune 500 companies. Every year, Fortune magazine ranks the top 500 U.S. companies by revenue. In 2009, Texas was home to the most companies in the compilation, topped by Exxon Mobil, which had more than $442 billion, and also including behemoths such as ConocoPhillips, AT&T and Valero Energy. In 2009, Texas was the hostess with the mostest, with 64 Fortune 500 companies; Texas also topped the list in 2006 and 2008. New York and California were home to 56 and 51 companies, respectively, in 2009. And how about Texas being touted as the fastest-growing state in the United States? Perry's campaign pointed us to population data from the U.S. Census Bureau, which reported in December that Texas gained more residents than any other state between July 2008 and July 2009, when the bureau issued its last population estimates in advance of the 2010 census. That's 478,012 additional people — no small potatoes. California had the next highest number: 381,293. Still, doesn't it stand to reason that a state that already has the second-biggest population — Texas — will tend to add more people than less populous states? Does that really mean the state is growing faster than all others? Not exactly. Robert Bernstein, a public information officer at the Census Bureau, said: "The term 'fastest-growing' is somewhat subjective. When we (at the bureau) say 'fastest-growing,' we usually mean highest rate of growth." In the July-to-July period, Wyoming and Utah had the highest rate of growth at about 2.1 percent each. Texas wasn't far behind at 2 percent, followed by Colorado, with a 1.8 percent bump in population. Bernstein said: "You might want to say Texas had the highest numerical growth in the country, rather than (it) was the fastest-growing state." Of course, Perry's fastest-growing-state statement makes for a sharper sound bite. But it fuzzes the fact that two Western states grew a little faster in the same time period. And when we looked at year-to-year growth covering previous years, other states also outpaced Texas. For instance, from July 2007 to July 2008, Texas similarly added the most new residents. But its rate of population growth trailed both Utah and Arizona. From 2006 to 2007, Texas had the seventh-highest rate of growth of the states. Where does that leave us? In 2009, Texas was home to the most Fortune 500 companies. And it gained more people than any other state from July 2008 to July 2009. But raw numbers don't tell the whole story. Comparative growth is best measured by the rate at which it occurs. By that measure, Wyoming and Utah grew faster than Texas from July 2008 to July 2009. Texas was outpaced by other states during each of the two immediately preceding year-to-year periods as well. We rate Perry's combined claims as Half True.

pomt-10615	"And he's the only candidate who will fight for a national catastrophe fund to reduce insurance rates."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/18/rudy-giuliani/strong-supporter-yes-the-only-fan-no/	In a television advertisement aimed directly at Florida voters, Rudy Giuliani tried to differentiate himself from the crowded Republican field. "And he's the only candidate who will fight for a national catastrophe fund to reduce insurance rates," says an announcer during the spot, which debuted Jan. 16, 2008. The topic is a right of passage for presidential hopefuls who visit Florida because it's an issue on the minds of many homeowners hit with rising insurance costs. It's also a political calculation: A major proponent of the fund is Republican Gov. Charlie Crist, a much-sought endorsement. It's true, Giuliani is a strong supporter — the strongest in the GOP field. But other candidates have also expressed support, or at least an open mind. Giuliani aside, the other Republican candidates want to see the fine print first. On a spectrum — from supportive to skeptical — this is how they appear to fall: Giuliani, John McCain, Mitt Romney, Mike Huckabee, Fred Thompson. Ron Paul and Duncan Hunter go unranked because they haven't spoken about it. Florida political reporters have asked this question to just about every candidate. For your consideration, below are their full statements to the question of whether they support a national catastrophe fund: • Giuliani, at a speech to Florida lawmakers in Tallahassee in April 2007: "... I think it is a very good idea. I think it's a very good idea not just for Florida, it's a very good idea for the whole country. We all need it. You need it for hurricanes, California needs it for earthquakes, somebody else needs it for tornadoes. New York needs it for ice storms and for hurricanes. ... The parts of the country that think it only helps Florida, I think are missing all the other natural catastrophes and disasters and maybe they are not hurricanes, but they are all the other things I mentioned." • McCain, during a September 2007 interview with the St. Petersburg Times: "If people are going to build homes where hurricanes hit, they have to assume a great part of that liability. We don't have that many hurricanes that hit Arizona, as you know. We need to all work together and see if the present unacceptable situation can be remedied, and if that requires some federal action, I'm for it — but not just insuring anybody for any circumstance. I'm not going to do that. I would not support such a thing." • Romney from a town hall forum in Orange Park in September 2007: " ... I would devote energy and time to understanding why it is that the private insurers are not providing insurance to people who live along the coastline or in hazardous areas. If we need federal support of some kind, that's something I'm open to. But I certainly want to talk to the insurers to understand: do they have capital sufficient for this responsibility; if not, why not? What role could the government play? But I'm not going to at this stage give a final answer to that. It's something that I would make a priority in my administration: to identify the needs of homeowners in places which are high-risk areas." • Huckabee, during a May 2007 interview with the Times: He said he was receptive but rebuilding people's beach homes doesn't appeal to him. Still, he said, "I come from a state that's prone to tornadoes and floods. I understand how devastating it can be, so I'm very sympathetic." • Thompson during an September 2007 interview with the Times: "No, I don't know enough about it yet. I know that it's an issue, I know that it's being talked about. That's one of the things I want to talk to people about while I'm down here, make sure I understand what's being proposed. But I'll give it serious consideration ..." (Campaign spokesman Jeff Sadosky added in a Jan. 16, 2008, interview that Thompson believes a fund "is something worth looking at" but he also wants to explore the idea of a "regional compact.") • Paul, the congressman from Texas, hasn't commented directly on the issue. • Duncan Hunter, the congressman from California, has not commented on the issue directly. So when an announcer says Giuliani is "the only candidate who will fight for" a national fund, he has a case. He pledges to be a strong advocate, unlike the other candidates. But some others in the field are open to a federal role in securing homeowner insurance in high-risk areas, so we rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-12792	Says Donald Trump was "caught investing in (the) Dakota Pipeline before signing it."	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/feb/16/learnprogressorg/trump-caught-investing-dakota-access-pipeline-appr/	A left-leaning blog asserts that President Donald Trump was busted for approving the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline for financial gain, but the facts of the case ended up being buried. "Breaking: Trump caught investing in Dakota Pipeline before signing it," read the headline on an undated post on LearnProgress.org. The blog regularly posts items lambasting Trump and his policies. Facebook flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of its efforts to weed out fake news in its users’ feeds. Most instances of the story being shared on Facebook are on Feb. 8, 2017. The website did not answer our request to confirm the date. But the implication that Trump approved the pipeline in order to profit from its construction doesn’t hold up to scrutiny. In the post, LearnProgress.org cited a Nov. 26, 2016, Associated Press report that showed Trump owned shares in two companies involved in the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, a 1,168-mile crude oil pipeline that runs from North Dakota to Illinois. Environmentalists and Native American tribes have opposed the route of the pipeline, and in December then-President Barack Obama blocked completion of the project. The AP story pointed out that Trump owned between $15,000 and $50,000 in stock for a Texas company called Energy Transfer Partners. He had between $500,000 and $1 million the year before that. He also owned between $100,000 and $250,000 in stock in energy company Phillips 66, which the AP says has a one-quarter share of the pipeline. This was considered a potential conflict of interest for the future president, but to say he was "caught" is out of bounds. He listed the information on May 2016 federal disclosure forms. Much has been made of Trump’s stock in the companies. The issue was reported on widely, as was the fact that he said he sold the shares of pipeline parent company Energy Transfer Partners in the summer of 2016. The White House has not confirmed whether he still owns the Phillips 66 shares, so that does remain a question mark. A Trump spokesman we contacted did not answer our questions about those shares. In any event, the headline suggests that Trump dumped a bunch of money into the pipeline and then approved its construction, ostensibly to make a big profit from it. The timeline doesn’t support that. Trump said in December 2016, before his inauguration, that he would restart pipeline construction. He didn’t have any actual power to do so until Jan. 20, 2017, well after he sold his Energy Transfer Partners stock. He did sign an executive action on Jan. 24 to get the pipeline moving again. Construction resumed on Feb. 9, and the Standing Rock Sioux tribe challenged the pipeline in court on Feb. 14. The headline’s assertion that Trump was caught in some kind of wrongdoing by investing in the pipeline before approving it is wrong and misleading. The potential conflict of interest was known and at least partially addressed before Trump became president and restarted the project. We rate the headline False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e31293f2-6a2f-4526-ba69-4a03895ea482	None	LearnProgress.org	None	None	None	2017-02-16T16:42:59	2017-02-08	['None']
pomt-09503	"Mayor White has major stake in Barnett Shale production company."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/feb/22/farouk-shami/shami-says-white-has-major-stake-barnett-shale-dri/	Gubernatorial hopeful Bill White doesn’t shy away from energy issues — after all, he was mayor of Houston, a city that many oil and gas companies call home, and was deputy energy secretary for about two years during the Clinton administration. More unusual by Houston — and Texas — standards, White touts initiatives undertaken during his six years as mayor to reduce the amount of toxic chemicals emitted by Houston's petrochemical industries. But now Farouk Shami, White's leading Democratic opponent, is trying to use an energy issue against the former mayor, touching on concerns among residents and officials about the environmental and health effects of drilling in populated areas of the Barnett Shale, a natural gas field that stretches west and south from Dallas and covers more than 20 counties. Shami released a statement Feb. 9 with this headline: "Mayor White Has Major Stake in Barnett Shale Production Company." In it, Shami concluded that "it's a conflict of interest at best and utter hypocrisy at worst." First things first. Is White really connected to a company drilling for natural gas in the Barnett Shale? Shami’s statement links White to the drilling through the former mayor’s ownership of stock in Exxon Mobil Corp., based in Irving. The oil giant is in the process of buying Fort Worth-based XTO Energy Inc., one of the leading producers of gas in the Barnett Shale. XTO says on its Web site that the area accounts for more than 20 percent of its total oil and natural gas production, and it has plans to expand its drilling there. Shami's press release says White "has at least $2.2 million invested in oil and gas stocks, with a substantial position in the giant Exxon Mobile" (sic). Asked how it calculated the size of White's investment, Shami's campaign provided a chart based on a federal financial disclosure form White filed in May 2009 when he was a candidate for the U.S. Senate. The campaign counted 14 energy companies in White’s portfolio during 2008, including Exxon and ConocoPhillips. Then it added up the reported values of White’s energy stock holdings. Therein lies a problem. Instead of exact dollar amounts, the disclosure form lists a range of values for each stock, and some are pretty wide. For example, the reported value of White’s investment in BJ Services Co., an oil and gas services company on whose board he sits, is between $500,001 and $1 million – a difference of a half-million dollars. Totaling the high numbers yields $2.2 million; using the low numbers, $1 million. In text with the chart, the Shami campaign used different language from the press release, which states that White has "at least $2.2 million" invested in oil and gas companies. The chart wording states White has "as much as" that amount. A more definitive measure of White's holdings came from his campaign, which said his oil and gas stocks were worth $1.1 million to $1.3 million in 2009. They are in several accounts personally managed by White and account for about 25 percent of his total portfolio. The White campaign said the candidate has owned Exxon stock for more than five years and disclosed to us the number (700) and value (about $45,000) of the shares. Since Exxon is valued at about $310 billion, White owns far less than 1 percent — a figure that Katy Bacon, a spokeswoman for the White campaign, suggested does not constitute the "substantial position" in Exxon that Shami claims. Besides, Exxon’s $31 billion purchase of XTO, announced in December, is still pending, subject to approval by XTO stockholders and the Federal Trade Commission. That means that as of right now, owning stock in Exxon does not equal owning stock in XTO. However, we discovered White does have an interest in Barnett Shale drilling through another company in his portfolio. According to the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the exploration and production of oil and natural gas, ConocoPhillips — in which White reported owning stock valued between $100,001 and $250,000 in 2008 — is currently active in the Barnett Shale through a subsidiary, Burlington Resources. So much for assessing White's stake in the Barnett Shale. A more problematic issue is whether the investments constitute a conflict of interest, as Shami claims. During the debate, both Shami and a reporter asked White whether he supported a proposed moratorium on new drilling in the Barnett Shale. White said he did not, arguing that emissions and other violations should be addressed on a case-by-case basis. "I think it would be unfair to shut down operations of all operators based on what some operators do," he said. In the news release, Shami, who is in favor of a moratorium, says that "it’s disturbing to think Mayor White’s conflict of interest could be putting people’s lives at risk." Brian Roberts, a professor of government at the University of Texas, said the ethical concerns raised by Shami are speculative and could become an issue only if White, as governor, were to participate in decisions related to oil and gas. But Roberts said the regulation of those industries largely belongs to the Railroad Commission, whose members are elected. Putting aside the conflict issue, where does this leave us? Shami is correct that White has a financial interest in Exxon, as well as other oil and gas companies. And it's true that Exxon is acquiring XTO, a $27 billion company that's a big player in the Barnett Shale. But Shami's assertion that White's $45,000 investment in Exxon constitutes a "major stake" in XTO is off the mark. Though we found that White has a larger interest in ConocoPhillips, which owns another company drilling in the Barnett Shale, that too is a tiny piece of a multinational oil company's action. We rate Shami's statement as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00285	"Joe Manchin has a ‘D' rating from the NRA."	mostly true	/west-virginia/statements/2018/sep/28/patrick-morrisey/does-joe-manchin-have-d-rating-national-rifle-asso/	Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate seeking to oust U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., is attacking Manchin for not being a big enough advocate for gun rights. In the Sept. 7 tweet, Morrisey said, "Joe Manchin has a "D" rating from the NRA, and fought alongside Obama and Schumer for anti-gun legislation." The NRA is the National Rifle Association, the nation’s largest gun-rights group, while Obama is former President Barack Obama and Schumer is Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Here, we’ll focus on the NRA rating for Manchin. In a news release, the NRA said Manchin has earned a D rating from the group this year. In the same news release, the group said it was endorsing Morrisey and airing ads on his behalf in the Charleston and Bluefield markets. "Contrary to what Joe Manchin says in West Virginia, he has supported the agenda of Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer by voting in favor of gun control in Washington, D.C.," said Chris Cox, chairman of the NRA Political Victory Fund. So it’s clear that the NRA has given Manchin a D rating this year. But the group hasn’t always been so negative about Manchin -- something the ad glosses over. In 2004, when Manchin was running for governor, he received an "A+" rating from the NRA and received the group’s endorsement when running for governor. And in 2010 and 2012, when Manchin was running for a U.S. Senate seat, he was endorsed by the NRA and received an "A" rating. "Joe Manchin is committed to protecting the Right to Keep and Bear Arms guaranteed to all Americans," Cox wrote in 2012. Manchin’s relations with the NRA soured in 2013 after he and Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., proposed legislation that would have enacted tighter background checks for certain gun purchases. The NRA Political Victory Fund website doesn’t allow for searches of past ratings, although it once did, the Washington Post reported in June 2018. Asked by the Post for the rationale for removing past grades, Jennifer Baker, an NRA spokeswoman, said, "I don’t understand — why are you asking? What does it matter to you? The grades are not relevant after the election." Our ruling Morrisey tweeted that "Joe Manchin has a ‘D’ rating from the NRA." That’s certainly the case for 2018, and the NRA has endorsed Morrisey over Manchin this year. But this ignores that in previous campaigns, Manchin received ‘A’ and ‘A+’ ratings from the NRA and won the group’s endorsement those years. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Patrick Morrisey	None	None	None	2018-09-28T09:38:02	2018-09-07	['None']

pomt-05381	Each U.S. House member who voted to overhaul Social Security in 1983 was re-elected.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/may/08/saxby-chambliss/senator-praises-reagan-era-social-security-push-bi/	U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, bemoaning the lack of bipartisanship in Congress, recently told a story to emphasize the benefits of Democrats and Republicans working together. The Georgia Republican went back to the early 1980s to make his case, saying today’s Congress should take a similar approach of rising above politics to address major fiscal challenges such as the increasing costs of Medicaid and Medicare. "What I always found is if you look back at [former Republican President] Ronald Reagan and [former Democratic House Speaker] Tip O’Neill, they raised the Social Security age, made some significant changes back there," Chambliss said last month at the Atlanta Press Club. "Boy, everybody thought that’s the political end of that Congress. Every single member of the House of Representatives who voted for that change got re-elected because they did the right thing. I just think if you do the right thing, the political side of things will take care of itself." PolitiFact Georgia was there for the senator’s speech and the question-and-answer session, where he made this particular claim. We wanted to find out whether Chambliss was right or was this a political tall tale. Chambliss is a member of the Senate’s "Gang of Six," a group of three Republicans and three Democrats that has tried to come up with federal budget solutions. The senator has taken much criticism for his participation in the effort, primarily from fiscal conservatives for his position on some ideas to reduce the nation’s multitrillion-dollar debt. Senate leadership, Chambliss said, hasn’t taken kindly to the group’s work because of -- surprise! -- politics. The "hard, tough votes" on some of these issues might hurt the future ambitions of some senators, Chambliss said. Reagan, considered by some as the father of modern conservative politics, was no fan of the Social Security system, which he saw as government run amok. When Reagan took office in 1981, federal economists warned that the system was in financial peril because of the steadily increasing number of senior citizens eligible for benefits and projections that more Americans would become future recipients. The president tried to overhaul the system. Reagan’s first plan got not one vote in the Senate, and the Democratic-led House voted against it as well. Reagan then created a bipartisan commission led by future Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to come up with solutions to keep Social Security solvent. O’Neill, a liberal from Massachusetts, appointed some members to the commission. The eventual compromise included increases in Social Security tax rates, increased benefits for disabled widows and, most importantly, a gradual increase in the eligibility age to 67 by the year 2027. The Social Security Administration’s website has a list of how each member of Congress voted on the changes in March 1983. Overwhelming majorities of House and Senate members across party lines voted in favor of the changes. But did each member who voted "Aye" on the legislation get re-elected the following year, as Chambliss said? No, according to a tally by the federal government of 1984 congressional election results. Ten House members lost in 1984 despite voting to pass the Social Security overhaul. The list included Elliott Levitas, a DeKalb County Democrat who lost to Republican Pat Swindall. Levitas, now a senior counsel in the Atlanta offices of the law firm Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton, said he pushed for Social Security reform and recalled voting in favor of changes to maintain the system’s viability. He said it wasn’t a factor in his 1984 defeat. Reagan was. The president was re-elected in historic fashion that year (Reagan won 49 of 50 states) and had strong coattails that analysts say helped many Republicans win congressional contests in 1984. "[The Democratic ticket] was not wildly popular in this area, and Reagan was," Levitas said. In fact, all 10 House members who voted in favor of the Social Security overhaul and lost their re-election bids were Democrats. Chambliss press secretary Lauren Claffey noted that when we asked her office about the veracity of her boss’ claim. She said the senator was close; about 95 percent of the 243 House members who voted for the overhaul were re-elected. "Although not every single member that voted for Social Security reform was re-elected, it is safe to say that an overwhelming majority of those who voted for the reform were, and supports the point that Sen. Chambliss was making that ‘if you do the right thing, then the political side of it will take care of itself,’ " Claffey said via email. This was a tough call for PolitiFact Georgia. Chambliss wasn’t precisely correct when he said "every single member" of the House who voted for the overhaul was re-elected. But his overall point was correct -- most lawmakers who voted for changes to Social Security were re-elected. Nearly all of them. Our rating: Half True.

pomt-10475	If the U.S. stops adding to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, it "will lessen worldwide demand for oil" and reduce prices.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/16/john-mccain/not-enough-to-matter/	If only it were that easy. With gas prices above $3 per gallon and voters complaining that energy prices are squeezing them from every direction, Sen. John McCain, the de facto Republican nominee for president, is offering a salve based on Economics 101, the rule of supply and demand: If elected, he'll stop filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to reduce demand and ease prices. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve, or SPR, is the nation's government-owned stockpile of crude oil. It is stored in a series of salt caverns in Texas and Louisiana and currently holds about 700-million barrels of oil, enough to replace the nation's oil imports for about 60 days. President Bush supports expanding the reserve to 1-billion barrels in the next decade. "Right now I think we should stop adding to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve," McCain said at a small business roundtable in Brooklyn, N.Y., on April 10. "The SPR is intended to offset the impact of physical disruption of oil supplies. "But with oil at over $100 a barrel and an adequate supply in the SPR, it is time to suspend purchases. This will lessen worldwide demand for oil, and if the classic laws of supply and demand hold, we should see a welcome decrease in the price of oil." Well, kind of. The problem is, the SPR doesn't buy enough oil to make a significant dent in oil supplies or prices, experts say. The Energy Information Administration, the independent, analytical arm of the U.S. Energy Department, estimates that the SPR adds, at most, $1 to $2 to the cost of a $100 barrel of oil, or as much as 4 cents to 5 cents per gallon of refined gasoline. Independent experts tend to agree. While any cut in prices may be better than nothing, it's hard to argue those pennies would equal the "welcome decrease" McCain describes with gas prices up around $3.30 per gallon. "Our analysis points out that there is a relatively minor impact, maybe a dollar or two at most per barrel, out of $100-plus per barrel," said Doug McIntyre, a senior oil market analyst at the Energy Information Administration in Washington. "I'm sure everyone would love to find something they could change and immediately make prices drop $20 a barrel, regardless of the (political) party. Our analysis is, this isn't the magic bullet that some would like it to be." Congress created the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in response to the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo to protect the economy in case of another disruption to oil imports. It has steadily expanded over the years, and was growing by as much as 300,000 barrels per day during the Reagan administration. The government currently adds to the reserve by about 70,000 barrels of crude oil per day, less than one-half of 1 percent of the 20.6-million barrels the United States uses daily. So while it does increase demand, it does so by a relatively small amount. Dr. A.F. Alhajji, an associate professor of economics at Ohio Northern University and an international expert on oil markets, said filling the SPR does add to costs, in part because the government creates inefficiencies in the way it fills it. "If you do the calculations, it has an impact," Alhajji said. But, he added, McCain's idea "would have a small impact. ... In an environment of increasing oil prices, people are not going to feel it, people are not going to see it." Not everyone agrees. A 2003 report by the Democratic staff of a subcommittee of the Senate Government Affairs Committee, led by Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., found that filling the SPR could have "significant market impact" because the balance between global supply and global demand is generally only several hundred thousand barrels of oil. In that context, sending 100,000 barrels a day to the SPR could affect demand, the report argued. But U.S. refineries have more oil at their disposal than they are processing right now, so making more available would not necessarily put more gasoline into the market and cut costs. Plus, McIntyre said the government's purchase schedule is well known, "so the market should be able to account for it fairly easily." The oil market also is complex. It is influenced by a variety of factors, including current demand, expected demand, available stockpiles and, of course, global and domestic politics. That makes it difficult to determine exactly how gas prices would truly be affected if the government stopped adding to the reserve, but experts doubt it would be significant. A Congressional Research Service report from 2005 also was skeptical. "The effect of any change in fill policy on gasoline prices would depend on a number of factors — refiners' access to SPR crude, available refining capacity to manufacture gasoline meeting regional Clean Air requirements, other local conditions, and weekly reports of gasoline and other product stocks," the report said. "While prices might fall some on the heels of an announcement that SPR fill would be deferred, the adjustment might be only short-term. Gasoline and home heating oil prices might be more sensitive to reported stock levels than to reports of modest additional crude supply." Also, only about 40 percent of the cost of a gallon of gasoline comes from the price of crude oil, so a drop (or rise) in oil prices and doesn't necessarily mean a corresponding drop (or rise) in gas prices. The reserve has been tapped in the form of sales, exchanges or loans several times over the years, including after Hurricane Katrina disrupted oil production and imports on the Gulf Coast in 2005 and after Hurricane Ivan struck the Gulf Coast in 2004. In 1996, sales from the reserve were used to raise money. In April 1996, President Clinton released 12-million barrels to blunt a rise in crude oil prices. Filling the reserve also was suspended after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, and again in 1994 to save money. We find that while McCain is correct in principle, he grossly overstates the potential impact of his idea. Drivers would see little change in the price at the pump if the government stopped buying oil for the Strategic Reserve. We rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11521	"Trump declares globalist Soros as ‘national security threat’ using Obama’s 2014 executive order."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/feb/19/conservative-daily-post/no-trump-did-not-declare-george-soros-security-thr/	A hoax circulating on the Internet claims that President Donald Trump had enough with billionaire liberal George Soros and contacted Russia for a file on him. "Trump declares globalist Soros as ‘national security threat’ using Obama’s 2014 executive order," stated a Jan. 30 headline on the Conservative Daily Post. There is no evidence that Trump took any such action against Soros. The same story has been picked up by multiple websites. The Hungarian-born Soros is a hedge fund manager who has supported liberal causes and backed Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Soros has been a major critic of Trump. After Trump won, Soros called him "a con artist and would-be dictator." At a speech in Davos, Switzerland, in January, Soros said, "I consider the Trump administration a danger to the world." Soros has been the target of many online hoaxes, including that his foundations were banned from Austria and false smears, for example that he instigated racial protests in Charlottesville. Soros, who is Jewish, has also been falsely accused of being a Nazi collaborator. In this case, the story said Trump had placed a call to Russia to ask about files related to Soros. The story said Trump used a 2014 executive order by Obama to take such action. That executive order was real, stating that Obama declared a national emergency to deal with the threat of people undermining democracy in Ukraine. However, there is no evidence that Trump used that order to label Soros a threat to national security. Soros has been involved in Ukraine for decades and said he established a foundation there before it declared independence from the Russia. His International Renaissance Foundation has invested tens of millions in "Ukrainian NGOs, sponsored conferences, scholarships, human-rights confabs and investigative journalists," the National Post reported in 2015. In 2015, Soros called on the west to inject $50 billion in Ukraine. Adrian Karatnycky, an expert on Ukraine and nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, which promotes engagement in international affairs, said in general Soros is viewed as a positive figure in Ukraine. "He is not overtly in step with a particular political party and political movement," he said. "His foundation is pretty sober-minded, reasonably well regarded in Ukraine." We emailed the Conservative Daily Post and did not get a reply. The Las Vegas-based website states that it "thrives on independent journalism and truth;" however, the story about Soros is not based in evidence. We found no proof that Trump declared Obama a "national security threat." We rate this story Pants on Fire.

pomt-09926	"Why do we have automatic citizenship upon birth? We're the only country in the world that has it."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/19/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-claims-us-only-country-automatic-citize/	On his June 10, 2009, Fox News program, host Glenn Beck raised an immigration hot button that has gained some legislative traction in recent months: the issue of whether the United States ought to continue to grant citizenship to any child born in the country, even if the parents are illegal immigrants. "You know, the anchor baby thing has always really hacked me off," Beck said. "You know the anchor baby. You know what that is. It's when a child that is born here, becomes a citizen and they help the illegal parents become citizens, right?" He continued, sarcastically, "Remember empathy. Oh, empathy. No one wants to separate that family. Oh, that baby is a child. It's an anchor. It's an anchor to stay here." "Why do we have automatic citizenship upon birth?" Beck asked. "Do you know? We're the only country in the world that has it. Why?" Beck went on to explain that the 14th amendment granting citizenship to "all persons born or naturalized in the United States" was drafted after the Civil War "to protect newly freed slaves and their children and guarantee their rights as citizens. Last I checked, I don't think we're having that problem anymore. Can we have some common sense?" Beck touches on an issue that has caught the attention of a growing number of Republicans in Congress. In April, Rep. Nathan Deal, a Republican candidate for governor of Georgia, proposed H.R. 1868, the Birthright Citizenship Act of 2009. It seeks to amend immigration law so that babies born in the United States would only be granted U.S. citizenship if one of the parents is 1) a U.S. citizen or national; 2) a legal permanent resident of the United States; or 3) is serving in the U.S. armed forces. The bill currently has 77 cosponsors, 76 Republicans and one Democrat. Every year, about 400,000 babies are born to mothers who are undocumented immigrants in the United States, acccording to Jon Feere, a legal policy analyst at the Center for Immigration Studies. Once those children become adults, they can sponsor their parents or extended family for legal permanent residency. Our aim is not to enter the fray over the proposed legislation but to check Beck's claim that the United States is the only country in the world that grants automatic citizenship to anyone born in the country. And to that end, we refer to a report from NumbersUSA, a group dedicated to reducing immigration levels, and which backs Deal's bill. They found that in addition to the United States, there are 33 countries that offer automatic, unconditional citizenship to children born within their borders. They offer several qualifiers. No European nations grant birthright citizenship (but we note that Romania is on the list). Canada is the only developed nation other than the United States. No nation in the group other than the United States has more than 200 million people. Only the United States, Pakistan and Mexico have 50 million or more. For the full list, go here . By way of reminder, Beck said, "We're the only country in the world that has it." We might be inclined to cut Beck some slack if the only other countries were Saint Lucia, Antigua and Lesotho. In fact, we'll even admit that we had to look up what continent Lesotho is even on (Africa). But Canada, Brazil, Romania? We didn't have to go looking for those. It might be surprising to Americans that automatic citizenship isn't more common in the developed world, but the bottom line is Beck made a blanket statement that is just wrong. We rate his statement False.	None	Glenn Beck	None	None	None	2009-06-19T13:50:53	2009-06-10	['None']
pomt-04123	Ohio's judges, "compared to other similar states, are being woefully underpaid."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2013/jan/09/bill-seitz/bill-seitz-says-ohios-judges-are-woefully-underpai/	Ohio's 129th General Assembly ended its two-year session in December after acting on dozens of measures during a busy, post-election lame-duck period. One proposal that never reached consideration as legislation, however, was a plan to give a cost-of-living pay increase to state and local elected officials. Sen. Bill Seitz, a Republican from Cincinnati, pushed for an increase that would have taken effect Jan. 1, 2014, if the legislature appropriated enough money in the next biennial budget to cover the cost. Seitz, who had earlier supported raises for judges, noted that judges, legislators, county commissioners, sheriffs, prosecutors and other elected officials have had no increase in pay since January 2008. Those increases were the result of a bill, passed by the legislature in 2000, which enacted pay raises for the next eight years equal to the consumer price index or 3 percent. "This is the price you pay to get qualified people to do consequential things," Seitz told the Columbus Dispatch. "Study after study has shown that our judges, compared to other similar states, are being woefully underpaid." Senate President Tom Niehaus and House Speaker Bill Batchelder let Seitz's proposal die in caucus, but PolitiFact Ohio was still interested in his statement about the comparatively low level of judicial pay. We called Seitz's office to ask for background. They didn't get back to us during a holiday week, but our own search turned up several supporting sources. Chief among them was the "Survey of Judicial Salaries," which has been published annually for nearly 30 years by the National Center for State Courts. The most recent survey, published last July, found that Ohio ranked 41st among the 50 states in average pay for common pleas judges, or general jurisdiction trial courts. The national average pay for common pleas judge was $137,000 in 2011, compared to $121,350 in Ohio. Ohio's Supreme Court ranked 33rd in pay, with an annual salary of $141,600. The pay for Ohio’s appellate judges ranked 30th, at $132,000. That put Ohio in the bottom half for each category, according to the NCSC, which noted that Ohio judges have not had a raise since 2008. (Salaries for full-time municipal court judges are $114,100 while part-time municipal court judges and county court judges have annual salaries of $65,650.) A 2011 report from the Ohio Judicial Conference found that the pay for judges at the Supreme Court, appeals courts and common pleas courts in Ohio was below pay levels in the "peer states" of Illinois, Michigan, New York and Pennsylvania. And a 2011 analysis from the NCSC on judicial pay in Massachusetts included what it called the "startling" finding that judges' salaries in the Bay State "fare worse than every other industrial state except Ohio." What's the verdict on Seitz’s statement? Saying that Ohio's judges are "woefully underpaid" is a matter of opinion that PolitiFact Ohio can't rate. That’s a point for clarification. But Seitz was accurate in asserting that Ohio's judges are paid less "compared to other similar states." They are, in fact, paid less at every level than are judges in most other states. On the Truth-O-Meter, his statement rates Mostly True.	None	Bill Seitz	None	None	None	2013-01-09T06:00:00	2013-01-10	['Ohio']
pomt-11432	The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that public school in the United States "will not teach the tenets of Islam or Sharia Law."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/15/nowtrumpcom/no-supreme-court-didnt-ban-sharia-law-schools/	A viral story said that the U.S. Supreme Court sided with President Donald Trump and ruled that public schools will not teach Sharia law. "Breaking: Supreme Court sides with Trump - this changes everything!" said a March 9 headline on Nowtrump.com, a pro-Trump fake news website. The story said that the court ruled that public school in the United States "will not teach the tenets of Islam or Sharia Law." We found that this story recycles misinformation from 2017 about a court ruling that doesn’t exist. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The story said that on behalf of the U.S. Education Department, Trump’s legal team petitioned the court to make America safer. The Supreme Court ruled 5-3 that public schools "will not teach the tenets of Islam or Sharia Law." However, Nowtrump.com (a play on the "never Trump" movement) wrote that according to USA Politics Today, students will learn about Islam, as they do about other religions, in history. (Snopes fact-checked the USA Politics Today story in 2017, which is similar to the Nowtrump story.) The Nowtrump.com story then made up inflammatory quotes by Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch. "We certainly shouldn’t be filling the children with lies about Islam being a ‘religion of peace’ when they see the carnage on the news almost every day," Gorsuch said, according to the article. We found no actual quote by Gorsuch, and the timing of the alleged court ruling makes no sense based on when Gorsuch joined the court. FactCheck.org fact-checked a similar story on another website on April 11, 2017, and noted that Gorsuch didn’t hear his first case until April 17 -- about a week after the fake news story first appeared. It is worth noting that public schools can teach about religion, according to a 1963 U.S. Supreme Court ruling. In Abington vs. Schempp, Associate Justice Tom Clark wrote for the court: "It might well be said that one’s education is not complete without a study of comparative religion or the history of religion and its relationship to the advancement of civilization. It certainly may be said that the Bible is worthy of study for its literary and historic qualities. Nothing we have said here indicates that such study of the Bible or of religion, when presented objectively as part of a secular program of education may not be effected consistently with the First Amendment." Nowtrump.com wrote that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that public school in the United States "will not teach the tenets of Islam or Sharia Law." There has been no such ruling banning schools from teaching about Islam or Sharia law. The story includes made-up quotes by Gorsuch. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-01765	"I'm not a conspiracy theorist and I never allow conspiracy theorists on my program."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/30/peter-lavelle/rts-peter-lavelle-says-he-doesnt-allow-conspiracy-/	Peter Lavelle hosts CrossTalk on RT, an English language cable news network funded by the Russian government. Lavelle opens each edition of CrossTalk by saying it’s a place "where all things are considered." Everything except, he says, conspiracy theories. Lavelle’s commentary on Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 thrust him into the media spotlight with a contentious, 10-minute interview with CNN’s Chris Cuomo, who accused Lavelle of being obsessed with "clearing Russia from culpability" in the plane’s shooting. American officials have said the plane was likely shot down by Ukrainian separatists in Donetsk with a surface-to-air missile. Lavelle, an American who works as a journalist in Moscow, says the United States is too quick to tie Russian-backed rebels to the tragedy, berating the U.S. State Department for relying on social media as evidence for its claims and not looking at Ukraine as a responsible party. "I'm not a conspiracy theorist and I never allow conspiracy theorists on my program," Lavelle said on the July 23 CrossTalk, addressing guest Vladimir Suchan. Then Lavelle proposed a theory that involves Ukraine bringing down the plane in effort to earn worldwide sympathy amid woes with its new government. "But if I look at the timing of this tragedy in Ukraine, the (Petro) Poroshenko government was, well, in trouble with its latest offensive in the east, it was losing badly, soldiers were being circled, it was really bad news," Lavelle said. "And all of a sudden we have this tragedy of killing civilians on this flight, and this puts Ukraine back on the front page, it competes with Gaza, a lot of ‘sympathy,’ for the Kiev regime, this is good timing in a way for the coup regime that hasn't been achieving too many successes since February." Um, so in essence Lavelle is suggesting Ukraine shot down MH 17 so it could blame the Russian separatists so the flailing Ukraine government could become front-and-center again in the news? Sounds like a conspiracy theory to us. But so that we don’t be accused of reaching a Pants on Fire conclusion too quickly, we decided to search around Lavelle’s other shows. We didn’t search every program, but we looked at enough to find that conspiracy theories are very much raised by Lavelle and featured on his show. RT is a curiosity for Western journalists, some of whom see its coverage as Kremlin-directed propaganda. As a star host, Lavelle has gotten and dismissed questions about the network's perceived bias. In 2008, he told a New York Times reporter, "No one is telling me what to say." He did, however, note that part of the network's "mission is public relations." RT has also carved out a reputation for bringing in obscure guests to discuss unusual topics related to America, devoting time to questioning President Barack Obama’s birth certificate. Lavelle, too, has expressed his preference to be "counterintuitive" compared to corporate-owned American cable news networks. In a 2010 interview with Columbia Journalism Review, Lavelle said, "Being mainstream has been very dangerous for the West." Here’s a few of those conspiratorial, er, counterintuitive moments that we found with a simple Google search. Conspiracy No. 1: 9/11 was an inside job Lavelle invited several skeptics of the American government's Sept. 11 findings "to try to find out what really happened" on 9/11 for a March 2010 segment. The roster included Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth founder Richard Gage, who said three World Trade Center skyscrapers (the Twin Towers and a surrounding WTC building) that collapsed that day "were brought down by explosive demolition on 9/11, not by fire and jet plane impacts." Lavelle also asked blogger Ian Henshall, a blogger and author of 9/11 Revealed: The New Evidence, about what it's like to be called a conspiracy theorist when he's just raising questions. "Conspiracy theory, if it means anything, is a simple story which you know claims to explain a major complicated event. That is exactly what the official story of the 9/11 attacks is," Henshall said. "Very simple story, all organized by a guy in the cave with 17 hijackers who were just incredibly lucky. You could not get more of a conspiracy theory than that." Henshall went on to talk about the "worrying evidence" that the towers-takedown was an inside job. Just so we don't raise the eyebrows of conspiracy theorists, we took three screengrabs of Lavelle and his guests talking about 9/11 conspiracy theories from RT's YouTube page: 1. "WTC towers collapsed due to a controlled demolition;" 2. "Attacks an inside job to justify wars in Afghanistan and Iraq;" 3. "9/11 attacks in 2001 were intentionally allowed to happen." It wasn't the first time Lavelle raised eyebrows about the official story of Sept. 11. In February 2010, Lavelle posited on CrossTalk that the Sept. 11 hijackers were "not even fundamentalists at all" -- much to the shock of the two people he was interviewing about a proposed burqa ban in France. This time he was challenged by a guest, former British journalist Douglas Murray of the Centre for Social Adhesion, who asked Lavelle, "How can you keep speaking, let alone hosting a show, and know so little? How can you know so little and keep on talking?" Murray detailed the appearance on the "strange propaganda outfit" in a blogpost. The other guest, Anne-Elisabeth Moutet of the Jean-Jacques Rousseau Institute, said al-Qaida is a completely fundamentalist group. Conspiracy No. 2: AIDS drugs kill people with AIDS Lavelle later convened a panel to talk about the business of HIV/AIDS on July 21, 2010, asking questions that highlighted critics of antiretroviral therapy for people infected with HIV who say the treatments are nothing but a "huge moneybag" for Big Pharma. Lavelle invited on guest Peter Duesberg, a University of California-Berkeley professor of molecular and cell biology, who believes that AIDS treatments are killing people infected with "the so-called AIDS virus, which doesn’t do anything." So AIDS isn’t killing people, AIDS drugs are. "The companies try to treat the virus that doesn’t do anything with drugs that are inevitably toxic," Duesberg said. "The AZT was developed 40 years ago for one purpose: to kill human cells for cancer, chemotherapy. And the result is they have never ever cured one AIDS patient." Lavelle asked Dr. Denis Broun of UNAIDS for feedback. "We have 2 million people die of HIV infection every year. And these are not people who die of old age, I can tell you that. The average age of people who die in Russia is 32 years. This is preposterous," Broun said. "The antiretrovirals are keeping people alive, and people are staying alive thanks to administration of these products." Lavelle went back to Duesberg, who said the world’s 30-40 million HIV-infected population is doing well and the people who die are the ones "getting these drugs that are inevitably toxic." ‘They are designed to terminate DNA synthesis, that’s the central molecule of life, you’re dying from that," Duesberg said. "That is AIDS by prescription. And 500,000 people are prescribed these drugs alone in the U.S. and all of them die, about half of them die from diseases that have nothing to do with HIV." Another guest, Steve Caterer of Global Pharma Insights, said Duesberg’s opinions "on the good side are disrespectful and on the worst side are tantamount to murder." Later in the program, Broun said the three-drug HIV/AIDS drug treatment used today is much less toxic than the AZT-only treatment (azidothymidine) used 25 years ago. "No one in his right sense is suggesting to use AZT alone today," he said. "It's as if people were suggesting to treat syphilis with arsenic, as was done at the beginning of the century. ... We cannot discuss today's situation with antique data that are no longer valid in any way." Broun said researchers debate some points of treating the virus, but "no one is saying, like denying the role of HIV in creating AIDS or saying the drugs are dangerous for people." Conspiracy No. 3: U.S. official planned to break up Ukraine Back to Ukraine, where Lavelle lambasted American media coverage of the "Western-induced crisis" in May 2014, and claimed that Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland was trying to break up Ukraine. "It seems to me that there’s this habit now in Western media, particularly in the United States, that no one wants to see fault in themselves or their own governments here. Because this was so predictable, as you said at the beginning of the program, this plan that Victoria Nuland had was just nonsense. She was just going to break up the country, but they had a Plan B. If they don’t succeed, then Russia is a very easy enemy to blame everything on, and that’s exactly what we’re seeing right now." Even guest Dmitry Babich, an employee of the Russian-government owned radio station The Voice of Russia, thought Lavelle was going a bit too far. "I don’t think Victoria Nuland planned to break up the country. She thought that the east of Ukraine would just submit to the new government, the new government would be pro-Western, then as the Western media said, we should all take deep breath and then wait until Ukraine becomes completely anti-Russian," Babich said. "And of course Victoria Nuland, just like John Kerry, they don’t know a thing about Ukraine." Nuland became a notorious figure in the East as U.S. diplomats responded to Ukraine's political crisis, but there's no evidence she had a plan to break up Ukraine. A phone conversation between Nuland and U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt about Ukraine's next steps was leaked, in which she was heard as saying "F--- the EU." Routine remarks from Nuland about the United States' investment in pro-democracy initiatives in Ukraine since it broke off from the Soviet Union in 1991 were widely misconstrued on social media and by RT, which held up her comments as evidence that the U.S. was spending $5 billion to incite the riots (a claim we rated Pants on Fire). Our ruling "Never" is a strong word, yet Lavelle claimed he is a not a conspiracy theorist and has "never allowed a conspiracy theorist on his show." We’ll agree there is a somewhat subjective definition of what constitutes a conspiracy theory. But we think of the four we quickly found -- Ukraine downed MH 17 to drum up sympathy, AIDS drugs are what are killings AIDS patients, 9/11 was an inside job, and an assistant secretary of state devised a plan to break-up Ukraine -- at least one would fit most people’s definition of a conspiracy theory. Lavelle’s hypothesis about MH 17, we should note, was uttered in the breaths after saying he doesn’t allow conspiracy theories on his show. We rate his statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-05493	Says his Texas election fraud investigations have resulted in 50 convictions.	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/apr/17/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-claims-50-election-fraud-convictions-2/	Texas’ attorney general, Greg Abbott, says he needs the state’s stalled voter identification mandate to ward off fraud at the polls. When the U.S. Justice Department rejected the Texas voter ID law March 12, 2012, preventing it from taking effect, Abbott issued a press release saying: "Since 2002 ... election fraud investigations by the Texas Attorney General's Office have resulted in 50 convictions." We asked Abbott’s office for backup on his statement, and spokesman Jerry Strickland sent a list of 57 election fraud prosecutions, as well as documents showing how the cases were resolved. We also asked how many election fraud cases had been referred to the attorney general’s office since 2002. Abbott’s list shows 311 accusations of election fraud spanning 2002-12. The 57 investigations we’re checking represent only those cases that were both prosecuted and resolved. Six of the prosecutions ended in dismissal or acquittal, Strickland told us by telephone, leaving 51 prosecutions that resulted in convictions. By our analysis, three-quarters of the cases involved election code violations classified as "illegal voting" -- which includes acts such as voting more than once, impersonating a voter or voting despite ineligibility -- and "method of returning marked ballot," often meaning the defendant was accused of having someone else’s ballot. Only two cases are described as "voter impersonation" on the list. Whether voter impersonation is a standing problem has been a hot button in the state’s legislative debates over proposed voter ID laws in 2005, 2007, 2009 and 2011; Austin American-Statesman news stories say legislators mostly split along party lines, with Democrats claiming impersonation is rare and Republicans claiming the problem is significant. Abbott drew criticism in 2006 for creating a special unit to target voter fraud that by mid-2008 had yielded, according to a May 19, 2008, Associated Press news story, only 26 prosecutions. Looking at all 57 election fraud prosecutions from 2002 to 2012, we tallied up the resolutions (some had multiple outcomes, when charges were pursued as separate cases): Specified as convictions: 26 Guilty plea resulting in conviction: 2 Deferred adjudication: 19 Pre-trial diversion: 10 Acquitted: 2 Dismissed: 4 For clarification of the middle two categories, we turned to the Texas District and County Attorneys Association, an Austin-based nonprofit that provides continuing legal education and technical assistance to prosecutors. The group’s executive director, Rob Kepple, told us in an interview that although deferred adjudication falls short of a conviction, he would not consider it a stretch to classify it with the convictions. In deferred adjudication, Kepple said, the defendant pleads guilty, and then "the court defers any finding of guilt and places you on probation or community supervision." If the terms are met, the case is dismissed -- but it remains on the defendant’s record, he said. This means it can carry the weight of a conviction in later cases, Kepple said. For example, if a person is given deferred adjudication in a domestic violence case and then later is charged again with domestic violence, he said, the adjudication counts as the first offense, making the new charge a second offense. But a pre-trial diversion is not a conviction, he said. There’s not even necessarily a guilty plea or admission of guilt. "Basically, they sat down with the defendant and say, ‘Here’s what’s going to happen. You agree not to mess up for 12 months and we’ll just dismiss the case.’ So in no common parlance can this be considered a conviction," Kepple said. The case can even be expunged from the defendant’s record, he said. "There’s no way you can mistake a pre-trial diversion for a conviction, I don’t think." We also consulted the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association, a group that provides support and education for its members. Like Kepple, the association’s capital assistance attorney, Rick Wardroup, pointed out via email that the final outcome of a pre-trial diversion or deferred adjudication depends on whether the defendant meets the terms of their probation or supervision. Abbott spokeswoman Lauren Bean told us by telephone that the attorney general counts pre-trial diversions as a successful outcome for two main reasons: First, although the defendants do not plead guilty, such agreements are made in order to avoid an expected criminal trial, and second, because the defendant receives a punishment. After we shared our findings with her, Bean sent us another bit of backup: a section of Texas local government code on court costs that classes deferred adjudication and pre-trial diversions with convictions. University of Texas law school assistant professor Jennifer Laurin told us via email that clauses like this in state laws indicate the reverse -- they illustrate that these two outcomes are not normally considered convictions. And Kepple said, "That section is the definition of ‘conviction’ for the purpose of collecting fines and fees. But in common parlance, a deferred prosecution and deferred adjudications simply are not criminal convictions." Our ruling Abbott’s statement refers to 50 "convictions," which he might better have termed "satisfactory results." It looks to us like 60 percent of his cited "convictions" were not convictions. We recognize, though, that our analysis presumes that all the non-convicted defendants fulfilled or will fulfill all terms of the agreements they made to avoid going to trial. That may not be so. On balance, we rate Abbott’s claim Half True.	None	Greg Abbott	None	None	None	2012-04-17T15:38:20	2012-03-12	['Texas']
pomt-01740	Ed Gillespie "supports a personhood amendment."	false	/virginia/statements/2014/aug/04/mark-warner/warner-says-gillespie-supports-personhood-amendmen/	During a sharp exchange at their first debate, U.S. Sen. Mark Warner insisted that GOP challenger Ed Gillespie supports laws that would provide embryos with rights the moment of conception. "He supports a personhood amendment that is so far out of the mainstream that it would ban certain common forms of contraception," Warner, a Democrat, said during the July 26 debate. He cast Gillespie as sympathetic towards several other socially conservative policies. Gillespie protested. "This is an area where you’re making up my views," he said. "Please provide the documentation for my support of any of those things." Warner persisted, directly asking Gillespie if he ever supported a personhood amendment. "No," Gillespie said. "Provide documentation of that. When did I support a personhood amendment?" "We’ll give you the documentation," Warner replied. Shortly after the debate, his campaign put out an email saying that Gillespie was chairman of the Republican National Committee in 2004 when the party adopted a national platform calling for a personhood amendment. The platform said, "As a country, we must keep our pledge to the first guarantee of the Declaration of Independence. That is why we say the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed. We support a human life amendment to the Constitution, and we endorse legislation to make it clear that the Fourteenth Amendment’s protections apply to unborn children." As our colleagues at PolitiFact national have noted, the human life amendment would assert that legal personhood begins at conception and with it, constitutional protection. Personhood legislation has drawn enormous debate in Virginia and across the nation. Supporters say the laws provide a legal remedy if an unborn child is killed by neglect or a third party. Opponents say the measures are a ruse to challenge rights to abortion and contraceptives that could prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in a uterus. Gillespie "had an understanding of the platform, and what was in it," said David Turner, Warner’s campaign spokesman. "He was chair of the RNC and on the platform committee that crafted the language." Gillespie was RNC chairman from 2003 to 2005. We should note that GOP has adopted platforms calling for a human life amendment at each of its national conventions since 1984, according to records kept by the American Presidency Project at the University of California at Santa Barbara. All this is in the past, however. Warner’s statement was in the present tense. He said Gillespie "supports a personhood amendment." Turner shifted to 2014 by pointing to the National Right to Life’s endorsement of Gillespie in May. The anti-abortion group said Gillespie, when he was RNC chairman, "worked closely with pro-life leaders to ensure the platform remained resolute in seeking to restore legal protection to unborn children threatened by abortion…" We repeatedly asked officials at National Right to Life group to specify actions Gillespie took to ensure the GOP stood hard on a personhood amendment but didn’t receive a direct answer. Turner noted that Gillespie tweeted news of his Right to Life endorsement. "By touting a release that specifically referenced his work on a platform that had language described as calling for a personhood amendment, he has effectively endorsed that work during this campaign," Turner emailed. Gillespie, on his website, says he’s "pro-life," and opposes taxpayer funding of abortion. He doesn’t mention a personhood amendment. Paul Logan, Gillespie’s campaign spokesman, emailed us last week that "Ed doesn’t support a personhood amendment." Our ruling Warner says Gillespie "supports a personhood amendment." Gillespie says he doesn’t and challenged the senator to prove his claim. Gillespie was certainly national GOP chairman in 2004 when the party adopted a platform supporting a human life amendment. But we haven’t seen any clear personal expression from his supporting such a law either then or now. So Warner has failed to prove his claim. We rate Warner’s statement False.

pomt-00038	Says Joe Manchin "supported Obama and Clinton's campaigns to kill coal jobs."	false	/west-virginia/statements/2018/nov/05/patrick-morrisey/did-joe-manchin-support-obama-and-clinton-efforts-/	Donald Trump Jr. tweeted his support for Republican U.S. Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey — and his opposition to Morrissey's Democratic incumbent, Sen. Joe Manchin — on Oct. 13, 2018. Trump Jr. tweeted, "Liberal Joe Manchin can’t be trusted to fight for West Virginia. He sold out Mountaineers when he supported Hillary Clinton over my father & on just about every other issue imaginable." The tweet attached a Morrissey campaign ad that included the charge that Manchin "supported Obama and Clinton’s campaigns to kill coal jobs." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Those are fighting words in coal-producing West Virginia. So we wondered whether it is accurate that Manchin supported Hillary Clinton’s and Barack Obama’s efforts to kill coal jobs. As we have previously noted, Manchin did back Clinton in the 2016 election — an endorsement that turned out to be strongly at odds with most voters in a state that voted strongly for her Republican opponent, Donald Trump. (Manchin later told Politico that his decision to stick by Clinton was "a mistake. It was a mistake politically.") But the Morrissey ad didn’t just refer to Manchin’s endorsement of the candidates. It went a step further and said that Manchin specifically supported their coal policies. And that doesn’t appear to be correct. In his initial campaign for Senate in 2010, he famously ran an ad in which he shot a copy of the cap-and-trade bill proposed by Obama and other Democrats that would have curbed emissions, potentially hurting the coal industry. (The bill was never enacted.) In an 2013 Washington Post article, Manchin said that Obama’s climate initiative -- which would have put coal at a disadvantage to other forms of energy -- amounted to a declaration of war on the coal industry. "The regulations the President wants to force on coal are not feasible. And if it’s not feasible, it’s not reasonable," Manchin said. Manchin went on to say in the article that it is not acceptable to get rid of coal. "It’s clear now that the president has declared a war on coal. It’s simply unacceptable that one of the key elements of his climate change proposal places regulations on coal that are completely impossible to meet with existing technology." He joined Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., to introduce the Affordable Reliable Energy Now Act, which the lawmakers touted as helping "rein in President Obama’s Clean Power Plan." In 2015, he emphasized his opposition to Obama’s Clean Power Plan in a letter to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy. He also urged constituents to direct their opposition to the plan at field hearings. Saying he believed that the plan would "result in escalating utility bills for Mountain State residents and even more coal mining job losses," Manchin wrote that "forcing new coal-fired plants to meet standards when experts know that the required technology is not sustainably operational on a commercial scale makes absolutely no sense. By requiring technology that has never been adequately demonstrated, the EPA is forcing an industry to shut down and consumers to pay higher utility bills." He also voted to advance a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act to reverse the "Waters of the U.S." (WOTUS) rule, arguing that it would "impact the coal mining in West Virginia." Manchin’s Senate website also examples of Manchin supporting the coal industry, such as introducing in 2018 the Fossil Energy Utilization, Enhancement, and Leadership Act, which was designed to "protect coal jobs and develop new technologies to be used domestically and exported internationally," and supporting efforts to use the Defense Production Act to protect "clean-burning, coal-fired power plants." The Morrisey campaign did not respond to repeated requests to offer examples of Manchin opposing the coal industry. Our ruling A tweet posted by Patrick Morrisey and shared by Donald Trump Jr. said that Manchin "supported Obama and Clinton's campaigns to kill coal jobs." Manchin actively opposed the two biggest efforts backed by Obama and Clinton over coal industry opposition: the cap-and-trade bill and the Clean Power Plan. He also pursued other legislative and regulatory efforts that aided the coal industry. We rate the statement False.

mpws-00040	With the Republican endorsing convention more than a month away, the state’s DFL party still has a wide field of GOP candidates to target. Among them is state Sen. Julianne Ortman, R-Chanhassen, who is seeking her party’s endorsement to run against Democratic Sen. Al Franken. The DFL is using Ortman’s record as a legislator to paint her as out of step with Minnesota. Here’s what DFL chair Ken Martin said in a recent press release about Ortman after she was endorsed by former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. “[Ortman] is wrong on women’s reproductive health, voting for a bill that defunded all family planning programs in the state. She’s wrong on immigration reform, saying she would have opposed the overwhelmingly bipartisan Senate immigration bill. And she’s wrong on health care, promising to repeal the Affordable Care Act and take us back to the days when people with pre-existing conditions couldn’t get covered and insurance companies were allowed to charge women more than men for coverage.” 	accurate	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2014/04/poligraph-dfl-claims-about-ortmans-record-mostly-true/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: DFL claims about Ortman’s record mostly true	April 4, 2014, 2:00 PM	None	['Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Minnesota', 'Alaska', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Sarah_Palin', 'Minnesota_Democratic–Farmer–Labor_Party', 'Al_Franken']
pomt-08877	Mortgage fraud is "up 400 percent in the last five years."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/aug/02/pam-bondi/pam-bondi-says-mortgage-fraud-400-percent/	At their first televised debate, the three Republican candidates for attorney general got a chance to address why fraud seemed to be so rampant in Florida and what they, if elected, would do to stop it. Lt. Gov. Jeff Kottkamp talked about Medicaid fraud, and how the state must do a better job recouping that money. Former Agency for Health Care Administration secretary Holly Benson talked about Florida being ranked No. 1 in terms of automobile accident fraud. Former Hillsborough prosecutor Pam Bondi then zeroed in on mortgage fraud. "Mortgage fraud is through the roof," Bondi said during the hour-long debate taped on July 31, 2010, for Bay News 9 in Tampa Bay and CFN 13 in Orlando and broadcast the following day. "It's up 400 percent in the last five years. That's outrageous. We shouldn't have to be dealing with that." It's a simple, but staggering assertion -- and one we thought was worth exploring. First things first, Bondi's campaign told us she was referring to nationwide statistics and not just Florida. That's an important distinction because the question was related to Florida. Still, the campaign turned us to a Department of Treasury fraud report to back up her claim. Using FBI statistics, Treasury said that the FBI investigated more than 2,100 mortgage fraud cases in 2009, a 400 percent increase from five years ago (Page 7 of the report). The report, dated June 14, 2010, attributes the rise in mortgage fraud investigations to "declining economic conditions," "liberal underwriting" and "declining home values." The FBI's own report produces slightly different numbers, but a similar percentage increase. From 2005-2009, the FBI reported its mortgage fraud investigations increased from 721 to 2,794 -- a 387.5 percent increase. From 2006-2010, the pending mortgage fraud investigations are 3,029 -- which would translate to a nearly 344 percent increase over that five-year period. You can see the bureau's entire report on mortgage fraud here, which includes descriptions on current mortgage fraud scams. In a credit enhancement scheme, for example, a mortgage fraud perpetrator artificially boosts a borrower's credit to qualify him for a loan. Other types of fraud include bogus appraisals, or fake foreclosure rescue schemes. The FBI reports that mortgage fraud is particularly an issue in Florida. In 2009, the Tampa FBI field office opened more mortgage fraud investigations than any other FBI office in the country, the FBI said. Mortgage fraud investigations spiked 363 percent in Tampa in one year, according to the FBI, from 41 in 2008 to 190 in 2009. Florida also ranked first in the nation in same-day property flips, according to the FBI. (An exchange of property that occurs on the day of sale is considered suspect for illegal property flipping). U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has used the FBI data to make the case for additional resources and legislation to combat mortgage fraud, and in particular noted that FBI investigations are up "almost 400 percent from five years ago." But the FBI isn't the only agency that investigates mortgage fraud. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which is part of the Department of Treasury, collects and tracks Suspicious Activity Reports of mortgage fraud that are submitted anonymously from financial institutions across the country. The Suspicious Activity Reports are like tips, said spokesman Bill Grassano. Those tips can either lead to investigations by some 300 law enforcement agencies across the country, or help identify trends. In other cases, there was no crime. Reports of possible mortgage fraud increased from 25,931 in 2005 to 67,360 in 2009, according to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. That's a big increase, about 260 percent, but not as large as the increase in investigations reported by the FBI. We also checked in with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to see if the agency had any statewide numbers. FDLE spokeswoman Heather Smith said the agency does not track specifically the number of mortgage fraud cases statewide. Smith provided PolitiFact Florida with two FDLE mortgage fraud assessment reports, from 2005 and 2007, that use both FBI investigation figures and the Suspicious Activity Reports to highlight national trends. Back to Bondi's statement. She said mortgage fraud is up "400 percent in the last five years." Bondi has her numbers right, but the nearly 400 percent increase is referring specifically to FBI investigations of mortgage fraud nationwide, and does not account for state and local investigations, or information collected through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Bondi could have been more specific with where her figure was coming from. As such, we rate her statement Mostly True.	None	Pam Bondi	None	None	None	2010-08-02T18:24:00	2010-07-31	['None']

pomt-01460	"We have 41,000 people right now on the waitlist for financial-based assistance for our tech colleges and universities," most of them for tech schools.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/02/mary-burke/mary-burke-says-41000-people-are-waitlist-financia/	Democrat Mary Burke thinks the technical-college tuition freeze promised by Gov. Scott Walker could backfire on students. If state aid to tech schools isn’t boosted at the same time, the candidate for governor argues, a tuition freeze could force elimination of in-demand courses. Burke doesn’t rule out backing a tuition freeze herself if she wins the Nov. 4, 2014 election. But she says it’s more important to get financial support to students so they can afford to go to school -- such as by increasing state aid to keep college affordable. "The bigger issue I think is we have 41,000 people right now on the waitlist for financial-based assistance for our tech colleges and universities, and most of those people are on the waitlist for tech colleges," Burke said during a Sept. 22, 2014 interview by Wisconsin Eye. Were that many students turned down? To back her claim, Burke’s campaign pointed us to a July 31, 2014 memo prepared by the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau for state Sen. Jennifer Shilling (D-La Crosse). We also tracked down a later memo from the agency dated Aug. 19, 2014. Both memos examined Wisconsin Grants, the state-funded program that gives need-based grants to undergraduate students enrolled at least half-time in one of four sectors: UW-System institutions, tech colleges, private and nonprofit schools or tribal colleges. You must be a state resident to receive the money. All told, the state spent about $106 million in 2013-’14 on the grants. Though perhaps not as well known as federal financial aid programs, the state program helps a lot of people. At UW schools and tech schools alone, nearly 57,000 students received grants for the 2013-’14 year. UW schools receive an allotment, and the tech schools work from a separate pot of money. The average grant for a UW student was $1,775; for tech students, $994. In the tech system, it’s first-come, first-served for the grants. In the UW System, it’s first-come, first-served until each campus’ allocation is spent. In the 2013-’14 year, more than 41,000 financial aid applicants who were eligible for state help did not get any due to lack of funds, according to the Fiscal Bureau memo. More than nine out of 10 of those rejected were tech-school applicants, the memo said. The Fiscal Bureau figures are on target, according to John Reinemann, executive secretary of the Wisconsin Higher Educational Aids Board, which administers the grants, and Conor Smyth, director of Strategic Partnerships and External Relations for the Wisconsin Technical College System. Those who did not get a grant are put on a list in case they are still in school if grant money becomes available. Demand started to exceed supply of grant money during the Great Recession, when more people were returning to school for retraining and diminished incomes meant many more were eligible to receive aid. The "unmet need" reached as high as 80,000 in 2009, statistics show. The tech schools alone saw 54,000 applicants get turned down in 2012. A word about the numbers There’s somewhat less than meets the eye with the waiting list figures, however. There’s some potential -- though apparently relatively minor -- overlap between the UW System and the Wisconsin Technical College System figures. The tech schools put you on a waiting list if you are eligible for one of their awards, and you listed a tech school as the number one choice on your financial aid application. The Fiscal Bureau points out it’s not known how many of those applicants actually enroll at a tech school. They might have enrolled in a UW or private college instead -- and might even have secured a grant from one of those institutions. And while some may have done so because they didn’t get a tech-school grant, others went a different route for other reasons. This situation means the tech school list likely overstates the unmet need to some extent, Fiscal Bureau analyst Emily Pope wrote. Conversely, the UW list -- which includes only students who actually enrolled in a UW school -- likely understates it because it doesn’t include applicants who may have enrolled there if they had received a UW grant, So for all those reasons, the 41,000 waitlist figure is the best we have, but not rock solid. Our rating Burke said: "We have 41,000 people right now on the waitlist for financial-based assistance for our tech colleges and universities," most of them for tech schools. There is a large waiting list, and Burke cites a credible source on its size. But some variations in how the lists are defined by the different institutions mean the number should be treated with some caution. We rate her claim Mostly True.

pomt-01860	On the last night of the General Assembly, "by 11 o'clock 95 to 98 percent of the business was done. So we really didn't have that late-night session. We were just holding on one bill."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2014/jul/13/nicholas-mattiello/ri-speaker-nicholas-mattiello-says-legislature-did/	Some things in life are a certainty -- death, taxes and members of the Rhode Island General Assembly staying up until the early morning hours to pass a flurry of legislation on the final day of the session. On the edition of WPRI-TV's "Newsmakers" program that aired July 6, 2014, reporter Tim White was talking to House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello about the assembly session that had just ended. He noted that legislators were passing bills as late as 4 a.m. White questioned whether they had time to fully consider them before voting and asked, "Is this how you think the legislative process should happen?" Mattiello argued that the House really didn't have an all-night session this year. "We kept to our curfew every night of the last week of (the) session," he said. "Most of the business, even on the last night of the session, was concluded by, I think, roughly 11 o'clock." "The session went late because of negotiations with the Senate over a Newport Grand gambling bill. So there was that one bill," Mattiello said. "Most of the business, and I don't want to be fact-checked, but I think by 11 o'clock 95 to 98 percent of the business was done. So we really didn't have that late-night session. We were just holding on one bill." (He was referring to legislation, later signed by Governor Chafee, authorizing referenda on whether table games should be allowed at the slot parlor.) Mattiello may not have wanted to be fact-checked, but we couldn’t resist, because we had a very different recollection of a legislative day that didn't officially end until 4:06 Saturday morning. The last vote was at 3:48 in the morning. So was 95 to 98 percent of the business done by 11 p.m.? Was only one bill at issue? And did the House not really have a late-night session? When we contacted Mattiello's office, spokesman Larry Berman said in an email that "There were 126 votes taken by House members on the final day of session (June 20). Of those, 87 were made before 11 p.m." That's 69 percent, not 95 to 98 percent. However, Berman said, Mattiello was referring to new business. Most of those after-11-p.m. votes don't count, he argued, because all but one of those issues had already been debated before by the House. That's a distinction the speaker didn't make on Newsmakers. The remaining votes did consist largely of cleaning up language so House and Senate versions were identical on bills that allowed optometrists to prescribe the opiate drug hydrocodone; regulated music therapists; authorized special license plates for Olympic medal winners, and eliminated the so-called master level that provides for straight-party voting. But those are still final votes on important issues. Those votes are not insignificant. And when you don't leave the building until after 4 a.m., that's a late night. Our ruling Nicholas Mattiello said that "by 11 o'clock 95 to 98 percent of the business was done. So we really didn't have that late-night session. We were just holding on one bill." It's true that one issue -- Newport Grand and its associated bills -- was holding things up on the last night of the session. It's much less true that 95 percent of the business was done by 11 p.m. And Mattiello's suggestion that you shouldn't call a 4 a.m. adjournment a late-night session simply because most votes involved legislation that members had seen before strikes us as Pants On Fire ridiculous. His statement contains just enough truth -- the fact that one bill was at issue -- to escape having his slacks scorched. We rule it False.

pomt-12990	"In Austin, Texas, the average homeowner is paying about $1,300 to $1,400 just for recapture," meaning funds spent in non-Austin school districts.	true	/texas/statements/2016/dec/16/kirk-watson/kirk-watson-says-average-austin-homeowner-pays-130/	For years, Austin taxpayers have indirectly helped fund schools elsewhere in accord with the state’s more than 20-year-old system for equalizing aid among school districts, some of which have vast differences in taxable property wealth. Kirk Watson, the Democratic state senator from Travis County, attached an ear-catching figure to those costs during a November 2016 Texas Tribune panel discussion about hot issues in the 2017 legislative session. "In Austin, Texas," Watson said, "the average homeowner is paying about $1,300 to $1,400 just for recapture," as in funds shifted to less property-rich districts elsewhere. "And so that’s going to the state to fund state obligations. We have got to look at how we’re doing our school finance system so that we can do right by the people in this state and have a fair and equitable system." We asked Watson’s office how he arrived at his figure for how much average Austin homeowners are paying to schools elsewhere. By email, Kate Alexander said Watson relied on September 2016 testimony by the Austin school district’s chief financial officer. According to Nicole Conley's prepared remarks for a Sept. 28, 2016, appearance at a joint hearing of the Texas House committees on appropriations and public education, Conley described the Austin school district as the state’s largest single payer of recapture. "Our payment alone comprises 13 percent of all state collections," Conley’s testimony says. "During the next five years—between fiscal years 2016 and 2020—Austin ISD is projected to pay almost $2.6 billion in recapture payments to the state. By 2019, more than half of every tax dollar collected in Austin will go to the state." Later in her testimony: Conley said: "So to put it in perspective, we could lower our tax rate by 35 cents if we weren’t sending $406 million to the state under the recapture system. For the average homeowner in Austin, that would amount to about $1,400 in lower taxes. That’s fairly substantial; that’s pretty significant tax relief. That would certainly make Austin more affordable for some of our taxpayers." To our inquiry, district spokesman Jacob Barrett told us Conley reached her savings figure for the average homeowner starting from the district’s 2016-17 budget indicating it expects to pay $406 million in recapture to the state in accord with the school funding system. That payment amounts to 38 percent of the district’s $1.061 billion in budgeted property taxes, Barrett noted. Barrett said the district got to the average homeowner’s share of the budgeted recapture payment starting from its average taxable value of a home in the district of $328,844 (as of June 2016) on which such an owner expected to pay $3,548 in school maintenance and operations property taxes at the M&O tax rate of $1.079 per $100 valuation. Finally, Barrett said, multiplying the 38 percent by that $3,548 delivers the portion of taxes on an average-value residence that goes to recapture of $1,355. Barrett also emailed us a December 2012 district document showing that by amount, the Austin district's 2015 recapture payment was followed by what was paid by the Highland Park (Dallas); Eanes; Cotulla; and Karnes City districts, respectively. Also, the document says, the Austin district’s annual recapture payment is projected to exceed $630 million in 2019 when "more than half of every school property tax dollar collected locally will be ‘recaptured’ by the state." Next, we asked non-district experts--Joe Wisnoski, a former Texas Education Agency official; Tom Canby of the Texas Association of School Business Officials; and Christy Rome, who advocates for districts required to make recapture payments--to evaluate how the Austin district determined the average Austin homeowner will pay $1,355 in school property taxes toward the district’s 2016-17 recapture total. Solid, each expert said. By email, Wisnoski cautioned though: "The average doesn’t really describe much about the distribution of payment amounts, so you don’t really know how many taxpayers are clustered close to that amount, and how many are really far away (high or low) compared to the average." Finally, we looked into how much a district resident with the median value home might be paying toward its recapture total. For that, we ran the median value of homes in the Austin district as of Aug. 8, 2016--$261,487--through the district’s equation. Result: The median-value homeowner will be expected to pay $2,821 in M&O school taxes, of which $1,078 would be her or his share of the district’s recapture payment. Barrett, the district spokesman, didn’t question our math. He noted, though, that Watson referred to "the average homeowner." It’s fair, Barrett said by email, "to use the variable that we do." Our ruling Watson said the average Austin homeowner pays about $1,300 to $1,400 just for recapture, as in funds ultimately spent in other districts. By the Austin district’s analysis, the owners of a home at the district’s average taxable value for 2016-17 stands to pay $1,355 in school property taxes toward the district’s more than $400 million recapture payment for the year.

pomt-05534	President Barack Obama "has doubled the size of government since he took office."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/10/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-barack-obama-has-doubled-size-government/	On his congressional website, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., makes a striking claim that President Obama has doubled the size of goverment. Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, is perhaps the leading Republican voice for a fiscally conservative approach to taxing, spending and reducing the federal debt. So when a reader recently pointed out the doubling-government claim on a web page devoted to Ryan’s views on tax policy, we thought it was worth a look. Here’s an excerpt from the Web page: "At a time when Wisconsinites are facing economic uncertainty, a high unemployment rate and a rise in the costs of living, the last thing our country needs are tax increases. President Obama, however, has proposed $1.6 trillion in new taxes on families, small businesses and job creators and tripling the debt since he was elected. At the same time, the president has doubled the size of government since he took office. Instead of chasing higher spending with ever-higher taxes, Congress needs to make our tax code fair, competitive and simple. Unfortunately, our current tax system fails on these three elements." Further down the page, Ryan adds a bit more detail about his doubling-government claim. "Strong leadership is needed in the White House, but despite repeated acknowledgments of the gravity of the federal government’s fiscal outlook, the president seems to have ignored the warnings of his own experts and punted on the (fiscal year) 2012 budget. The budget proposal he submitted to Congress last year continues down the same unsustainable path: doubling the size of government since the President took office, imposing $1.6 trillion in new taxes on families, small businesses and job creators and tripling the debt since the President was elected. This crushing burden of debt is holding back economic growth. President Obama’s budget was defeated by a vote of 0 to 97 in the Senate. We have tried to borrow, spend,and tax our way to prosperity, and it hasn’t worked. The President is expected to put forward his budget proposal for (fiscal year) 2013 in the near future. I remain hopeful that he will work with Congress to address these important challenges facing our country." According to the second passage above, Ryan is referring to Obama’s fiscal year 2012 budget proposal -- the one released in early 2011, rather than the current one, which was released in early 2012. So we’ll focus on Obama’s fiscal year 2012 proposal. We didn’t hear back from Ryan’s office, but we think the most obvious way to interpret his statement is by measuring the size of federal outlays -- that is, the money spent by the federal government. Ryan is, after all, talking about budget figures. First, let’s look at the amount of federal outlays when Obama "took office." According to the Office of Management and Budget, federal outlays for fiscal year 2009 -- the fiscal year that was underway when Obama was inaugurated -- totaled $3.5 trillion. To look at federal outlays for subsequent years, we turned to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress. The numbers are broadly similar to OMB’s, but since CBO is an independent agency, rather than part of the Obama administration, budget experts suggested that we use CBO’s numbers instead. CBO concluded that by fiscal year 2012 -- the current fiscal year -- the president’s budget proposal would increase federal outlays to $3.7 trillion. That’s a 6 percent increase -- a far cry from doubling. If you take a longer time horizon, the outlays come closer to doubling, but still not close. By fiscal year 2021 -- the final year for which CBO provided its analysis and long after Obama will have left office -- federal outlays would reach $5.8 trillion. That’s an increase of 66 percent, which is still not double. However, even if that figure truly represented a doubling, using the 2021 figure is misleading. When Ryan said that Obama "has doubled the size of government since he took office," it sounds like he’s saying Obama has already doubled the size of government -- not that his spending blueprint will lead to doubled federal outlays at a point five years after Obama’s theoretical second term in office will have come to an end. "I think it is pretty clear" that Ryan’s claim "in a straight budget sense is false, because it implies it has already happened," said Steve Ellis, the vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. Just to be sure, we also looked at the figures for federal outlays as a percentage of gross domestic product. These numbers actually decline from 25.0 percent in fiscal 2009 to 23.6 percent in fiscal 2012, and then moves within a narrow range, ending up at 24.2 percent in fiscal 2021. No doubling here, either. Finally, there’s the question of whether Obama would be to blame even if the doubling claim was true. Roy T. Meyers, a political scientist at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County who specializes in budget issues, is skeptical "Were all the increased outlays because of Obama's actions? Of course not," Meyers said. "Many of them were the result of ‘mandatory’ policies in place before he took office, and those policies responded to unfavorable economic conditions -- deposit insurance, food stamps, Medicaid, unemployment insurance and so on." Indeed, discretionary spending -- the line items that Obama had the most control over when he assembled his budget -- represented between 25 and 40 percent of federal outlays during most of the 10 year period that CBO studied. The rest -- a clear majority -- consists of mandatory spending and net interest on the federal debt. Finally, while we doubted this is what Ryan meant, we also looked at whether the number of federal employees had doubled under Obama. Federal employment has never risen by more than 10 percent above its January 2009 level, excluding temporary Census jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And there is no reliable statistical way to measure changes in the federal government's regulatory burden, said Stan Collender, a former staff member of the House and Senate Budget Committees, who is a partner at Qorvis, a public relations firm. Our ruling Even Ryan’s out-of-date budget data offers no support for the notion that Obama "has doubled the size of government since he took office." As the House's budget leader and a key spokesman for his party’s budgetary proposals, Ryan should have known better. We rate his statement Pants on Fire. UPDATE: After our story appeared, Ryan’s office got back to us. They said that they had been using fiscal year 2008 as their base year, rather than fiscal year 2009. Using the 2008 figures, federal outlays do roughly double between 2008 and 2021 under Obama’s fiscal year 2012 budget proposal. However, we think it’s inaccurate to use fiscal 2008 as the base year, since that year ended about four months before Obama took office. In any case, our previous concerns -- using figures for 2021, when Obama will have been out of office for either five or nine years, and ignoring the role of mandatory spending in expanding federal outlays -- still stand, and we’re keeping the rating at Pants on Fire. In addition, Ryan’s office removed the sentence we checked after our story appeared. It has been replaced by a sentence that reads, "At the same time, the president will double the national debt and his plan ensures it will triple in the next eight years."

pomt-03458	If Gov. Rick Scott activates "the National Guard in anticipation of a federal disaster, the state’s costs, including the costs to recall any furloughed guardsmen, will be fully reimbursable by FEMA."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/jun/18/bill-nelson/bill-nelson-says-fema-will-fully-reimburse-florida/	Republican Gov. Rick Scott and Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson recently sparred about the impact of sequestration on the Florida National Guard. Tropical Storm Andrea’s arrival in early June prompted Scott to write Nelson and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, urging them to work with the Department of Defense to spare civilian guard employees from pay cuts as a result of the automatic spending cuts agreed to by President Barack Obama and Congress. About 1,000 employees of the Florida National Guard must take a furlough day each week starting July 8 to Sept. 30, the end of the federal budget year. The support employees repair planes and vehicles, provide medical services and handle duties such as public affairs and human relations. "These forced cuts to guardsmen not only immediately result in lost income for Florida guard families, they also force the state to spend state tax dollars to make up for days of emergency functions, which could have been avoided if not for the Department of Defense cuts," Scott said. Rubio told a Gannett reporter there wasn’t much he could do to avoid the sequester without raising taxes. Nelson responded with his own letter, saying it was too late to redo the cuts with just four months left in the fiscal year. Nelson said he consulted the legal team of the Federal Emergency Management Administration about Scott’s concerns. "Regarding your concern about increased costs to the state, let me share with you what I have received from the legal office of FEMA Director Craig Fugate. If you as governor activate the National Guard in anticipation of a federal disaster, the state’s costs, including the costs to recall any furloughed guardsmen, will be fully reimbursable by FEMA," Nelson wrote. Nelson then quoted from FEMA, which said that "under a Presidential disaster declaration, FEMA reimburses the State (Grantee), subject to the State cost-share, for costs in excess of those incurred for weekend drills and annual training and other non-disaster related activations." Scott wasn’t satisfied with Nelson’s response (saying nothing of Rubio’s). He enlisted his top emergency management official to write Nelson, saying his claim that the "state’s costs, including the costs to recall any furloughed guardsmen, will be fully reimbursable by FEMA," runs counter to recent history. We wanted to look at Nelson’s claim since the Scott administration deemed it factually problematic. Let’s say a potentially crazy storm is heading to Florida. What’s a governor to do? In order for FEMA to be involved, Scott must declare a state of emergency. If the situation is more than local and state resources can handle, the governor then requests the president issue an emergency declaration. FEMA reviews the request and makes a recommendation to the president. FEMA has limitations on what it can do for a state without a presidential declaration. "One of those is, it’s not going to pay the guard," said Ernest Abbott, who served as FEMA’s general counsel during President Bill Clinton’s second term. Now he runs a private practice specializing in FEMA law. Presidential emergency declarations are made ahead of a threat, such as prior to a hurricane’s landfall. Florida has had 12. They are meant to supplement local and state efforts for some activities, such as evacuations. Disaster declarations, of which Florida has had 65, are issued by the president after a catastrophic event, usually per the governor’s request. If the president makes a declaration, FEMA then decides which area is eligible for federal relief and which programs are appropriate. The federal share of assistance is always at least 75 percent, according to FEMA. That’s been the norm for Florida in recent years. Florida has not received 100 percent reimbursement for a major disaster declaration since 2005, when FEMA covered expenses for hurricanes Wilma, Dennis and Katrina, according to the state Division of Emergency Management. For the state’s nine disasters since 2007, the federal government paid between 75 and 80 percent, according to the Florida Division of Emergency Management. That includes severe storms and tornadoes in 2007, two days of damage for Tropical Storm Fay in 2008, Hurricanes Ike and Gustav in 2008, flooding in north Florida in 2009, and Tropical Storm Debby and Hurricane Isaac in 2012. Even though the feds paid for most of the costs, they did not pay for all of them. There is a possibility FEMA could pick up the entire tab for debris removal and emergency protective work for a three-day period, which happened eight times during the state's busy hurricane seasons in 2004 and 2005. FEMA’s legal team assured Nelson that recalling furloughed workers for an emergency would be subject to the federal and state cost-sharing, according to his letter to Scott. But the Scott administration said much is unknown because the sequester is such a new animal. "Will FEMA reimburse us for two additional days? We don’t know what’s going to happen," said Glenn Sutphin, legislative affairs director for the Florida Department of Military Affairs. FEMA told us what it told Nelson, that it reimburses a state at a cost-share for emergency work done on top of non-disaster activities like annual training and weekend drills (so long as a declaration is issued). The problem is: Nelson didn’t say it that precisely in his letter. He said the state’s National Guard expenses would be "fully reimbursable." Fully, to us and the dictionary,means completely. But that’s not a sure thing. Florida is not guaranteed a federal reimbursement of any amount if Scott activates the National Guard ahead of a storm. He needs a presidential declaration. Further, the reimbursement is rarely full; the federal government most often shares 75 percent of the costs. We rate Nelson’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-11048	Says proposal to use city-owned land for an Austin pro soccer stadium is a "$1 billion giveaway."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2018/jun/27/austin-better-future/claim-austin-soccer-plan-1-billion-givewaway-targe/	It’s an alarming contention: The Austin City Council is poised to "give" more than $1 billion to a private company and receive nothing in return as it seeks to lure a Major League Soccer team. The anti-stadium political action committee making the claim of a "$1 billion giveaway" — called Austin for a Better Future — drives home the enormity of the sum in an internet video by conjuring a wish list of alternative uses for the money. By Wednesday afternoon, the video had been viewed more than 20,000 times. "Imagine what else we could do with another billion dollars to make our city even better," intones the video’s youthful-looking narrator. He raises the prospect of using the money to instead fund annual pay raises for Austin school teachers, "full-ride scholarships" to the University of Texas for every local high school graduate, or newly built homes "for every single homeless person in the city of Austin." Setting aside that no formal proposals exist to spend $1 billion on any of those items, we were curious whether it’s accurate to say the City Council will be handing such an amount to a private company and getting nothing in return if it approves the agreement for the soccer stadium as it currently is formulated? A representative of the anti-stadium group contacted by PolitiFact Texas said the $1 billion figure is based on simple math and actually is conservative. But two professors who study publicly funded economic incentives said the group’s analysis is off base, with one calling the $1 billion amount that the group came up with "crazy" and the other saying it "doesn’t pass the sniff test." Under the stadium proposal — on which the City Council is slated to take some key initial votes Thursday — the city-owned McKalla Place tract near the Domain in North Austin would be leased to Precourt Sports Ventures for $1 a year. Precourt, a Major League Soccer team owner, would then privately finance and build what it has estimated would be a $200 million stadium at the site. The city would own the land and the stadium, so Precourt wouldn’t pay any property taxes on the facility. The initial lease would last for 20 years, with three options for Precourt to renew it under the same terms. The anti-stadium group, which initially answered questions from PolitiFact Texas through e-mail but didn’t respond to a follow-up request for a phone interview, said it arrived at the "$1 billion giveaway" figure by first calculating the estimated property taxes that would be owed by Precourt if it owned the land, instead of leasing it from the city, and also made $250 million worth of improvements on it, which the anti-stadium group pegged as the value of the soccer stadium. The group then took that figure, based on 2017 property tax rates, and multiplied it by 80 years — the maximum term of the proposed lease, assuming all options were exercised. It also assumed 2.5 percent annual growth in local property values, arriving at its $1 billion-plus total. But Clint Peinhardt, a University of Texas at Dallas political science professor, said such an analysis has many holes, not the least of which is that 80 years is simply too long a time period to forecast accurately. Who knows, for instance, if soccer will even be played in 80 years, or if it will become so huge in the United States that it tops football in terms of a loyal fan base. What’s more, the anti-stadium group’s analysis doesn’t factor in depreciation, which would have a major impact on the value of the facility and the tax calculation. Or the possibility that the lease would not be renewed by the soccer team’s ownership. Or the potential for something even more outlandish — such as a meteor destroying the site and rendering the entire exercise moot. "Anything that far out in the future — 80 years — is a pretty crazy thing to try to guess," Peinhardt said. "In general, that is just a huge time frame." As a result, Peinhardt and Nathan Jensen, a University of Texas at Austin professor of government, said it’s too much of a leap of logic to simply add up the value of property taxes that wouldn’t be due for decades and then contend city leaders are "giving them away" in the present if they approve the stadium plan. They said the "time value of money" — whereby a dollar today is worth much more than a theoretical dollar in the future — just doesn’t work that way. The pair also noted that the anti-stadium group’s analysis assumes no benefits to the city — in terms of jobs, tourism or nearby development — to offset the purported $1 billion cost to taxpayers. While taxpayer incentives for a soccer stadium might not be the most "revenue-maximizing" path for the city to choose for the McKalla site — particularly since other plans recently have been proposed for the tract — they said the potential positives should be considered along with the negatives. There is also the detail that, as currently proposed, the city would still own the stadium outright if the team’s ownership didn’t renew the deal. Jensen described himself as a critic of the current stadium plan, but he nonetheless dismissed the anti-stadium group’s number, saying it isn’t "a credible calculation" or a serious fiscal analysis. Our ruling A video by an anti-stadium group claims the Austin City Council is poised to give more than $1 billion to a private company and receive nothing in return. While the City Council could potentially provide incentives worth millions of dollars as part of the soccer stadium deal, the scary "$1 billion giveaway" language of the video simply doesn’t stand up to close scrutiny. The lengthy time frame invoked and the countless unknown events that could impact the deal make the math used in the video meaningless. Factor in that the video also doesn’t account for any return on the city’s investment, and it is clear that the contentions are off base — and ridiculous. We rate the claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-05605	Says U.S. Rep. Connie Mack "took seven and a half years to finish college."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/mar/28/george-lemieux/lemieux-says-congressman-mack-took-7-12-years-fini/	George LeMieux depicts Florida Republican U.S. Senate rival Connie Mack as a man who vaulted from college party boy to congressman. And those college days, well, they lasted awhile, according to LeMieux. In the Web ad "Two and a Half Macks" LeMieux says that "Connie the IV took seven and a half years to finish college," while showing a buffoonish-like Mack wearing a T-shirt that says "Kollege" and dancing around in front of a University of Florida sign. We’ve already checked other claims in the same February 2012 Web ad including that Mack "failed to pay his child support" (False) and whether his only job in the real world was an events coordinator for Hooters (Mostly False). In this item, we will explore how long it took Mack to finish college. Mack won a seat in the state House of Representatives, representing Broward and Palm Beach counties in 2000. He then moved to Southwest Florida and won a seat in Congress in 2004. LeMieux’s campaign directed us to a 2000 article in the Palm Beach Post, which detailed Mack’s route to his college degree: "Born Cornelius H. McGillicuddy, the younger Mack attended public high school in northern Virginia, transferring in the middle of his junior year to the Massanutten Military School in Woodstock, Va. "He left the military high school a year later in January 1986, lacking an English credit to graduate, and finished his high school requirement by enrolling that month at Sante Fe Community College in Gainesville. "He spent 2 1/2 years at the community college and transferred to the University of Florida in May 1988. He graduated from the university five years later, and three months shy of his 26th birthday, with a bachelor's degree in advertising." Subsequent news articles have repeated that it took Mack seven years, or seven and a half years, to finish college, including a 2012 Miami Herald article about Mack’s past. The Herald wrote about Mack’s time in college in connection to a legal case stemming from a 1992 bar brawl with professional baseball player Ron Gant. A jury found Gant started the fight but Mack didn’t win the legal damages or fees that he sought. The article stated that "Gant’s legal team sought to portray Mack as a troublemaking lightweight, noting he went to military school and that it took him more than seven years to get an advertising degree that, ultimately, he parlayed into a consultancy to promote Hooters, the Florida restaurant chain known for its scantily clad waitresses.’’ We contacted spokespersons for the two schools mentioned in the Palm Beach Post article. Known as Sante Fe Community College at the time (it’s now called Sante Fe College), Mack started in the spring term of 1986 and graduated in June 1988 with an associates of arts degree, said registrar Lynn Sullivan. That’s about two and a half years. Mack then transferred to the University of Florida in May 1988 and graduated in May 1993 with a bachelor’s of science degree in advertising, UF spokesman Stephen Orlando said. That’s about five years. So the math works. But there’s more to this story. We first asked about the overlap from May-June 1988, when Mack was technically a student at Sante Fe and UF. Orlando, the UF spokesman, said that it wasn’t unusual -- students can be admitted and register for classes with the presumption that they will earn the associate’s degree during that same semester -- in this case, the "summer A" semester of 1988. Then there’s the Post reference that Mack was finishing his high school requirements by enrolling in community college. Sullivan, the Sante Fe registrar, told us in an email that she couldn’t provide additional information. Mack campaign spokesman David James says the amount of time it took Mack to finish college depends on PolitiFact’s definition. For starters, Mack was dual-enrolled in high school and college in the spring of 1986 -- so the date he enrolled in community college overlaps technically with the time he would still be considered in high school. On top of that, James said, Mack took two years off from school -- 1991 and 1992 -- to work a full-time sales job. Mack finished school through correspondence classes, earning his diploma in 1993. That information -- at least the part about Mack being away from UF for 1991 and 1992 -- is corroborated through school records. Orlando said that Mack was at UF starting with the "summer A" session in May 1988. He continued at UF through the fall of 1990, records show. But Mack did not take classes in 1991 or 1992. He returned for the spring semester of 1993, taking a couple of courses that were not on campus. That means Mack was taking classes at or through UF for about three years, not five. Our ruling The claim here is that Mack "took seven and a half years to finish college." There’s a kernel of truth to that statement. Mack enrolled at Sante Fe Community College in 1986 and graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor’s degree about seven and a half years later in 1993. But UF records show that Mack did not take classes for two of those years, 1991 and 1992. There’s also a minor point that Mack says he was dual-enrolled in community college at the same time he was completing his high school degree. Those, to us, are critical facts that would give someone seeing the ad a much different impression of Mack’s college career -- which fits our definition of Mostly False.

pomt-10214	John McCain "took on the drug industry."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/09/john-mccain/he-butted-heads-with-big-pharma/	Next to Big Oil, few businesses make more convenient political punching bags than drug companies. Anecdotes about cash-strapped seniors cutting their pills in half or crossing the border to Canada or Mexico to fill prescriptions have provided red meat for campaigns at the national and local levels. Now John McCain's campaign is joining in. An ad unveiled Sept. 8, 2008, portrays McCain and running mate Sarah Palin as mavericks willing to take on all comers. Over still photos of the pair, an announcer describes how each stood up to members of their own party and enumerates various reform efforts. A few — "He fights pork barrel spending" ( We found a few blips on the record), "She stopped the 'Bridge to Nowhere,' " (She didn't kill it, she performed last rites), "She Took on Big Oil" (Yes, she did), — we've ruled on previously. One claim was new: "He took on the drug industry." We wondered if McCain really did battle Big Pharma. Though he isn't often associated with health care issues, McCain sounded a bit like Hillary Rodham Clinton last year when he assailed drugmakers for profiteering. He even took a swat at the industry during a Jan. 5 Republican debate in New Hampshire, when Mitt Romney defended drugmakers against criticism by other GOP presidential aspirants, by saying, "Don't turn this pharmaceutical manufacturers into the big bad guys," and McCain interjected, "Well, they are." In the Senate, McCain has backed up that belief by pushing legislation to liberalize drug importation and expand the availability of lower-cost generic drugs, each of which would cut into name-brand pharmaceutical manufacturers' profits — and that prompted strenuous opposition from the companies. Each of the efforts also involved working across the aisle with Democrats. In 2001, for example, McCain and Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., collaborated on legislation that would have rewritten patent law to make it more difficult for brand-name drugmakers to stave off competition from generic versions once their original patents have expired. The measure came at a time of mounting public criticism over drug prices but triggered strong resistance from mostly Republican critics, who said the effort would discourage research spending by big drug manufacturers. McCain and Schumer's measure passed the Senate by a 78-21 margin in 2002 but was never taken up by the House. The Bush administration eventually confronted the ongoing buzz about drug pricing by proposing a Food and Drug Administration rule to shorten the time that brand-name drugmakers can market drugs without competition from cheaper generic competitors. In 2003, McCain again went against the wishes of drugmakers by opposing a sweeping Medicare package that created first-time outpatient prescription drug coverage for seniors. McCain objected to the costs associated with providing coverage to each of the program's more than 40-million beneficiaries, and had he and like-minded lawmakers prevailed, coverage likely would have been limited to lower-income populations. In 2004, McCain waded into another sensitive issue for the drug industry, when he joined with the likes of Sens. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Byron L. Dorgan, D-N.D., to push legislation that would allow prescription drugs to be imported from Canada, where price controls keep costs down. (The federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act bars drug importation except by the manufacturer and stipulates that the products can be dispensed only with a prescription). Like the generic drug bill, this measure also picked up substantial bipartisan support, along with the backing of seniors lobby AARP, but ran into resistance from the drug industry and Bush administration, which argued it could open the U.S. market to a flood of dangerous or counterfeit medicines. Senate Republican leaders — who controlled the chamber at the time and wanted to avoid sending President Bush a popular bill he might have to veto in the middle of an election campaign — didn't allow the measure to come up for a vote. Joe Antos, a health policy scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said McCain's legislative stands showed a clear willingness to confront the drug industry but added that they stem as much from the Arizona senator's broader concern about industries' potential to game government policies for profit as from any particular beef he has with drugmakers. Antos said a McCain administration probably would be less receptive to pharmaceutical industry entreaties for streamlined regulations or other favorable policies than the Bush administration has. "His natural skepticism would come right to the front," Antos said. Democrats contend that even while McCain was promoting politically appealing proposals to deal with drug costs, he was quietly doing the industry favors with respect to advertising regulations and how much it can charge government programs for its products. Barack Obama's campaign, in a rebuttal to the Sept. 8 ad, notes that during the 2003 debate on the Medicare drug benefit, McCain voted with the majority of the Senate against an amendment that would have required drugmakers to release advertising with balanced information or be subject to civil penalties. During the 2002 generic drug debate, McCain voted against an amendment that was adopted by the Senate that allowed states to use their volume purchasing power to buy lower-priced drugs for uninsured people who don't qualify for Medicaid. And in 1995, he voted against offering drug discounts to state Medicaid programs and public health facilities during a debate on balanced-budget legislation. These votes might indeed have helped the drug industry at crucial times. But they were on narrow amendments to broader bills and are not as significant as McCain's stands on importation and generics, which prompted stiff resistance from big, name-brand drug companies and their allies in Congress. McCain can rightly claim that he confronted drug companies on sensitive issues that affected its bottom line. For this reason, we rule his statement Mostly True.

pomt-08661	John Boehner has called for "repealing the rest of the stimulus, which would raise taxes on 110 million middle class people."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/13/austan-goolsbee/austan-goolsbee-says-boehner-wants-repeal-stimulus/	On ABC's This Week on Sept. 12, 2010, Austan Goolsbee, the new chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, picked up on President Barack Obama's recent attacks on House Republican Leader John Boehner. "I would point out that Representative Boehner has a different view and is calling for repealing the rest of the stimulus, which would raise taxes on 110 million middle class people," Goolsbee said. That Boehner has called for a halt to stimulus spending is undisputed. The question is whether that means Boehner would put the kibosh on the Making Work Pay tax credits included in the economic stimulus package that passed in early 2009. The tax credits came to $400 for working individuals, $800 per couple, per year in 2009 and 2010. It was estimated to benefit about 110 million Americans. We asked Boehner's spokesman Michael Steel about Goolsbee's statement. "That is not correct," Steel wrote in an e-mail. "The savings we outline from cancelling unspent stimulus funds does not include Making Work Pay." We can see where the confusion arose. In his public statements about stopping stimulus spending, Boehner hasn't been particularly clear on the point. For example, in February 2010, Boehner released a statement calling on the Obama administration to start cutting spending immediately, and "that can begin by repealing spending from the stimulus." He doesn't make clear if he is leaving out the tax credits. More recently, when David Gregory questioned Boehner in an NBC Meet the Press interview on Aug. 8, 2010, about how Republicans would offset the cost of extending all of the Bush tax cuts, as they have proposed, Boehner responded, "Why don't we stop the stimulus spending? ... Why don't we stop it. It's not working." Making Work Tay tax credits are stimulus spending. And while they are set to expire in just a few months (the end of 2010), in theory, the government could cut them off tomorrow. But we think Steel has credible evidence to support the claim that Boehner's call to repeal stimulus spending did not extend to Making Work Pay. His previous comments have focused entirely on the stimulus spending programs, not the tax cuts. For example, in the Meet the Press interview, Boehner voiced support for spending cuts outlined by Republican Reps. Paul Ryan and Jeb Hensarling -- which suggested there was $266 billion in unspent stimulus that could be redirected to pay down the deficit. In a previous item, we looked into the claim that there was really that much "unspent" stimulus, and concluded there was actually much less, even if you included money from Making Work Pay that the government hasn't yet paid out. More importantly, though, the plan from the Republican caucus of the Commitee on the Budget to "Cancel remaining 'stimulus' funds" specifically references H.R. 3140, introduced by Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga. Price's bill targets "unspent stimulus," and the legislative language makes clear that the stimulus package's tax sections -- including the Making Work Pay tax credit -- would not be impacted. According to a section by section summary of the bill from the Republican Study Committee, Price's bill "rescinds or repeals all of the spending in the 'stimulus' excepting only the tax provisions and the unemployment benefits." Press releases issued from legislative co-sponsors of the bill also note that the tax provisions of the stimulus would not be impacted. There are some political games being played by both sides here, of course. Republicans like Boehner want to attack the stimulus without acknowledging that it included tax relief (an idea Republicans traditionally support). And Democrats want to remind that it does. But in this case, we think Goolsbee is overreaching to make his point. Yes, Boehner and other Republicans have talked about putting a halt to all unspent stimulus -- and without being more specific, one might wonder if that includes money not yet spent on tax credits. But when you dig into the nitty-gritty of the Republicans' plan, it specifically notes that it does not include repeal of Making Work Pay. And so we rule Goolsbee's claim False.

pomt-07411	"We have created more jobs in this last year than the Bush administration (did) in eight years."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/apr/28/joe-biden/vice-president-joe-biden-says-there-were-more-new-/	Vice President Joe Biden loves campaigning in Ohio. He did so 15 times during the 2010 Midterm elections for various state and federal candidates. But Democrats still suffered a "shellacking," he joked during an April 19 campaign fundraiser in Cleveland for U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, who faces re-election next year. Citing positive economic news, Biden insisted, however, that the political debate about his administration’s policies now favors Democrats. "A lot of things we took a shellacking for, the American public has had an opportunity to take a good look at now," he said. Biden noted the improving unemployment rate. And he added this comparison: "We have created more jobs in this last year than the Bush administration (did) in eight years. We are in a position where we are moving to toward creating an average of 220,000 jobs a month. Not enough, but we are moving." PolitiFact Ohio likes comparisons and decided to examine this one because it’s emerging as a key Democratic talking point. When checking out job figures, PolitiFact turns to The Bureau of Labor Statistics, the official score keeper of U.S. employment numbers. The BLS numbers are based on monthly surveys of employers. It updates the monthly figure as employers complete their surveys and it incorporates into the monthly figure a more complete quarterly census of employment and wages. First, we can quickly dispense with the Biden’s lead-in: That the unemployment rate is improving. In March, the national unemployment rate dropped for the fourth consecutive month. At 8.8 percent, the rate is down from a recession peak of 10.1 in Oct. 2009, according to the BLS. Also, we can dispense with the last part: "We are moving to toward creating an average of 220,000 jobs a month. Not enough, but we are moving." Since it’s not really a statement of fact and includes a prediction, we’ll leave that to be examined down the road. But how about the Obama vs. Bush job comparison? The number of jobs as of February 2001, the first full month of Bush’s presidency, was 132.53 million. The number of jobs as of January 2009, the month he left office, was 133.56 million. That’s a net gain 1.03 million jobs. To checkout Biden’s claim, we looked back 12 months, from March 2010 to March of 2011. (Though Biden made remarks this month, April figures have not yet been tallied.) The number of jobs in March 2010 was 129.43 million. The number of jobs in March 2011 is 130.73 million. The net gain during the last year is 1.3 million jobs. That means 270,000 more jobs were created in the last 12 months than the net total of jobs at the end of Bush’s two terms. A familiar detour, or caveat, is in order. Typically, the most recent BLS monthly job figures are preliminary and will change as surveys are completed and figures are updated. That means the 270,000 edge for the Obama administration could increase -- or disappear. Politifact also frequently points that when framing job figures, slicing and timing make all the difference. Republicans, for instance, like to frame the jobs story this way: The U.S. has lost a total of 2.09 million jobs since Obama’s first full-month in office in February 2009. That’s true. Of course, looking at this way shortchanges the impact of the deep recession Obama inherited and the recent economic growth. Likewise, Democrats shortchange Bush when they ignore that the U.S. created more than 5.6 million jobs through January 2008, when the recession began to take hold. The bottom line is that the recession, which officially began in Dec. 2007, hurt the job record of both presidents. So where does that leave Biden’s statement? He’s correct about the declining unemployment rate. He’s also accurate about the gains made in the last year. The figure also falls within the context that the recovery has been slow and painful but the job picture is improving of late, albeit slowly. Understanding how he slices job numbers in his comparison is a point that provides clarification. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Biden’s statement as Mostly True.

pomt-10504	"(Obama) did accept donations from lobbyists and PACs and he spent money in this campaign from that, through his political action committee."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/27/bill-clinton/a-small-amount-before-he-announced/	In a March 16, 2008, interview with a group of college journalists, the mtvU editorial board, former President Bill Clinton was asked why Sen. Hillary Clinton had not made a pledge not to accept campaign contributions from lobbyists, as Sen. Barack Obama has. "He (Obama) did accept donations from lobbyists and PACs and he spent money in this campaign from that, through his political action committee," Bill Clinton said. "He said one thing and did another." Clinton is talking here about Obama's leadership PAC, Hopefund. Leadership PACs are political action committees established by members of Congress to support other candidates. All the other presidential candidates shut down their leadership PACs when they announced their candidacy, but Obama's PAC continued to distribute more than $400,000 to political candidates and parties after Obama entered the ring on Feb. 10, 2007. "And this money did come from lobbyists and special interest groups," Clinton said. Clinton is right, but some scale is in order. According to an analysis for PolitiFact by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, of the $4.5-million raised by Obama's Hopefund, $16,500 came from lobbyists, and $125,000 from political action committees such as Lockheed Martin Employees' PAC, AT&T; Corp. PAC and Walt Disney Productions Employees. The biggest donors were lawyers and law firms, accounting for nearly a half-million dollars. So Obama's leadership PAC did raise money from lobbyists and PACs, though it amounted to just a fraction of the total fundraising. Also notable is that the money was collected before Obama announced his presidential candidacy, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. PolitiFact has already weighed in on Obama's campaign pledge not to take money from lobbyists or PACs, finding that while he has eschewed money from federally registered lobbyists, he has accepted thousands from people who work for lobbying firms. We have also noted that Hillary Clinton has raised more campaign donations from registered lobbyists than any other candidate. Common sense suggests the distributions to candidates were meant to advance Obama's campaign, particularly when almost 43 percent of the money was spent on candidates in states with early primaries. (See our related ruling on this point here). One question is whether Obama's Hopefund distributions violate Obama's pledge not to accept lobbyist or PAC money in his run for president. Because the contributions were made prior to the start of his campaign, we find they do not. Therefore it's a stretch for Clinton to say, "He said one thing and did another." But we're checking Clinton's claim that "(Obama) did accept donations from lobbyists and PACs and he spent money in this campaign from that, through his political action committee." And Obama's leadership PAC did accept $16,000 from lobbyists, and another $125,000 from PACs, even though it was collected before Obama was an announced candidate. And nearly half of Hopefund's money was spent on key primary states during the campaign. So we rate Clinton's claim True.

pomt-14316	"We have not taken away any rights that have currently existed in any city in North Carolina" with the passage of HB2.	false	/north-carolina/statements/2016/mar/30/pat-mccrory/pat-mccrory-wrong-when-he-says-north-carolinas-new/	Ever since North Carolina passed a new state law banning cities and counties from enacting their own ordinances on discrimination laws, minimum wages and more, Republican leaders have been on the defensive in the face of national attention. A major talking point has been that, even despite the new law, nothing has actually changed. Gov. Pat McCrory has said as much in person as well as in written statements. Other GOP leaders who supported the bill have done the same. "We have not taken away any rights that have currently existed in any city in North Carolina, from Raleigh to Durham to Chapel Hill to Charlotte," McCrory said at a press conference Monday. "Every city and every corporation has the exact same discrimination policy this week as they had two weeks ago." We’re going to focus specifically on the claim about cities. When asked about it at that press conference Monday, McCrory said he was blindsided by the question and couldn’t answer it. The reporter had asked, specifically, about the status of a housing discrimination ordinance in Greensboro and a policy in Raleigh that said any contractors who wanted to do business with the local government needed to have policies forbidding discrimination against gay or transgender people. Carrboro also has a similar policy for contractors. A spokesman for the governor later said local housing ordinances wouldn’t be affected, citing a part of the bill that exempts "any private club or other establishment not, in fact, open to the public." But he had no answers about Carrboro and Raleigh on Monday. He didn’t respond to a follow-up email sent Wednesday. Another spokesman responded only to say he wasn’t the right person to ask. Perhaps that’s because the law does invalidate those ordinances. "He’s completely wrong about that, unfortunately," said Carrboro’s town attorney, Nick Herman, about McCrory’s claim that the law doesn’t take away any existing rights. Herman said the governor’s comments surprised him. Carrboro, for years, has had a policy that contractors paid by the town must have anti-discrimination policies that include sexual orientation or gender identity. And HB2 specifically says that local governments do not have the right to put any such requirements on contractors. "I was absolutely shocked to hear that the governor – I give him all presumption of good faith – but for him to claim this bill does not change existing law means he is not being adequately advised," Herman said. More towns and counties around the state also had in-house anti-discrimination policies that protected local government employees on the basis of sexual orientation and/or gender identity. McCrory has also said those won’t go away, although some of the officials in those municipalities say they’re skeptical. We interviewed three law professors about it; two disagreed with McCrory and one agreed with him. No more state claims for discrimination Taking a broader look at the law, it also took away a right that had previously been available to residents of any and every city in the state – the ability to file a state lawsuit over discriminatory firing. Such claims had been accepted by state courts since the 1980s, but they are no longer valid under HB2. "This Article does not create, and shall not be construed to create or support, a statutory or common law private right of action, and no person may bring any civil action based upon the public policy expressed herein," the law states. "This is a seismic issue," said Eric Doggett, a Raleigh lawyer who works in employment discrimination. "It’s huge. It’s a massive loss of rights, and it happened with almost no debate." Laura Noble, a Chapel Hill employment discrimination lawyer, agreed. "I won’t refer to this as a ‘bathroom bill’ because that's really not what it's about," she said. "It’s about the elimination of discrimination protections." The law does say people who believe they were fired for discriminatory reasons can still bring suits to the state executive branch’s Human Resource Commission. But Doggett said that group doesn’t have the ability to award damages, like the state courts did until last Wednesday. "There’s no remedy," he said. "They have no teeth. … If we state it's the public policy of this state not to discriminate on those bases, it doesn’t mean anything if we can't enforce it." Noble concurred, saying that no matter the state discrimination policy is now, it’s largely meaningless. "What's the point of having it on the books if there's no sanctions if someone violates it?" She said. People can still file federal discrimination lawsuits. However, both attorneys said federal courts have a much shorter statute of limitations than state courts – less than six months, compared to three years – which often stops plaintiffs from suing if they have a case but waited too long. Debbie Durban, a corporate attorney with Nelson Mullins who practices in North and South Carolina, has experience defending businesses from discrimination claims. She also said her understanding of the bill is that it takes away state lawsuits, although she said most state claims eventually end up at the federal level anyway. Our ruling McCrory said that with the passage of HB2, "we have not taken away any rights that have currently existed in any city in North Carolina." That is not true. It took away the rights of cities to put certain anti-discrimination requirements on private contractors, and it nullified existing policies like in Carrboro and Raleigh. It might have also taken away the rights of cities and counties to pass their own in-house anti-discrimination policies, depending on which lawyer you ask. And it takes away the right of everyone in North Carolina to file a state-level lawsuit alleging a discriminatory firing, according to attorneys who represent both employers and employees in those cases. But even if you discount the discrimination lawsuit changes and only focus on municipal government powers and rights, McCrory is still wrong. We rate this claim False.

mpws-00006	The 2015 session will be remembered as the one when Gov. Mark Dayton and the Legislature couldn’t come to terms on education funding. Dayton vetoed the education bill. Dayton wants $150 million more in the K-12 education bill to support pre-kindergarten programs in public schools. Republicans and some DFLers say the additional $400 million they put into education should be enough. Most of it is going to the per pupil formula. It’s an issue that has pitted Dayton against members of his own party, and underscores a fundamental difference in how many Democrats and Republicans view the issue of early learning. Many on the right say that, in addition to giving schools more money across the board, extra cash should be invested in early learning scholarships for low-income students, which gives parents a choice in where their kids start their education. (The funding bill includes money for this program, too.) On the left, many believe that to level the playing field for all kids, early education should be free and offered universally in public schools. This week, PoliGraph looked at two essential arguments on either side of the debate. The impasse sets the Legislature up for a special session to renegotiate a deal before July 1, when the new fiscal year begins and the state’s education department would shut down without annual funding. Republicans say Minnesota’s school administrators oppose Dayton’s pre-K plan. Dayton’s proposed expansion would be voluntary and for only half the day. Some school superintendents do oppose the idea. For instance, the Association of Metropolitan School Districts, which represents schools in the Twin Cities area, said universal pre-kindergarten “is a worthy goal.” “But our school districts need time to secure the necessary classroom space and licensed staff, develop transportation plans, provide staff training, and be prepared to serve pre-kindergarten students with special needs,” wrote AMSD executive director Scott Croonquist in a letter to House Education Finance Chair Rep. Jenifer Loon, R-Eden Prairie earlier this month. Instead, Croonquist’s group supports more funding for the per pupil formula – which is what the bill sent to Dayton includes – and higher investments in the School Readiness program, which serves 3 and 4 year olds who are underprepared for kindergarten. Similar views are shared by the Minnesota School Boards Association, individual administrators across the state, and even Dayton’s Early Learning Council, which suggested some of the money should be invested in the early education scholarship program. The Minnesota Association of School Administrators has a more nuanced view on the issue. Executive Director Gary Amoroso said his group supports Dayton’s call for $150 million more. But it would like to see much of it added to the formula, with an undefined expansion of early childhood learning coming next. Amoroso said he doesn’t view the issue as a divide between Dayton and the superintendents. However, some superintendents do support Dayton’s proposal. They include Julia Espe, who is superintendent of Princeton’s Public Schools. She wrote in a letter to legislators that “universal pre-K for 4-year-olds will help us with our core mission–educating every single student… Why can’t we provide this strategy to close the achievement gap when the state has a surplus?” Espe’s views were echoed by superintendents in Bloomington, Maplewood and South St. Paul, among other places. Dayton says universal pre-kindergarten in public schools will help close the achievement gap. At the core of Dayton’s argument is that expanding pre-kindergarten to public schools will give all kids a better start in life. Dayton has cause for concern. Minnesota ranks last among 41 states when it comes to access to state pre-kindergarten programs and Minnesota ranks high when it comes to daycare and pre-kindergarten costs. And the state’s achievement gap between white students and students of color remains stubbornly wide. Meanwhile, there’s some consensus among early learning experts that students, regardless of race and economic background, who attend high quality pre-kindergarten do better in school and in life, said Milagros Nores, who is Associate Director of Research at the National Institute for Early Education Research. Nores added that the effects are even stronger for low-income, minority and dual language children. But Nores said learning can happen in a number of settings, not just public schools, and still be successful. “If the experience is high-quality, then it doesn’t matter where the child learns,” she said. Some states, including Georgia, have an all-public approach, and the outcomes are good. Other states use a combination of public and private programs, and children are successful there, too, Nores said. Minnesota falls into the latter category, with lower-income children accessing pre-K with state-funded scholarships. Dayton’s budget preserves that funding, but critics say more money should be dedicated to those programs. University of Minnesota professor and early childhood learning expert Arthur Reynolds agrees that quality trumps location. But Reynolds also pointed out that many of the factors associated with quality – such as teaching skills and curriculum – are often found in the public school setting. “Many of these features are more common in schools, especially teacher pay and certification, but private centers can also be very strong in these areas, sometimes stronger such as in [lower] group size,” Reynolds said. “There tends to be more variation in quality in private programs comparatively.” Reynolds also emphasized access, particularly when it comes to pre-K costs in Minnesota. “There has been greater reliance on private programs, family -based programs but the need to build a larger more unified system is real and that is what the Governor is proposing,” Reynold said. The Verdicts Figuring out how to better educate Minnesota’s children is a politically thorny and complicated issue. And while there’s some uncertainty about how widespread support is for Dayton’s plan and whether ultimately expanding pre-kindergarten to all public schools is entirely necessary, politicians on both sides of the issue are making sound and reasonable arguments based on plenty of facts. 	accurate	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2015/05/poligraph-arguing-for-and-against-public-pre-k/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: Arguing for and against public pre-K	May 22, 2015, 2:00 PM	None	['Minnesota', 'Mark_Dayton', 'Minneapolis–Saint_Paul', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Bloomington,_Indiana', 'University_of_Minnesota', 'Georgia_(U.S._state)', 'Minnesota_Democratic–Farmer–Labor_Party', 'Jenifer_Loon', 'Instituto_Nacional_General_José_Miguel_Carrera', 'Blind_Joe_Reynolds']
pomt-13798	"(Koch Industries) is among the worst in toxic air pollution in the entire United States ... and churns out more climate-changing greenhouse gases than oil giants Chevron, Shell and Valero."	mostly true	/nevada/statements/2016/jul/19/harry-reid/reid-right-claiming-kochs-produce-more-pollution-o/	Charles and David Koch might be two of the people happiest about Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid’s impending retirement. The Nevada Democrat’s undisguised disdain for the billionaire brothers’ bankrolling of conservative groups is well-documented, and Reid’s long crusade against the Kochs isn’t letting up as he nears retirement. Kicking off a coordinated effort to draw attention towards conservative-leaning nonprofits and climate change skeptics, Reid zeroed in on the Kochs and accused them of being worse polluters than major oil companies. "The company is among the worst in toxic air pollution in the entire United States," he said during a July 11 floor speech. "Koch Industries churns out more climate-changing greenhouse gases than oil giants Chevron, Shell and Valero." This isn’t the first time Reid has tried to connect the Kochs’ business operations with climate change, but we were curious to see which company has the worst environmental record. Measuring pollution Reached by email, a Reid spokesperson cited a 2014 Rolling Stone article detailing the history behind the Koch family’s "Toxic Empire," particularly a line stating "Koch's climate pollution ... outpaces oil giants including Valero, Chevron and Shell." Rolling Stone cites a corporate polluter study published by the University of Massachusetts, Amherst’s Political Economy Research Institute. The "Greenhouse 100 Polluters Index" ranks Koch Industries 22nd on its list of polluters, creating more than 28 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions in 2014. The survey puts them ahead of the oil companies mentioned by Reid — Chevron (32nd), Royal Dutch Shell (27th) and Valero (26th) all produced fewer emissions in 2014 than Koch Industries, according to the report. Pretty clear, right? Koch Industries spokesman Ken Spain says Reid makes an unfair comparison between Koch and companies in essentially different industries with fewer facilities. "It is misleading to compare Koch Industries — one of the largest and diversified manufacturers in the US — to much smaller companies," he said in a statement. "Koch operates more than 200 manufacturing sites that employ 60,000 people in the U.S. Therefore, it is only logical that our GHG emissions are greater than a company that has far fewer facilities." Koch lands somewhere in the middle compared to the oil giants mentioned by Reid in terms of total revenue and employees, though they do own more facilities than the other three. Spain does have a point that Koch is more involved in manufacturing and refining goods that actually extracting and selling fossil fuels. The corporation is ranked 13th on the "Toxic 100 Air Polluters" list due to the roughly 31 million pounds of toxic air releases reported by the facilities owned by the Kochs. But Koch Industries does have many more facilities than Shell, Chevron and Valero. Koch Industries’ sites actually emits millions more toxic air releases than the 12 companies ahead of them on the list, such as top polluters Dow Chemical and ExxonMobil. But the company ranks lower than those because the survey adjusts the rankings to include levels of toxicity in the pollution, not just the total amount. Still, out-ranking just 12 companies isn’t exactly an environmental badge of honor. The corporation has a long history of violating environmental rules. In 2000, the company was fined a record $30 million due to repeated violations of environmental law, including more than 300 oil spills in six states. Koch Petroleum and other major polluters also reached an accord with the EPA that same year over air pollution, agreeing to spend $80 million to reduce refinery emissions and pay a $4.5 million penalty in return for a "clean slate" from the EPA. Invista, a Koch-owned subsidy, agreed in 2009 to a $1.7 million penalty and promised to spend up to $500 million to fix more than 680 self-reported violations of EPA standards at 12 facilities owned by the subsidy. PolitiFact also rated Charles Koch’s comments about the corporation being a "model for other companies" in terms of environmental regulation Mostly False, largely due to the numerous environmental crimes committed by the company throughout the late ‘90s and early 2000s. But Koch appears to be turning the corner. Rolling Stone acknowledges that the company has improved its regulatory compliance over time, which in the words of Charles Koch required a "monumental undertaking to integrate compliance into every aspect of the company." In a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, Koch environmental director Sheryl Corrigan said the company had reduced air emissions at its refineries by 76 percent since 1997. They’ve also downsized their oil pipeline business from a high of 37,000 miles of pipeline in the late 1990s to around 4,000. Spain also pointed out a 2014 EPA Toxics Release Inventory analysis, which tracks U.S. facilities that manage and release toxic chemicals. Koch-owned businesses managed 667 million pounds of production-related waste in 2014, but the company reported implementing 240 "Source Reduction Activities" over the same time period — more than Shell and Chevron (though the corporation listed many more facilities than the oil giants). Our ruling Reid said, "Koch Industries churns out more climate-changing greenhouse gases than oil giants Chevron, Shell and Valero." Reid’s claim accurately calls on facts established in a well-respected study of corporate pollution. Koch Industries does produce more greenhouse gas emissions than the oil companies listed by Reid. But it's a somewhat misleading, apples-to-oranges comparison, because there are more Koch facilities that cover more industries compared to the oil companies. The statement is accurate but needs additional information. That meets our definition of Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a24a3586-08cf-4ee9-a52a-85c7c46929c8	None	Harry Reid	None	None	None	2016-07-19T17:50:02	2016-07-11	['United_States', 'Koch_Industries', 'Chevron_Corporation', 'Valero_Energy_Corporation', 'Royal_Dutch_Shell']
pomt-06981	Says new GOP Wisconsin Assembly members "voted to take funding away from their public schools in their districts to give it to private Milwaukee voucher schools."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jul/13/peter-barca/wisconsin-state-rep-peter-barca-says-assembly-vote/	Although notable for cutting billions of dollars in spending and deficits, the new Wisconsin state budget also expands the nation’s largest and longest-running school choice program, which uses tax money to send nearly 21,000 lower-income Milwaukee children to private schools. The 2011-2013 budget, crafted by Republican Gov. Scott Walker and the GOP-controlled Legislature, cuts aid to public schools by nearly $800 million. But it includes nearly $12 million to pay for 3,000 more Milwaukee students the administration estimates will join the choice program over the two-year period. The expansion is one reason a Wall Street Journal editorial proclaimed 2011 "the year of school choice" in the United States. Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca, D-Kenosha, contends the expansion of choice, also known as the school voucher program, comes at the expense of public school districts throughout Wisconsin. Commenting in an article published June 26, 2011, the day Walker signed the budget into law, Barca focused his criticism on Republican members of the Assembly who were elected in November 2010. GOP freshmen who backed the budget, he claimed, "voted to take funding away from their public schools in their districts to give it to private Milwaukee choice schools." Barca, a former congressman who has served 10 years as a state lawmaker during two stints in the Assembly, made a similar claim the next day in a blog, and previously in a news release and in a letter to Walker. So, does spending more on the choice program take away money from public school districts throughout Wisconsin? First, some background. Size: The choice program, launched in the 1990-1991 school year, was created to allow low-income students in Milwaukee to attend private schools in Milwaukee at taxpayer expense. In 2010-2011, the nearly 21,000 choice students attended more than 100 private schools-- 84 percent of them religious -- according to the Public Policy Forum, a nonpartisan research organization in Milwaukee. The new state budget expands choice in three ways: Income limits were raised, making more families eligible; a cap on the number of choice students (22,500) was eliminated; and choice students can now attend private schools outside the City of Milwaukee. (Although Barca’s claim doesn’t address it, the budget also extends the choice program to students in Racine.) Cost: Private Milwaukee schools receive $6,442 in state aid for each choice student. That compares with $10,292 received in 2010-2011 by Milwaukee Public Schools, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. As we’ll see, the difference between the two per-pupil aid figures is key in the debate about the choice program’s effect on taxpayers. Financing: The $6,442 per student in tax money spent on choice in 2010-2011 came to nearly $131 million. The state pays roughly 62 percent and recoups the other 38 percent by reducing aid to Milwaukee Public Schools, according to the fiscal bureau. So, it’s clear the choice program takes money away from MPS; but whether choice is a net cost or a net gain for other public school districts is more complicated. When asked for evidence about the claim the expansion takes money away from districts outside of Milwaukee, Barca aides made three major points: The nearly $800 million in aid cuts affect only public schools. Barca spokeswoman Melanie Conklin said the state budget changes choice funding such that choice schools "are held harmless" and the aid reduction "is all taken from public districts across the state." But it doesn’t necessarily follow that the choice expansion was funded by cutting aid to public schools. Indeed, when choice was created, the state appropriated additional money for the program -- it didn’t take money from other public school districts, said Anneliese Dickman, research director of the Public Policy Forum. And when the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction detailed the nearly $800 million in what it called "catastrophic" cuts to public schools in the budget, it noted that only Milwaukee Public Schools -- no other public school districts -- lost money as a result of choice funding. GOP lawmakers rejected a move to block choice expansion. Conklin said all Republican lawmakers voted against a Democratic "save our schools" amendment to Walker’s budget that would have blocked the choice expansion. That point underscores how the new GOP lawmakers supported the expansion of choice. But it doesn’t get at the key question of whether the budget moves money from public school districts outside of Milwaukee to private schools in Milwaukee. The choice expansion means less money for all public schools. On this point, there is more debate. Conklin cited a Legislative Fiscal Bureau report that estimates the expansion will cost the state nearly $12 million. The total cost to pay for the 3,000 new students is actually $19 million, but the state would recoup 38 percent of that amount by providing about $7 million less in aid to Milwaukee Public Schools. The remaining 62 percent is the $12 million. Conklin argues that’s a $12 million cost to public school districts outside of Milwaukee. But the evidence doesn’t support her: Both Dickman of the Public Policy Forum and John Johnson, a spokesman for the state Department of Public Instruction, agreed that even if lawmakers decided against the choice expansion, it doesn’t mean the $12 million to fund it would have gone to public school districts. Lawmakers could have reallocated it for an entirely different purpose or opted not to appropriate it at all. The Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the state’s neutral authority on budget matters, declared in a November 2010 memo that other than Milwaukee Public Schools -- which loses state aid for each MPS student who transfers to a choice school -- "all school districts' aid payments and property tax levies are not affected by the choice program." Indeed, there is evidence the choice program saves money for other taxpayers around the state -- an assertion state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Evers calls debatable and another education researcher has criticized. The savings is based on the fact that choice schools get roughly $4,000 less per pupil in school aids than MPS does: A Legislative Fiscal Bureau fiscal bureau memo in May 2011 said that if choice were eliminated and 90 percent of current choice students went to Milwaukee Public Schools, non-MPS districts -- the out-state ones Barca referred to -- would have lost state money in the 2010-2011 school year. The loss would have been $82 million if the choice funds had been transferred to public schools and $155 million if the choice funds had simply been eliminated. The fiscal bureau in June 2011 cited work by professor Robert Costrell, a faculty member of the University of Arkansas’ School Choice Demonstration Project, which estimated the savings a different way. He found that in 2010-2011, using the 90 percent assumption, choice not only saved $31.5 million in state tax funds but also $57 million in property taxes for taxpayers outside of MPS. Costrell did new calculations for PolitiFact Wisconsin based on the 3,000 new students expected to enter the choice program in the next two years. If 90 percent of the new choice students instead attended MPS -- a figure Costrell said is used in other choice studies -- the higher MPS per-pupil cost would cost property taxpayers outside of MPS nearly $9 million more over two years and taxpayers statewide nearly $7 million in state taxes. But that’s based on the 90 percent assumption. What if many of the students who will be in the program didn’t come from MPS at all and instead are already in the private schools, but don’t currently qualify for choice based on income or other factors? They could stay at their school and now have tuition paid. Choice has been expanded twice before -- in 1998, when choice students were allowed to attend religious schools, and again in 2006, when the maximum number of students allowed in the program was raised. In the first year after both expansions, the Public Policy Forum found, roughly 40 percent of new choice students came from MPS schools and roughly 60 percent from private schools. Dickman said she expects a similar trend under the new choice expansion, as does Evers, the state superintendent. (One note: Walker’s budget proposal would have prohibited students who attended Milwaukee private schools in 2010-2011 from becoming choice students in 2011-2012. But that provision was removed by the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee, said Mike Ford, research associate for School Choice Wisconsin, which advocates for the choice program.) Costrell did another estimate, based on if only 40 percent of the 3,000 new students come from MPS. That would require $3.5 million more in state aid, but property taxpayers outside of MPS -- the taxpayers Barca referred to in his statement -- would still save nearly $3.9 million over two years, according to Costrell. The bottom line here is we won’t know until some time in the future how many new choice students will come from MPS or already be in a private school. But if this choice expansion plays out like the previous two, taxpayers outside of MPS would still save money as a result of the choice program, based on Costrell’s estimates. So, where does that leave us? Barca said that by supporting the 2011-2013 state budget, freshmen Republican Assembly members "voted to take funding away from their public schools in their districts to give it to private Milwaukee voucher schools." On a broad level, that is not true: the budget appropriates money separately for choice. To cover part of the cost, it reduces state aid to Milwaukee Public Schools, but not to other school districts. It is possible that if large numbers of the new choice students come from private schools rather than Milwaukee Public Schools, there could be a net loss to taxpayers outside of MPS. But research indicates that if past experience holds and 60 percent of the new choice students come from private schools, property taxpayers outside of MPS would still save money. To be sure, the full effect of the school choice expansion won’t be known for some time. But Barca didn’t state that depending on how the expansion plays out, it might cost other school districts -- he claimed that the expansion actually takes away money from those districts. There is no evidence of that. We rate Barca’s claim False.	None	Peter Barca	None	None	None	2011-07-13T09:00:00	2011-06-25	['Milwaukee']

pomt-02100	"When you read the Koran, it talks about don't take Christians and Jews as your friends."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/may/16/sean-hannity/sean-hannity-koran-says-dont-take-christians-and-j/	International concern seems to mount by the day for nearly 300 Nigerian schoolgirls held captive by Boko Haram, a militant Islamist group whose name means "Western education is forbidden." After threatening to sell the girls into slavery, a video released this week purports to show about 100 of them in full-length, black veils. The group leader says the girls converted from Christianity to Islam and will not be released unless imprisoned Boko Haram members are freed. Fox News host Sean Hannity isn’t the only pundit to denounce the group’s actions. He convened a panel on his May 12 show, which included liberal The Five co-host Bob Beckel, to criticize liberals touting the #BringBackOurGirls Twitter campaign supported by first lady Michelle Obama. We’ve seen conservatives offer similar criticisms in recent days, from Rush Limbaugh to Ann Coulter. Hannity took the discussion a step further, wondering if most Muslims subscribe to beliefs shared by Boko Haram. Beckel entered the conversation by saying the response from "supposedly moderate" heads of Muslim states has been weak. "I tried to call the Egyptian embassy and I called the Saudi embassy to ask for a comment about these 275 girls and got nothing from them! When is a cleric, when is an imam, finally going to stand up and say, ‘this is wrong’?" That’s when Hannity took over. "Do you think that this is general acceptance? When you read the Koran it talks about don’t take Christians and Jews as your friends. It talks about jihad. It talks about apostate. All these things are in there. And do you think most Muslims buy into this radicalism, or (are) there moderate Muslims that are intimidated?" Our question: Does the Koran talk about "don’t take Christians and Jews as your friends"? What is he talking about? A Fox News spokesperson said Hannity was talking about verse 5:51 of the Koran, the sacred book of Muslims. It’s a verse that has spawned blog posts and message board queries about what it really means. The original Koran (also Quran) is in Arabic, and Muslims believe it to be the word of Allah spoken to the prophet Mohammad via the angel Gabriel over a 23-year period. Just as there are multiple English translations for the Bible, there are also English translations of the Koran, and experts are split on which translations are best and true to the Arabic text -- and on whether it should be translated at all. Interpretations are subjective, as not every word in Arabic has a flawless English equivalent. "Scripture is not some sort of religious instruction manual that believers ingest uniformly and uncritically," says Kenneth Garden, a University of Tufts assistant professor of religion. "It inspires, yes, but it is also malleable and open to creative readings that highlight some passages and ignore others in ways we could never predict." Still, the Quranic Arabic Corpus, a website that allows users to select passages from the Koran and compare parallel translations, offers several English translations of verse 5:51. Here are a few we found: Saheeh International: "O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are (in fact) allies of one another. And whoever is an ally to them among you -- then indeed, he is (one) of them. Indeed, Allah guides not the wrongdoing people." Arberry: "O believers, take not Jews and Christians as friends; they are friends of each other. Whoso of you makes them his friends is one of them. God guides not the people of the evildoers." The Noble Qur'an: "O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Auliya' (friends, protectors, helpers, etc.), they are but Auliya' to one another. And if any amongst you takes them as Auliya', then surely he is one of them. Verily, Allah guides not those people who are the Zalimun (polytheists and wrong­doers and unjust)." The Message of The Quran says: "O you who have attained to faith! Do not take the Jews and Christians for your allies: they are but allies of one another -- and whoever of you allies himself with them becomes, verily, one of them; behold, God does not guide such evildoers." Most but not all of these translations refer to friends while another says allies. Is the meaning as simple as it seems? Lost in translation? What did the experts say? Reactions ranged from Hannity is partially right to wildly wrong. "Certainly 5:51 and other verses like it are great material for a group like Boko Haram to use," Garden said, while noting other verses contain messages of tolerance and warnings. "But apart from God speaking in a booming voice from on high and telling us how he would like the Koran to be interpreted, there is no objective way to say which is the correct reading of the scripture." Let’s start with the translation that introduces the word "Auliya’." Other versions use "friends," but that word connotes a sense of, well, friendliness that, according to some experts and opinions, isn’t supposed to be reflected in the text. "Auliya’" does not mean friends in the way of pals or companions. It’s meaning is more about allies, protectors or guardians. One footnote to this passage in The Message version of the Koran says "this prohibition of a ‘moral alliance’ with non-Muslims does not constitute an injunction against normal, friendly relations with such of them as are well-disposed towards Muslims." Broader historical context is key, experts told us. The verse refers to a specific period of tribal society in Mohammed’s time, one marked by interreligious strife in which some Muslims in Medina were considering siding with certain Jewish tribes, said John L. Esposito, author of What Everyone Needs to Know About Islam and founding director of Georgetown University’s Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding. "What Hannity is doing is just cherry-picking a passage," Esposito said. "It would be the equivalent of taking any of the statements in the Old Testament where God tells his people to fight and kill." "The order here is not to take them as guardians or protectors," said Khaleel Mohammed, a San Diego State University professor who has compared English translations of the Koran. "Incidentally, the word for ‘guardian’ in Arabic and in Islamic terminology is ‘wali,’ the singular of Awliya." Reading the passage as Muslims cannot be friends with Christians and Jews flies in the face of the general treatment of those religions in the Koran, Esposito said. The different faiths share a connection to Abraham and a belief in the monotheistic God, and Islam acknowledges the word of God also coming in the Torah, Psalms and Gospels of the Bible. "It contradicts the principle that both Christians and Jews are considered ‘ahl al-kitab,’ the people of the book," said Taoufik Ben Amor, Columbia University senior lecturer in Arabic studies. "Muslims can marry (Christians and Jews), trade, and coexist without forcing them to convert." What’s more relevant, some argued, is how most Muslims interpret the verse. Even though some radical Muslims may agree with Hannity’s interpretation, most moderate Muslims believe it’s a great thing to be friends with Jews and Christians, said Martha Schulte-Nafeh, University of Michigan Arabic program director. The quote Hannity pulled is "not the normative understanding of how Muslims are with people of other faith," said Edgar Hopida, spokesman for the Islamic Society of North America. Our ruling In a segment condemning Boko Haram, Hannity said the Koran contains a verse that "talks about don't take Christians and Jews as your friends." While some English translations of the Koran do include a similar phrase, some experts say Hannity is isolating the phrase out of its proper context. Also there is a debate if the true meaning of the passage is somehow altered in the translation itself. Much of the meaning depends on how people interpret scripture, which can be said for any spiritual text. Hannity’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.

pomt-07851	"If you shut down Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, it's estimated you'd have to add seven new lanes to I-95 to accommodate the increased traffic."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/11/joe-biden/joe-biden-says-closing-northeast-corridor-would-fo/	In a Feb. 8, 2011, speech at Philadelphia’s 30th Street Station, Vice President Joe Biden -- who as a U.S. senator commuted almost daily to and from his home in Delaware using Amtrak -- touted rail as an integral part of the nation’s transportation future. During his address, he made a striking comment: "If you shut down Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, it's estimated you'd have to add seven new lanes to I-95 to accommodate the increased traffic." (It wasn’t the first time he made the comparison; he also included in an article he wrote for Amtrak’s Arrive magazine.) For readers who hail from outside the northeastern U.S., we should explain what the Northeast Corridor is. Though definitions vary, the one we’ll use is the passenger rail line Amtrak uses from Washington, D.C., to Boston, with stops in such major cities as Baltimore; Wilmington, Del.; Philadelphia and New York. It is heavily trafficked by commuters and inter-city travelers -- more than 10 million riders in 2010. Interstate 95 runs from Maine to Florida. The relevant portion for Biden’s comment is the stretch that mirrors the Northeast Corridor, running from Washington north to Boston. When we asked Biden’s office to back up the claim, they said that the numbers came from the Transportation Department. Specifically, Biden’s office said, 5 billion passenger miles are traveled in the Northeast Corridor every day by rail, including both intercity rail and commuter rail, with an additional 14.5 billion vehicle miles traveled on I-95 between Washington, D.C., and New York City. Using these numbers, Biden’s office said, eliminating all trips by rail could increase volume on I-95 by 23 percent. Biden's office added that the claim factors in population growth over the next 40 years, which is projected to increase volume on I-95 by 80 percent. So the combination of eliminating rail and accommodating future growth would result in roughly a doubling of demand on I-95. Accommodating that demand during peak periods would require a doubling of I-95’s current average size of seven lanes between Washington and New York City. Steven E. Polzin, director of mobility policy for the Center for Urban Transportation Research at the University of South Florida, consented to do his own back-of-the-envelope analysis for us, using a different methodology. He said that a freeway lane can handle 1,800 to 2,000 cars per hour. If each car holds the national average of 1.6 people per vehicle, that means that each lane can accommodate up to 3,200 persons per hour. An eight-coach, two-locomotive Amtrak train has a capacity of 400 riders. So Amtrak would would need to run eight trains per hour to equal the capacity of one freeway lane. (That's more than actually run now: Amtrak often runs two trains an hour from Boston to Washington and another two in the opposite direction, plus some additional trains that travel shorter portions.) Using current Amtrak ridership numbers, Polzin got a similar result -- that eliminating Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor would require one new lane in each direction. Either way, it’s less than one-third of what the Transportation Department study suggests. "That suggests that the seven-lane number uses some real different assumptions," Polzin said. For instance, he said, if you use Amtrak’s 2050 ridership projections, if you assume that all riders go the entire length of the corridor and if demand tends to highly concentrated in a peak hour, "one could get to three lanes in each direction. But that’s a lot of unlikely ifs." Indeed, our sources raised some questions about Biden’s explanation. • Was Biden in his statement sufficiently clear that he meant future traffic loads? When we and several of our experts first read his comment, we assumed he meant that shifting the current train passenger loads to I-95 would require seven new lanes. But Biden’s office clarified that he was referring to both current and future loads. The statement is not phrased incorrectly, but we think it could have been made more precise. • How reliable are the study’s assumptions about rates of growth? The Transportation Department estimated future growth using two different approaches -- projecting travel based on Census data and using travel growth estimates from state departments of transportation. But projections over several decades come with significant uncertainty, so we are taking them with a grain of salt. • Does Biden’s calculation include traffic on regional commuter lines? In his statement, Biden said that shifting Amtrak passenger loads would cause the seven-lane increase. But commuter lines such as MARC, New Jersey Transit and SEPTA also use the corridor, and the Transportation Department confirmed that its study factored in commuter line ridership as well. Commuter lines are far from a trivial factor. Commuter rail trips in the corridor actually exceed Amtrak’s by roughly a 20-to-1 margin, although the two are similar in terms of total miles traveled, since commuter trips are typically shorter than Amtrak jaunts. We think most people would assume that Biden’s reference to shutting down "Amtrak's Northeast Corridor" referred only to Amtrak trains. Rail experts (like Biden) may know that closing down one system likely means closing down the other, but we don’t think the average listener would. So we think Biden erred in failing to mention commuter lines alongside Amtrak in his speech. • Does Biden’s calculation assume that all the rail traffic will shift to I-95? Some of the longer-distance traffic is likely to shift to airplanes -- a factor the Transportation Department confirmed did not play into its study. The problem is that the "real impact" of shutting down the Northeast Corridor could be felt in the already-congested airports in and around New York, said Robert Puentes, a transportation scholar at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. We should note that Biden did mention the potential impact on airports in a subsequent portion of his Philadelphia speech. But factoring air travel into the statistics about adding lanes would almost certainly have changed the mathematics. • Does Biden’s calculation take into consideration how people actually ride the Northeast Corridor? Say 10,000 riders travel from from Boston to New York, another 10,000 riders travel from New York to Philadelphia and 10,000 riders travel from Philadelphia to Washington. These would be counted as 30,000 riders, and their miles traveled would be lumped together. However, the the impact of switching them to I-95 would only add 10,000 lane trips, not 30,000. So where does this leave us? Biden based his comment on a professionally done, federally sponsored study. However, experts note methodological shortcomings, notably that the study does not factor in air travel, and they offer alternative models that suggest less drastic shifts than seven-lane increases. In addition, Biden compounded these uncertainties by his framing of the study. We don’t think the average person would have assumed he was talking about shutting down commuter rail systems as well as Amtrak. On balance, we rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11865	"California Democrat Maxine Waters charged on 3 counts."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2017/nov/02/blog-posting/us-rep-maxine-waters-charged-3-ethics-violations-b/	Internet posts claiming that U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., is facing corruption charges neglects to tell readers the incident is seven years old and that the charges were dropped. "California Democrat Maxine Waters charged on 3 counts," read the headline on an Oct. 6, 2017, post on NewsOfTrump.com. The headline added a hallmark of fake news sites looking to engage an audience, asking readers, "Do you support this?" Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to curb fake news. The same subject came up on other websites, as well. The NewsOfTrump.com post didn’t mention the charges in the headline, but specified in the text that she violated House rules by arranging a 2008 "meeting between the Treasury Department and representatives of OneUnited bank — where her husband was a notable shareholder." The post criticized Waters for being corrupt and said OneUnited directly benefitted from her actions. "As a member of the House Financial Committee, she was able to directly contact then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to speak with him about meeting with minority-owned banks," the post read. "Through her efforts, OneUnited bank was able to obtain $12 million in federal bailout funding to help cover expected losses from the collapse of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac." These posts describe real events, when the House ethics committee charged Waters with breaking three rules by allegedly trying to assist OneUnited, in which her husband did hold a sizeable share of stock. But the flap over the OneUnited meeting happened in 2010. Reports surfaced in 2009 that Waters had allegedly helped OneUnited CEO Kevin Cohee secure a meeting to ask for $50 million in bailout funds to recover from the Great Recession, triggering a House ethics investigation. (The bank did get $12 million.) In August 2010, the panel recommended three charges against Waters for violating ethics rules that essentially are supposed to keep members of Congress from making the House look bad. Her chief of staff, Mikael Moore, also was charged. But the posts implied or outright said that Waters is currently facing charges, making it seem as if the House had only now acted on the 2008 meeting. They also don’t mention that the ethics charges against Waters were dropped in 2012. In contentious action between Republican and Democratic members of the committee, a lawyer hired specifically to review the case found that Waters believed she had been acting in the interest of all minority-owned banks, not just OneUnited. She had called for a meeting to help those banks, and ended her involvement when she learned OneUnited was part of the group. Moore was given a letter of reproval for the incident, for not stopping Waters’ involvement once it was clear OneUnited was one of the banks asking for help. Waters is a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, which no doubt was what has earned her the attention of fake news purveyors, who typically zero in on political flashpoints. She recently earned criticism for saying she wanted to "take Trump out" and called him "the most dishonorable and despicable human being to ever serve in the office of the president." Although based on things that really happened, the fake news posts distort the timeline and leave out the final result of the House ethics committee investigation. Someone reading it would be misinformed of the events. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-05977	Newt Gingrich says electric co-ops and credit unions are "government-sponsored enterprises" like Freddie Mac.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/23/newt-gingrich/gingrich-repeats-claim-freddie-mac-credit-unions-a/	Often criticized for his lucrative work for Freddie Mac, Newt Gingrich has compared the mortgage giant to government-sponsored enterprises such as credit unions and electric co-ops. He said it again in a debate in Tampa on Jan. 23, 2012, in an effort to portray Freddie, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Association, as a benign entity that serves citizens -- not an out-of-control bureaucracy that brought down the housing market, as his rivals maintain. "Government-sponsored enterprises include, for example, telephone cooperatives, rural electric cooperatives, federal credit unions. There are many different kinds of government-sponsored enterprises, and many of them have done very good things," said Gingrich, who collected more than $1.6 million in fees from the federally chartered mortgage company. PolitiFact has checked Gingrich's claim that electric coops and credit unions are government-sponsored enterprises and found it’s not true. In the last debate before the Iowa caucuses, Gingrich had to explain another wrinkle in his past dealings with Freddie. One of the panelists asked him about his words from 2007: "I like the GSE, or government-sponsored enterprise like Freddie Mac, model." Gingrich defended his position, much the same way in that debate, saying "when you look for example at electric membership co-ops, and you look at credit unions, there are a lot of government-sponsored enterprises that are awfully important and do an awfully good job." How valid is the comparison? There is one similarity between a GSE and a credit union or an electric co-op. Neither pays federal or state income taxes. But Patrick Lavigne, spokesman for the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA), said GSE "is not a term that I’ve heard applied to electric coops before." In fact, the term GSE applies to just a handful of very particular institutions. It takes a specific act of Congress to create one, usually to ease the flow of money to a certain industry, like housing or agriculture. Glossaries like Investopedia define GSE’s as "(p)rivately held corporations with public purposes created by the U.S. Congress to reduce the cost of capital for certain borrowing sectors of the economy." When the White House submits its annual budget, it includes the GSE’s, and the list isn’t long. There are the Agricultural Credit Bank and Farm Credit Banks, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation. And that’s it. No electric co-ops. No credit unions. The 2012 White House budget explains that Congress chartered Freddie Mac in 1970 to facilitate "the flow of investment dollars from the capital markets to mortgage lenders and ultimately, to homebuyers." A credit union or an electric co-op is created completely differently. They come into being when a group of local investors pool their money. The country’s very first credit union was started in 1908 by a priest in Manchester, N.H., to provide credit to factory workers in textile mills. Washington played no role at all. Later, the federal government offered both funding assistance and regulatory guidelines. Local co-ops and credit unions need to apply to a government agency for recognition as a nonprofit, member-owed entities. And that’s another difference. Freddie Mac is owned by stockholders. Co-ops are owned by members, the people who use them. Levine, with the NRECA, says electric co-ops started in the 1930s when "farmers would each throw $5 into the hat and then ask Washington for a loan for a transformer or some power lines." Back then, and today, those loans would come with a very low interest rate, but Freddie Mac was treated even more favorably. It was formed with a direct line of credit from the federal Treasury for more than $2 billion. "They could borrow money cheaper than anyone except Uncle Sam himself," said Kathleen Day, a former Washington Post reporter who covered GSE’s for over two decades. The deal for Freddie Mac got even better. Thanks to that intimate association with the federal government, Day says "the markets perceived them as something that was backed by Washington and invested at a very low cost ... That’s what allowed it to grow." Our ruling Gingrich spoke of credit unions and electric cooperatives as if they were the same sort of entities as Freddie Mac. We find no support for that and do find major differences in how they are created and operate compared with GSEs. Congress created Freddie Mac, as it does every GSE, by passing a specific law to bring it into being. Freddie Mac has stockholders and a direct line of credit with the U.S. Treasury. The term, Government Sponsored Enterprise, applies only to a handful of financial entities listed in the federal budget. None of those characteristics apply to credit unions and electric cooperatives.

pomt-06123	"Fifty percent of Speaker Gingrich’s tax plan goes to the top 1 percent."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/28/barack-obama/obama-campaign-says-half-benefit-newt-gingrichs-ta/	President Barack Obama’s campaign managers spoke the language of the Occupy Wall Street movement last week when they took aim at the tax plan introduced by Republican candidate Newt Gingrich. "Speaker Gingrich supports the Republican budget plan that would … provide more tax breaks to millionaires, billionaires and large corporations and make the middle class foot the bill," Obama spokesman Ben LaBolt said Tuesday, Dec. 20, 2011, in a conference call with New Hampshire reporters. "Fifty percent of Speaker Gingrich’s tax plan goes to the top 1 percent," LaBolt said. (We're following our practice of attributing this claim to Obama because LaBolt was acting as a spokesman for the campaign, not speaking on his own.) Gingrich’s tax plan would cut the corporate income tax in half and would introduce a 15 percent flat tax option for all taxpayers. But would 50 percent of the benefits really go to the top 1 percent of income earners? To find the answer, the Obama campaign's press office pointed us to the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research group in Washington that recently issued a report analyzing the Gingrich tax plan. The Tax Policy Center, which has also evaluated proposals by Rick Perry and Herman Cain, among others, concluded that Gingrich’s plan would reduce total U.S. tax revenues by as much as 35 percent by 2015, the first full year the plan could be implemented. But analysts made a number of assumptions to reach these figures. First, the report assumed that those U.S. taxpayers who would see lower tax bills under Gingrich’s flat tax option, about 70 percent of taxpayers, would enroll in the plan. Also, the report assumes that tax policies currently in place, including the Bush-era tax cuts, will be extended at least through 2015. That's based on the predictions of most analysts, who expect Congress to continue extending them. (The center’s calculations do not, however, include the current payroll tax cut, which Gingrich has said he would phase out.) It’s this second assumption that is key to the Obama administration’s 50 percent figure. If the Bush cuts and other current tax policies are allowed to expire, then the Gingrich plan would cut tax revenues by about $1.3 trillion in 2015, and the top 1 percent of income earners would receive 41.6 percent of those savings, paying an average of $422,298 less in taxes. Under these parameters, the bottom 20 percent of income earners would take in 1 percent of the total savings, paying an average of $289 less, according to the center's calculations. Assuming, however, that the current tax policies continue, as most analysts suggest, the Gingrich plan would cut tax revenues by about $850 million by 2015, and about half of those savings would fall to the top 1 percent, the report concludes. Under the plan, the top earners would pay an average of $340,203 in tax under Gingrich’s plan, making up 50.1 percent of the total tax cuts. By contrast, the lowest 20 percent of income earners would pay an average of $63 less, comprising less than 1 percent of the total savings. "The wealthy get far and away the biggest benefits" of the Gingrich plan, said Roberton Williams, an analyst at the Tax Policy Center. To this point, Chris Edwards, tax policy director at the libertarian Cato Institute, notes that many such tax reform plans appear to benefit the wealthiest Americans because they are already paying taxes at a much higher rate. Currently, the top 1 percent of income earners are paying tax rates as high as 35 percent. The average federal rate for that group is 29.8 percent. Under Gingrich’s plan, it would fall to 12.8 percent, according to the Tax Policy Center report. The average federal tax rate for the lowest 20 percent of income earners would fall from 2 percent to 1.4 percent. Edwards said that would correct the current disparity that makes the wealthy shoulder too large a tax burden. "Even with the Gingrich cut, the people at the top end are still going to be paying substantially higher rates." The benefits to the country’s top earners don’t stop with the tax rate, however, Williams points out. Among other elements of the tax plan, Gingrich also proposes to eliminate taxes on capital gains, dividends and interest, among others. He says they are "the winners" of the Gingrich plan. Representatives from the Gingrich campaign didn’t return requests for comment this week. But, campaign staff told CNN Money that the Tax Policy Center analysis didn’t take into consideration the economic growth likely to result from the tax plan. They said the tax plan is part of a larger 10-year plan to balance the federal budget. Williams, of the Tax Policy Center, acknowledged that his analysis does not factor in economic growth, because that is difficult to calculate, he said. But, with the loss of $850 billion in tax revenue, the economy would have to grow at an extreme and unlikely rate to make up the losses, Williams said. "Economists generally agree that cutting taxes and making them flatter will improve economic growth. The question we disagree on is how much faster it will grow," he said. "It’s hard to see how the economy will grow fast enough to make up all the revenue losses." Our ruling The Obama campaign said "50 percent of Speaker Gingrich’s tax plan goes to the top 1 percent." The analysis of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center backs up that claim -- as long as current tax policies continue, which is what most analysts expect. As long as they are, the country’s wealthiest 1 percent would indeed receive about half of the savings under Gingrich’s plan. Still, the share would fall to 41.6 percent if the Bush cuts and other current tax policies are allowed to expire. That isn't likely to happen, but Congress will have to act to extend them. So we rate the Obama campaign's claim Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-12-28T13:09:49	2011-12-20	['None']
pomt-09765	"The richest 1 percent have more financial wealth than the bottom 95 percent combined."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/01/michael-moore/moore-says-top-1-percent-owns-more-financial-wealt/	In his new movie Capitalism: A Love Story , liberal provocateur Michael Moore tries to build a case that the rich keep getting richer while everyone else is left behind. One statistic he cites in the film, which he repeated at a Sept. 29, 2009, news conference in Washington, is that "the richest 1 percent have more financial wealth than the bottom 95 percent combined." On his Web site, Moore provides a list of sources to back up his claims. For this one, the filmmaker cites a memo written by Citigroup's research staff — a memo that plays a key role in the film as a symbol of Wall Street excess. The Citigroup document, which was provided to PolitiFact by Moore's staff, cites a table using statistics assembled by New York University and Bard College economist Edward N. Wolff. Wolff uses Federal Reserve Board findings on family wealth drawn from the Survey of Consumer Finances, a once-every-three-years study. The Citigroup document uses numbers from the 2001 survey. But before we look at the data, let's parse Moore's words closely. He didn't say the top 1 percent have "more wealth" than the bottom 95 percent. Nor did he say that they have more income than the bottom 95 percent. Rather, he specifically said they have more "financial wealth." So what is financial wealth? That's subject to debate. Wolff uses two key measurements of wealth. One is net worth, which means someone's total assets minus total liabilities. Net worth includes cash holdings, financial assets like stocks and bonds, real estate, the value of life insurance policies and retirement plans, equity from unincorporated businesses, and the value of trust funds. The amount owed from mortgages and consumer debt are subtracted from this amount, while household appliances and the future value of Social Security benefits and private pension plans are kept out of the calculations, because they cannot be easily converted into cash. Wolff's second measurement is called either "financial wealth" (as Citigroup's memo labeled it) or "non-home wealth" (as Wolff himself called it in a 2007 paper analyzing the Fed survey data). Put simply, it's net worth minus the net equity of one's home. Wolff justifies separating out house equity for two reasons. One is that it is not easy to convert a home to cash on short notice. The other is that primary homes serve a dual purpose — they provide shelter as well as storing wealth. In the news conference, Moore correctly reported what the Citigroup memo said about the second category, financial wealth. According to the document, which uses numbers from the 2001 Fed survey, the top 1 percent owned 39.7 percent of the financial wealth, while the bottom 95 percent owned 32.5 percent. Because the Fed has released two surveys since its 2001 study, we wanted to see whether the same pattern has held. In his 2007 paper, Wolff used 2004 survey data, which found that the top 1 percent owned 42.2 percent of the non-home wealth, compared to 31 percent for the bottom 95 percent. Once again, Moore's right. We crunched the raw numbers using the 2007 survey data, which had been published in early 2009. Moore is right again: the top 1 percent held 48.4 percent of non-home wealth, compared to 20 percent for the bottom 95 percent. For the second straight survey, in fact, the concentration of wealth increased. So Moore's right? Not so fast. Arthur B. Kennickell, a Fed economist, periodically publishes papers analyzing the survey statistics in great detail. In his most recent paper, published on Jan. 7, 2009, Kennickell provides a breakdown of dozens of key statistics based on income level. Deep inside his data-laden paper is a statistic called "financial wealth." That shares a name with the measurement Wolff used (and which was later cited by Citigroup and Moore) but Kennickell calculates it differently. "Financial wealth," as defined in Kennickell's paper, starts with Wolff's measurement but then subtracts several other categories, including vehicles (not just cars but also boats, airplanes and helicopters); other real estate held (including equity in second homes); the equity from closely held businesses; and the value of antiques, artwork and similar items. These mathematical differences are enough to switch Moore's assertion from correct to incorrect. By Kennickell's measurement of "financial wealth," the top 1 percent own 31.5 percent of the financial wealth — less than the 40.2 percent for the bottom 95 percent. That indicates a large chunk of the wealth for the top 1 percent comes from vehicles, second homes, businesses and hobbies. (We presume it's the top 1 percent that owns the Ferraris and summer homes in the Hamptons.) Moore deserves credit for correctly reporting the Citigroup statistic, and the data it's based on — both the Fed survey and Wolff's analysis — are respected. But this comparison shows that you can crunch numbers different ways and get different results. Indeed, Alan Reynolds, a scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, expresses skepticism of most narrower definitions of "wealth," suggesting that removing factors like home equity — a more widely held asset than stocks and bonds — biases these calculations. In fact, Moore would be wrong if he used the broader category of net worth to make his assertion. According to the 2004 Fed survey, the top 1 percent held 34.3 percent of the nation's net worth, compared to a collective 41 percent for the bottom 95 percent. (In fact, Moore or his staff was careful enough to actually correct a mistake that Citigroup had made on this point; the memo had said, incorrectly, that the top 1 percent possessed greater net worth than the bottom 95 percent.) Moore's camp emphasizes that however you slice the numbers, the richest Americans continue to hold a disproportionate share of the wealth — and on this point, other experts concur. "The important point is that there's an enormous disparity" in wealth in the United States, said Brookings Institution scholar Ron Haskins. The Fed survey may actually understate the true concentration of wealth. The survey specifically excludes members of the Forbes 400 richest families in America. Because "the closer you get to the top, the bigger the disparity" between rich and poor, a lot of concentrated wealth gets left out, Haskins said. (The new version of Forbes' list, released on Oct. 1, 2009, found that the collective worth of the 400 richest families fell $300 billion compared to the previous year; if the wealth of slightly less rich households also decreased, that could change the numbers.) So let's recap. Moore correctly cited the Citigroup memo's contents, and on the larger question, he's correct that the richest 1 percent of Americans own a vastly disproportionate share of the nation's wealth. But we'll take him down a notch because, using another methodology, his statement would not be correct. So we rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-04042	Says Oak Grove is "one of the largest cities in Oregon" and is "the biggest city in Clackamas County and it's not a city."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2013/jan/30/charlotte-lehan/oak-grove-one-largest-cities-oregon-clackamas-coun/	In an exit interview with The Oregonian, outgoing Clackamas County board chairwoman Charlotte Lehan was asked what she would have done differently while in office. "I've been asked that question before, so I've thought about it quite a bit. The only thing I can think of is the work we did on Oak Grove on the tree ordinance," she said. Some people from that part of unincorporated Clackamas County wanted a tree ordinance, but Lehan says the county should not have helped. Why? Because that’s work cities do, and if anything, the county should have helped launch "Oak Grove into its own city-hood" so it could pass its own tree ordinance. "They are way too big, they are one of the largest cities in Oregon. They should be a powerhouse in Oregon. They should have a faction at the county level, the state level and the city level," she said. Later, in the interview, she said, "It's the biggest city in Clackamas County and it's not a city." That we had a potential city this large in Clackamas County was news to us. We wanted to know: If incorporated, would Oak Grove be the largest city in Clackamas County? Would it be one of the largest cities in Oregon? Oak Grove has a cinema and a market center. Its population in 2010 was 16,629, according to the U.S. Census. That didn’t sound very large to us, so we consulted our colleagues who cover the county. And it turns out that county insiders all know that Oak Grove is more than just Oak Grove when talking about the controversial topic of incorporation. A group called Friends of Local Control has wanted to incorporate the areas of Oak Grove, Jennings Lodge and Oatfield, although they’ve never gotten so far as to draw boundaries. However, the area in question is roughly the area served by the Oak Lodge Water District and last we heard, residents surveyed wanted little to do with incorporation and any new city fees that would bring. Let’s flesh out the estimated population of this city-in-waiting. According to the Census, Jennings Lodge had a population of 7,315 in 2010 and Oatfield had a population of 13,415. Add them all up, and a proposed city would have 37,359 residents. (This is the most recent year available for unincorporated census areas.) The largest city in Clackamas County is Lake Oswego, with 36,619 people in 2010 and an estimated 37,046in 2011, according to the U.S. Census. Oregon City, the county seat, had an estimated 32,500 people in 2012, compared with 36,770 for Lake Oswego. (The 2012 estimates are by Portland State University.) So the bottom line is that a new city of Oak Grove, Jennings Lodge and Oatfield would rival Lake Oswego as the most populous city in Clackamas County. Lehan is on the right track with that claim, if you keep in mind that Oak Grove is a sort of shorthand for a larger area. Now, what about the claim that the area in question is "one of the largest cities in Oregon?" Let’s look at the large-ish cities we do have, according to Portland State’s 2012 calculations and 2011 Census estimates. July 2012 PSU July 2011 Census Portland 587,865 593,820 Eugene 158,335 156,929 Salem 156,455 156,244 Gresham 105,970 107,439 Hillsboro 92,550 93,455 Beaverton 91,205 91,625 Bend 77,455 77,905 Medford 75,545 75,501 Springfield 59,840 59,695 Corvallis 55,055 54,674 Lake Oswego ranks No. 13 in both columns. Lehan said in an email to PolitiFact Oregon that she was referring to the "unincorporated, generally contiguous area that includes Clackamas, Jennings Lodge, Oak Grove, Oak Lodge, Oatfield and other neighboring neighborhoods." She estimates the total population at "nearly 40,000, putting it slightly ahead of Lake Oswego." (Oak Lodge Water commissioner Jim Knapp, who disapproves of incorporation, does not contest her number.) She also said that there are 242 incorporated cities in Oregon. A mythical new city of Oak Grove would be 13th or 14th. "If it were anywhere in the top 15, or even the top 20, out of 242 cities I would not consider it to be inaccurate to say it is among Oregon's largest cities," she wrote. We can see her point of view. On the other hand, Oregon is a state of small towns and cities, so it’s not that hard to crack the top 20. According to Portland State, 214 of 242 cities are under 20,000 people. Lehan said in her exit interview that Oak Grove "should be up there with Gresham and Beaverton and Hillsboro and they aren't." Maybe Oak Grove should be a bigger power player in the tri-county region, but population-wise, it’s simply not on par with the Washington County cities of Hillsboro or Beaverton, or Gresham in east Multnomah County. And really, Oak Grove pales next to the 49,425 residents in the unincorporated "census designated place" of Aloha in Washington County. Where does that leave us ruling-wise? Well, we understand that Lehan was speaking with a county readership in mind, using geographic shorthand to describe an issue familiar to some people in Clackamas County. But it’s our job to rate statements for a general readership. First, estimates show that a new Oak Grove city would rival Lake Oswego for the honor of largest city in Clackamas County, but we don’t have an apples to apples count. The most recent numbers for the pretend city is from 2010, and a population count would depend on the precision of new boundaries. Second, if incorporated, the city would land in the top 15 most populous cities in Oregon -- but the statement is missing information on just how small it would be compared with other large cities. The cities she names -- Beaverton, Gresham and Hillsboro -- are twice the size. Third, Oak Grove itself has fewer than 20,000 people. Words matter to PolitiFact Oregon and here, she didn’t spell out the larger geographical area. We rate Lehan’s statement Half True. It is partially accurate but leaves out a cumulation of important details.	None	Charlotte Lehan	None	None	None	2013-01-30T03:00:00	2013-01-08	['Oregon']
pomt-12613	"Florida Sheriff: Blacks should learn to act like white people in order to stay alive."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2017/apr/02/blog-posting/did-florida-sheriff-say-blacks-should-learn-act-wh/	Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan has shared controversial thoughts on race, crime and African-American culture in a couple of videos. But he didn't go as far as some blogs would have you believe. The video clips have circulated across the Internet for years under this headline: "Florida Sheriff: Blacks should learn to act like white people in order to stay alive." We noticed the headline on Aazah, a news and entertainment website for LGBTQ persons of color. Facebook flagged a post with the misleading headline as part of its efforts to identify fake news. In this case the headline is misleading, but the contents of the story are not necessarily fake. The spliced video clips of Morgan first circulated about four years ago, said Amber Southard, a spokeswoman for Morgan, who was re-elected to a third term in November 2016. "Nowhere in the video does he say" what the headline says, she said. Morgan has been in the news for controversial statements or practices involving African-Americans, but the claim that he did made the statement in the headline is wrong. We didn’t hear that statement in the videos, and we searched for it in Nexis and found no evidence that Morgan said it. We attempted to reach someone at the website where we saw this headline and were unsuccessful. We can’t fully evaluate Morgan’s comments because they appear to stem from partial videos and not full speeches. However, here is a summary of what he did say in the clips with some added context from other news accounts. PolitiFact Florida examined the origins of this claim as part of the inaugural International Fact-Checking Day, April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.org describe the day as "not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts -- and fact-checking -- in politics, journalism, and everyday life." ‘Let me take issue with the title of African-American' In the first video clip, Morgan appears to be speaking in a sheriff’s office. "First off, let me take issue with the title of ‘African-American,’" Morgan begins. "We’re Americans." Morgan then explains that he is "fourth-generation Welsh" and doesn’t refer to himself as a "Welsh-American." "I was not born in Wales and the blacks that currently reside in the United States of America are not from Africa," he says. "Those sorts of terms that society has come to use are divisive in nature." Morgan then says many issues in the minority community in Escambia County are real while "most of them are perceived." Morgan then says that not that many years ago, the thought of an African-American president would have been unthinkable but Barack Obama won election twice by getting the votes of people of various races -- not just blacks. "If we’re such a racist nation, why do we currently have an African-American president?" he says. The video shows Morgan offering his critique of the black community: "We have unfortunately in the black community embraced a thug culture -- one that aggrandizes, again, foul language, shooting cops, abusing women and if you don’t think those things have an effect on our children, you need to get a grip." Cites black-on-white crime incidents One of the video clips appears to come from part of a speech that Morgan made at a Rotary Club meeting in August 2013. His speech followed an incident in which two white Escambia deputies shot an unarmed black man who was looking for cigarettes in his mother’s car parked in his driveway. The deputies fired multiple rounds and two bullets struck 60-year-old Roy Middleton, shattering his leg. The deputies were responding to a burglary call. (A grand jury later found insufficient evidence to prosecute the officers but called for more intensive training for deputies.) The video clip circulating on the Internet shows Morgan recounting three violent crime incidents that involved black perpetrators and white victims. "Last night we had four black male teenagers attack a 77-year-old white man," he said. "Where is the public outrage in that?" He also recounted a homicide in which he said three black people beat a white woman to death and a time a black man shot an unarmed white man "execution style." Morgan then calls for "equality across the board" and calls for working together with families, schools and churches to bring back "character and integrity to our communities." He says that criminologists have identified the "rise of the superpredators" -- people who are "not tethered to faith, family, religion or community." "It's about me, it's about my personal wants, needs and desires to the exclusion of anyone and everything and most assuredly institutions," he said. We read news articles about other portions of Morgan’s speech that were not included in the video clips. "I'll share with you a political axiom that I think is appropriate today for what the Escambia County Sheriff's Office is currently facing," he said, according to the Pensacola News Journal. "When forced to swallow (excrement) ... it is recommended to swallow it whole and for God's sake, don't chew it. We've been handed a couple of these here recently, and I'm doing my best to choke them down." (Slate wrote that the word Morgan used was "turds.") The audience laughed, and Morgan then discussed the apparent "lack of race relations" in the county. "I was of the opinion, until just recently, that we have built some bridges in the community, and obviously we have not," he said. "No one is more appalled by this than I ... I will also tell you that we intend to stay the course." Our ruling A headline that appeared on many websites quoted a Florida sheriff as saying "blacks should learn to act like white people in order to stay alive." The articles include video clips of Escambia Sheriff David Morgan giving a Rotary Club address about black-on-white crime and the local outrage over the shooting of a black man by two white police officers. The stories use real quotes from Morgan, but not the one given most prominence in the headline. We listened to the clips and did not hear Morgan make that particular statement.

pomt-06947	"Fracturing or horizontally fracturing the shale to open up larger pockets of natural gas ... has been used for over 60 years and, as of 2009, over 80,000 wells have been fracked in Ohio."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/jul/19/kris-jordan/state-sen-kris-jordan-says-fracking-has-been-used-/	During a recent debate in the Ohio Senate over a proposed law to allow drilling at state parks, some lawmakers focused on fracking, an increasingly controversial technique used to extract oil and gas from underground. Republican Sen. Kris Jordan was among those to defend process. He questioned why Democrats and others were so worried, considering fracking’s long history in Ohio. "The process of fracturing or horizontally fracking the shale to open up larger pockets of natural gas in order to make it financially feasible to drill the wells – this process has been used for over 60 years and, as of 2009, over 80,000 wells have been fracked in Ohio," Jordan said on the Senate floor on June 15. Considering that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is studying hydraulic fracturing’s effects on drinking water and since fracking will remain a topic of interest as more oil and gas companies are expected to tap Ohio’s natural gas deposits, PolitiFact Ohio decided to look at Jordan’s claim. So what is fracking? Fracking -- hydraulic fracturing -- is a technique that uses a combination of water, sand and chemicals to free up natural gas or oil beneath the surface. First, a well is drilled. Then, the fluid is shot down the well at high pressure, causing rock formations to crack and release natural gas or oil. The fracking fluid is then either recycled, stored in deep underground wells or treated. Concerns over fracking have grown lately for a variety of reasons. Chesapeake Energy temporarily halted fracking operations in Bradford County, Pa., after a well blew out in April, causing thousands of gallons of fracking fluid to spill into a nearby waterway. Such incidents have coincided with the increased popularity of the "Gasland," a documentary made in 2010, which attempts to show the environmental dangers of fracking, including a scene about flammable tap water. We called Jordan to find out more about fracking in Ohio. He said his information came from Thomas Stewart, the Ohio Oil and Gas Association’s executive vice president and lobbyist. "I’ll trust him as one of the experts," Jordan said. Indeed, we found an April interview in which Stewart said pretty much the same thing as Jordan: "We’ve been fracturing wells in the state of Ohio since the early 1950s. There’s been over 80,000 wells hydraulically fractured in the state of Ohio," Stewart said then. According to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, which regulates oil and gas drilling in Ohio, hydraulic fracturing in Ohio began 59 years ago in 1952. From that year to 2009, 80,306 wells were hydraulically fractured. So it appears Jordan is pretty much on the mark. He was a little off when he said fracking has occurred for more than 60 years, the fact remains the technique has been around for decades. But Jordan’s and Stewart’s statements are not exactly the same. The difference highlights environmentalists’ growing concerns. Jordan mentioned "horizontal" fracturing while Stewart made no such distinction. Stewart actually discussed the differences between vertical and horizontal fracturing in his April interview. Horizontal fracturing is related to horizontal drilling, a newer drilling method in which a well is first drilled vertically into the ground, then horizontally for thousands of feet. This allows drillers to access more underground resources through a single vertical well. Of the more than 80,000 Ohio wells that have been fracked, 39 have been horizontally fractured, according to ODNR. The overwhelming majority of fracturing jobs have been for vertical wells. An ODNR geologist and the Ohio Oil and Gas Association say both vertical and horizontal fracturing are equally safe when properly regulated. But to environmentalists, the difference is important. Ellen Mee, director of environmental health policy for the Ohio Environmental Council, said the more recent, horizontal fracturing method is more dangerous because it uses more water and more chemicals to extract the gas. And the fracking fluid is shot at a higher pressure. Mee also noted recent accidents at sites conducting horizontal fracking – a preferred method to extract natural gas from shale formations around Pennsylvania and New York. "The difference is really quite significant," Mee said. "We’re really talking about a significantly risky endeavor." Tom Tomastik, an ODNR geologist, disagreed. He said the potential for problems are the same. Tomastik said past problems with hydraulic fracturing in Ohio were due to faulty well construction rather than perceived flaws in the fracking process. Tomastik said the media has irresponsibly hyped the dangers of fracking. "It’s made it look like this technology is hazardous and causes all kinds of problems when we can demonstrate that it hasn’t," Tomastik said. In a fact sheet available online, ODNR stresses that none of its water well investigations since 1990 have uncovered problems caused by hydraulic fracturing. The fact sheet also addresses fears that fracking could contaminate drinking waters. It is "impossible for frack fluid to travel upward thousands of feet, or between rock formations and into freshwater aquifers," according to the ODNR. A recent study by Duke University researchers did show that houses near sites that used horizontal fracturing to extract natural gas in New York and Pennsylvania were more likely to have methane contamination in drinking water systems. But the study failed to directly connect the contamination to fracking activity. "More research is needed across this and other regions to determine the mechanism(s) controlling the higher methane concentrations we observed," the report said. Where does that leave Jordan’s claim? Jordan correctly cites the statistic for the number of times hydraulic fracturing has been used on wells in Ohio. And while he overstated the time frame slightly, he wasn’t off by much. His underlying point, though, was that hydraulic fracturing is not new to Ohio and, he argues, that the technique is relatively safe. But he specifically mentioned horizontal fracturing, which is a much newer technique. When we asked him about the discrepancy, Jordan said he assumed all the fracturing in Ohio was horizontal. "Maybe I didn’t ask if it was horizontal or vertical," Jordan said. That’s an important fact to know, especially since the state says horizontal fracturing has only been used 39 times in Ohio. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate the statement Half True. Comment on this item.	None	Kris Jordan	None	None	None	2011-07-19T06:00:00	2011-06-15	['Ohio']

pomt-13979	"30,000 Arizonans may have no choice" on Affordable Care Act coverage.	mostly true	/arizona/statements/2016/jun/10/john-mccain/mccain-ad-claims-arizonans-affordable-care-act/	Sen. John McCain has picked up his attacks on the Affordable Care Act recently, making the law synonymous with his Democratic rival, U.S. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick of Flagstaff. A May 17 attack ad from McCain against Kirkpatrick, who’s running for McCain’s Senate seat, is a case in point. In addition to the claim that the healthcare law is her "proudest" vote, the ad’s on-screen text states, "30,000 Arizonans may have no choice" for healthcare coverage, citing the departure of UnitedHealthCare, the nation’s largest insurer, from the state’s marketplace. "That’s devastating, especially to rural counties," the ad’s narrator points out. While folks who have United will be insured through Dec. 31, 2016, we wondered whether thousands of Arizonans really won’t have a health care coverage choice come 2017. (No coverage results in a penalty.) Background United announced in April that it would stop Affordable Care Act coverage in Arizona - and most of the 34 states it has plans in - by year’s end. May 11 was the deadline for health insurers to submit their 2017 Affordable Care Act state coverage plans to the federal government, which runs HealthCare.gov. In eight rural Arizona counties - Cochise, Graham, Greenlee, La Paz, Pinal, Santa Cruz, Yavapai and Yuma - only one health insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield, signed up to cover individuals. Right now, only United and Blue Cross offer health insurance plans across all eight counties. How many insured people in these counties stand to be affected in 2017? Those are the people who will only get to choose Blue Cross. People insured may vary McCain campaign spokeswoman Lorna Romero pointed us to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services data for insured people in those eight counties. According to the data, 30,761 people across all eight counties bought coverage through the exchange as of Feb. 1, 2016. However, Allen Gjersvig, director of Enrollment Services at Arizona Alliance for Community Health Centers, a umbrella group for healthcare organizations that help people sign up for coverage, said the numbers do not specifically note how many people have either United or Blue Cross. "It’s a snapshot, we don’t know what plan they chose," Gjersvig said. We asked Blue Cross Blue Shield specifically how many people currently have health insurance plans - and what plans they expect to offer in 2017 - in those eight counties, but they declined to provide those details, citing the "competitive landscape." "There are counties and consumers that will, as it stands right now, see only one insurance company," Gjersvig said. "Blue Cross has filed rates for all counties in Arizona." It’s worth pointing out that health insurance coverage options in rural areas are limited overall. Insurers note that people in rural areas tend to be sicker and rack up more health care costs. But rural areas also have fewer physicians than urban areas. Our ruling McCain’s campaign ad said, "30,000 Arizonans may have no choice" for Affordable Care Act coverage. The 30,000 number is just a snapshot of how many people have bought coverage through the exchange in those eight Arizona counties. That could change, plus it's based on months old data. But, the ad’s claim is largely correct. In 2017, Blue Cross Blue Shield stands to be the lone health insurer for Arizonans seeking health insurance in those counties. We rate the ad’s claim as Mostly True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2016-06-10T20:00:00	2016-05-17	['None']

pomt-04913	"The judicial system is the most underfunded in this state, able to only pay 52 percent of its obligations. Meanwhile, judges get some of the richest pensions of all public employees."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/aug/02/shirley-turner/new-jersey-judges-pension-system-most-underfunded-/	Take a severely underfunded pension system, combined with some of the richest benefits paid to public employees, and according to state Sen. Shirley Turner, you’ve got a "recipe for disaster." That’s how Turner characterized the retirement system for New Jersey judges when state legislators returned to Trenton this week to ensure jurists contribute more toward their pensions and health benefits. The state Supreme Court recently ruled those higher payments unconstitutional. To counter that ruling, the state Legislature on Monday approved legislation placing a question on the November ballot to amend the state constitution and allow the greater contributions. "The judicial system is the most underfunded in this state, able to only pay 52 percent of its obligations. Meanwhile, judges get some of the richest pensions of all public employees," Turner (D-Mercer), who sponsored the legislation, said during a speech on the Senate floor. "That mixture of underfunding and high benefit is a sure recipe for disaster, both for the jurists promised the pension and also our hard-working taxpayers who would be on the hook if this system fails." As PolitiFact New Jersey learned, Turner’s recipe isn’t missing any ingredients. Of the five major pension funds, the Judicial Retirement System has the lowest percentage of funds necessary to meet future pension obligations, according to the latest data from the state Department of the Treasury. At the same time, judges, on average, are receiving the largest annual pensions of all public employees in those systems, according to Treasury data. First, let’s address how the Judicial Retirement System is underfunded. As of July 1, 2011, the system had about $305 million in assets, but had accrued nearly $586 million in long-term liabilities. In other words, the state only had roughly 52 percent of the money needed to fulfill its obligations. That percentage represents the lowest amount of the five major pension funds. Now, we’ll talk about the pension amounts paid to judges. The average annual benefit among all retirees in the Judicial Retirement System was $90,837 as of July 1, 2011, and more than $100,000 for those who retired in the preceding year. Those pensions represent the highest benefits among public employees in the five major systems. By comparison, the Public Employees’ Retirement System, which includes both state and local government employees, provided an average annual benefit of $22,486 among all state retirees and $32,495 for new state retirees. Our ruling In a speech Monday on the Senate floor, Turner said: "The judicial system is the most underfunded in this state, able to only pay 52 percent of its obligations. Meanwhile, judges get some of the richest pensions of all public employees." The senator’s claim is on target.

pomt-12155	Says his time away from Washington coincides with a "long planned renovation" for the White House.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/aug/08/donald-trump/renovations-Trump-out-White-House/	President Donald Trump partly blamed White House renovations for his Bedminster golf course retreat in a tweet on Aug. 7, 2017. "Working hard from New Jersey while White House goes through long planned renovation. Going to New York next week for more meetings." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We’ve already rated Trump’s promise to not take vacations as Stalled, but we wondered about the scope and timeline of the renovations keeping him away from the Oval Office. It turns out they were indeed long in the planning. The West Wing’s 27-year-old heating, ventilation and air conditioning system is being re-upped because thanks to constant use, deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters said, the system is well past its life cycle. "The West Wing will be without air conditioning for the next two weeks, which is why the staff and the president are moving out, because I don’t think any of you would like to be in the West Wing in an August D.C. summer day when it’s over 100 degrees with no air conditioning," Walters said. The General Service Administration assessed and priced at $1.97 million the installation of a new system in the West Wing in 2014, but only presented a plan to change it in the fall of 2016. The Obama administration approved the project but left its realization to the next president. The Trump administration will take advantage of the time for the air conditioning repair to also switch out the carpeting and paint the walls. Those cosmetic changes, Perry said, are commonplace for an incoming first family. These renovations typically occur closer to Inauguration Day, but the Trump administration deferred them until August. Carpet replacement will cost $1.17 million and a fresh coat of paint $275,000. Betty Monkman, who served as White House curator from 1967 to 2002, told us that August is a great time for refurbishments as the president and his family are away, staffers take vacation, and Congress isn’t in session. The staffers who are still working in the West Wing were relocated to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, an unusual move for annual refurbishments. "I don’t remember the staff being moved to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, but this affects the whole building," Monkman said. "The West Wing is small for all the staff that uses those spaces and it’s constantly being updated, so things change to accommodate that." The last time the HVAC unit was changed in the residence (which is separate from the West Wing) was in 1994, Monkman recalled. The renovation was still in the works when President Bill Clinton and his family returned from Martha’s Vineyard, so they stayed across the street at the Blair House, the president’s guest house. The Trumans also stayed at the Blair House when they gutted and rebuilt the White House. In addition to these changes, the White House is also renovating the Navy Mess kitchen, the West Wing lower lobby, the IT system and the South Portico steps. And following a week of flash floods in Washington (as well as frequent discussion of leaks to the press), they’re addressing ceiling leaks in the Lower Press area. Our rating Trump said the White House was going "through long planned renovation." The HVAC system upheaval keeping him and his staff out of the West Wing has been in the planning since 2014, while other typical White House refurbishments like carpet replacement and repainting have been put off since the inauguration. Presidents typically take an August recess and relocate to Blair House if more time is necessary, so we see nothing out of the ordinary in Trump’s tweet. We rate this statement True.

pomt-01456	Data on violent crime shows Wisconsin "has become less safe than it was when Scott Walker took office."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/02/wisconsin-professional-police-association/violent-crime-wisconsin-higher-under-scott-walker-/	The state’s largest police union explained its endorsement of Mary Burke for governor by saying Wisconsin has become more dangerous. "Under Scott Walker, not only has Wisconsin trailed its neighbors in creating jobs but in combating violent crime as well," Jim Palmer, the Wisconsin Professional Police Association's executive director, told reporters on Sept. 25, 2014. "The crime data shows that Wisconsin has become less safe than it was when Scott Walker took office." Unlike many statistics-driven claims we have seen, the union did not offer a specific number for a narrow period. Rather, it cited the more general "less safe" and pointed to the nearly four years since Walker took office. It also added an element of blame -- that any increase in violent crime is at least partly Walker’s fault. Many factors -- demographics, rates of incarceration, even police misreporting offenses -- can contribute to fluctuations in the incidence of crime, which is typically viewed more as a local issue than a statewide one. Still, the governor does have some say in how much money local governments have to spend. So let’s investigate. Violent crime data Palmer referred us to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports. Four offenses are counted as violent crimes: murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault. One problem: The most recent year available is 2012, so the numbers only cover about half of Walker's time as governor. We found that Wisconsin’s violent crime rate declined each year from 2007 through 2011, Walker’s first year in office, but increased in 2012. Year Wisconsin population Number of violent crimes Violent crimes/ 100,000 people One-year change in rate 2011 5,711,76 13,532 236.9 -4.7% 2012 5,726,398 16,064 280.5 +18.4% Nationally, violent crime also declined each year 2007 through 2011. But, in contrast to Wisconsin, the national rate declined again in 2012, to 386.9 violent crimes per 100,000 residents. In any case, it’s important to note that based on available statistics, the union's claim can't account for nearly the entire second half of Walker’s term. That is a significant unknown. Walker’s role As for pinning an increase in Wisconsin’s violent crime rate on Walker, local police and sheriff’s departments -- not the State Patrol or Capitol Police -- are most responsible for fighting crime. At the same time, cities, villages, towns and counties get a big chunk of their revenue from the state. And Walker also put strict limits on how much local governments could raise property taxes. Palmer pointed us to Walker’s first state budget, for 2011-’13 -- which reduced "shared revenue" to local governments. He also cited a related fact-check we did during the failed campaign to recall Walker in 2012. In that item, we found that Walker cut shared revenue by $76 million, or 9 percent -- the largest reduction in at least a decade. But two other points from that fact-check are also important: Shared revenue is general aid from the state that local governments use for various programs, not just police and fire. The state money is typically mixed with local money and isn’t tied to a specific local government function. Walker’s Act 10 collective bargaining reform law helped many local governments absorb at least some of the shared revenue cuts by forcing most public employees (though not police and firefighters) to pay more for their health and pension benefits. As for the size of law enforcement agencies, Palmer cited state Office of Justice Assistance statistics covering the more than 12,000 sworn officers in local police and sheriff’s departments, as well in the State Patrol, universities and the state Department of Natural Resources. The number of sworn officers per 1,000 residents declined by 2 percent in 2011 and 1.8 percent in 2012. But local governments, not the governor, ultimately make decisions that determine the lion’s share of front-line law enforcement officers around the state. Our rating The Wisconsin Professional Police Association union said: Data on violent crime shows Wisconsin "has become less safe than it was when Scott Walker took office." In 2012, Walker’s second year in office, violent crime increased and he reduced funding to local governments. But the available violent crime data cover only about half of Walker’s time in office, so the union’s statement is based at best on a partial picture. Beyond that, a number of factors other than the governor bear on the rate of violent crime. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-06920	"The only growth sector that we’ve had in the last two years in America is government growth."	false	/texas/statements/2011/jul/22/kay-bailey-hutchison/sen-hutchison-says-government-only-growth-sector-n/	Questioned about how the United States should bring down its national debt, U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas said government spending cuts, not tax increases, are the best tool. "We think the government is spending too much," the Republican said during a June 29 interview on CNBC. "The only growth sector that we've had in the last two years in America is government growth. That's not the way to come out of this massive $14 trillion debt burden that most surely is going to affect the middle class, and so I think the answer is not to tax anyone further, but to cut government spending." We wondered if Hutchison's government growth statement was on the money. During the interview, Hutchison didn't specify what kind of growth she was talking about. Her office told us later that she was referring to employment. To support Hutchison’s statement, her office sent us a graph originally posted in February in a blog on the website of the conservative Heritage Foundation, which attributed the figures to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The bureau, which is the government’s official source for job numbers, breaks down data on total (nonfarm) employment in several ways, including into the broad categories of "private" and "government" jobs but also into more detailed private industry sectors such as manufacturing and health care. The graph compares employment trends in two categories — the hefty private sector and the much smaller federal government — over a three-year period, from January 2008 (the month after the latest recession began) to January 2011. According to the graph, the federal workforce, excluding postal and temporary census workers, grew 11.7 percent in those years while private-sector employment fell 6.6 percent. That seems to support Hutchison's statement. However, the graph's time period doesn't align perfectly with the two-year period mentioned by Hutchison. Also, it solely tracks a subset of federal government workers, a qualification Hutchison did not make in her statement. In the CNBC interview, Hutchison specified a time period of "the last two years." Yet the graph covers a three-year span that ended five months before the interview. Significantly, when assessing employment trends, altering a time frame — even slightly — can change the picture. That's so in this case with private-sector employment. Hutchison’s office correctly pointed out that the number of private-sector jobs is far lower (about 6 percent) than it was before the start of the recession in December 2007. Yet, figures show, there has been private-sector growth more recently. At the time of the senator's interview, the most recent monthly employment data available from BLS was for May 2011. We found that between May 2009 and May 2011, private-sector jobs increased by about half a million (from 108.4 million to 108.9 million). There also was growth over the two-year period from April 2009 (108.7 million) to April 2011 (108.8 million). Then again, the result flip-flops — showing private-sector job losses — if you start the two-year comparison with March, February or January of this year. What gives? The answer has to do with the long-term trend. Starting in February 2008, the number of private-sector jobs in the United States fell for 25 months. In March 2010, that figure began to inch up again. It wasn't until April 2011 that the figure surpassed its two-year-previous level. Looking at the last two years of data on the number of federal employees who do not work for the Census Bureau or the post office, as the graph specifies, supports Hutchison's claim that there was growth. According to BLS information, that category of workers increased between May 2009 (2.1 million) and May 2011 (2.2 million). James Sherk, a Heritage Foundation policy analyst, explained that it made sense to use federal employment data that excluded postal and temporary census workers in the graph because it was created to highlight the part of the federal work force that is under President Barack Obama's control. The census workers were short-term employees whose hiring did not represent a long-term trend, Sherk said. And changes in the level of postal employees are determined by the demand for the agency's services, he said. But in her CNBC statement, Hutchison didn't say non-postal, non-census federal workers, or even simply federal workers. She said government. BLS reports information on overall government employment as a combination of federal, state and local workers. (The latter two categories make up the vast majority of the total.) From May 2009 to May 2011, total government employment dropped from 22.6 million to 22.1 million. In a July 12 item, PolitiFact National found that declines in state and local workforces have driven the overall drop in government workers. Among factors noted: the end of federal stimulus aid to states, continuing weakness in the economy and shrinking state and local revenue. Another recent PolitiFact National item noted that between the official end of the recession in June 2009 and June 2011, private payrolls have increased by about 1 million workers while government payrolls have declined by about 490,000. That’s the opposite of Hutchison's claim. Hutchison spokeswoman Lisette Mondello told us that even though the senator did not specify "federal" in her CNBC statement about government growth, the senator was obviously referring to federal government job growth since at the time she was discussing federal spending. Final thoughts: We ran Hutchison’s statement by a couple of experts before we received backup information from the senator. Noting Hutchison’s use of the word "sector" in her CNBC statement, Cheryl Abbot, a BLS economist in Dallas, suggested we compare the data on overall government employment with how other industry groups performed, rather than simply looking at the private sector as a whole. Of eight BLS sector categories, we found five whose payrolls grew over the last two years: mining and logging, professional and business services, education and health services, leisure and hospitality, and "other," which includes laundry services and membership associations, among others. Abbot and economist Lisa Mataloni of the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis, each noted that Hutchison didn’t use the word "jobs" in her remarks on CNBC and suggested that the senator's statement could be interpreted as about something else altogether. Mataloni pointed us to a data source — "real gross value added by sector" — that essentially measures, in dollars, how much an industry or a sector contributes to gross domestic product, itself a measure of the country's output of goods and services. The change in GDP from quarter to quarter is how the government quantifies the growth of the economy. The most recent two years' worth of data, from the last quarter of 2008 to the last quarter of 2010, show the contributions of both the business and government sectors as increasing between those quarters. All told, we see no reason to penalize Hutchison for failing to say that job gains (and losses) were the basis of her growth claim or failing to specify that by "government," she meant "federal." But she relied on an outdated report speaking to a three-year, not two-year, period. Over the two-year period that she noted, the federal government was not the only growth sector. Private-sector employment also increased. We rate her statement False.	None	Kay Bailey Hutchison	None	None	None	2011-07-22T06:00:00	2011-06-29	['United_States']
pomt-05137	"70 percent of the people who voted" on June 5, 2012, "just didn’t feel comfortable with the recall of the governor," weakening any idea that Wisconsin is "fully behind this Walker agenda."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jun/22/peter-barca/barca-says-voters-arent-fully-behind-walker-70-per/	In the wake of the failed effort to unseat Gov. Scott Walker at mid-term, top Wisconsin Democrats insisted the June 5, 2012, election results were not an endorsement of the Republican governor’s political agenda. At the party’s convention, Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca, D-Kenosha, put it this way: "The GOP is engaging in pure folly if they misread this election to think that the electorate of Wisconsin is fully behind this Walker agenda," Barca said. "Because 70 percent of the people who voted just didn’t feel comfortable with the recall of the governor." He added: "After all, Wisconsinites are sort of forgiving people and fair minded people. And I guess they felt when Gov. Walker said, if they gave him another chance he’d do things differently, that he’d build a consensus and work for bipartisanship." Before the recall rancor recedes into history, let’s look at how voters viewed the recall and what it says about support for Walker’s policies. To recall or not to recall Wisconsinites’ qualms about recalls were evident early on. In a January 2012 poll Marquette University Law School, more than 40 percent said recalls should only be allowed in cases of criminal wrongdoing by an officeholder. By June, after the recall, another MU poll found 50 percent support for that. On election day, widely cited exit poll results by Edison Research addressed head-on the question of the legitimacy of the recall. The firm asked 1,224 voters statewide when recalls are appropriate. --10 percent said recalls never should happen. --60 percent said recalls should only occur for official misconduct. --27 percent said they should happen "for any reason." Those results show a large majority who felt the recall was inappropriate to the circumstances, at least if you read "official misconduct" as some kind of civil or criminal charges by the person being recalled Barca added the first two results and got the 70 percent figure he cited in his remarks, Eric Greenfield, a Barca legislative office spokesman, told us. So, the numbers add up. But is it a fair reading of the exit polls that 70 percent "didn’t feel comfortable" with the recall? Charles Franklin, a political scientist who directs the Marquette poll, told us Barca’s comment stands up based on the exit polls. Since Walker has not been charged with official misconduct, it’s reasonable to lump the 60 percent in with the 10 percent "never" group as people who were not comfortable with the circumstances under which this recall was held, Franklin said. David Wegge, executive director of the Strategic Research Institute at St. Norbert College, agreed. "Not comfortable" may actually understate the intensity of the anti-recall feeling, Wegge said. The institute polls regularly on politics and other state issues. The Walker agenda But there’s another aspect to Barca’s remarks. He cited the 70 percent to bolster the notion that support for Walker’s agenda is softer than it may appear from the 53 percent majority Walker rang up compared to 46 percent for Barrett. Franklin and Wegge both said it’s really hard -- if not impossible -- to prove that from the available exit polling data. Indeed, it’s clear from the exit polls both Walker and Barrett got a large number of votes from people who seemed to think the recall was inappropriate. Nearly 95 percent of Walker supporters said recalls should never occur or only be for official misconduct. For Barrett, 42 percent of his backers felt that way. But that doesn’t tell us how many of the recall skeptics disagreed with Walker’s policies but voted for him anyway to somehow make a statement that the recall itself was inappropriate. There is one hint in the exits -- from a question on whether voters approved of Walker’s limits on collective bargaining by public employees. Ten percent of those who disagreed with Walker on that issue nevertheless voted for Walker. And there was an equal, opposite effect: 10 percent of those who approved of the union limits nonetheless voted for Barrett. (Overall on that question, the result closely mirrored the election: 52 percent approved and 47 percent disapproved.) Our rating Barca asserted that "70 percent of the people who voted just didn’t feel comfortable with the recall of the governor" weakening the notion Wisconsin is "fully behind" Walker’s policy agenda. Barca reasonable constructs the figure from a widely cited exit poll. Given the negative attitudes toward the recall election, he’s on safe ground. But there’s not enough information to judge the piece of Barca’s statement about the meaning of the anti-recall sentiments. And the exit poll question that comes closest provides murky results at best. We rate his claim Half True.	None	Peter Barca	None	None	None	2012-06-22T09:00:00	2012-06-08	['Wisconsin']

pomt-13455	"My opponent has no child care plan."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/14/donald-trump/trump-claim-Hillary-Clinton-has-no-child-ca/	In a Sept. 13 campaign event in Aston, Pa., Donald Trump unveiled a new, multi-pronged child care agenda. Trump’s plan would exclude child care costs up to age 13 from the federal income tax, including costs for both stay-at-home family members and paid caregivers. Those who don’t pay income taxes would be eligible to wipe out 50 percent of one parent’s payroll taxes through the earned income tax credit. Trump would also allow dependent-care savings accounts with a 50 percent government match on some contributions, as well as six weeks of paid leave for new mothers. But Trump didn’t stop with his policy offering. Trump accused Clinton -- who started her career at the Children’s Defense Fund and who’s considered child care a signature issue of her political career -- of not having any proposals for parents worried about their child care challenges. "While critical, meaningful policy work has been done in this area, my opponent has no child care plan," Trump said. "She never will. They'll never evolve into a plan. They'll never get done anyway." Trump wasn’t the only member of his campaign to make this point. His daughter Ivanka -- who became the first person involved in the campaign to publicly focus on child care policy when she gave an address at the Republican National Convention -- echoed that point in an interview with Fox News’ Megyn Kelly. "There’s no policy on Hillary Clinton’s website pertaining to any of these issues -- child care, elder care, or maternity leave or paternity leave, for that matter," Ivanka Trump said. Ivanka Trump was incorrect about elder care policy not being on Clinton’s website (it’s here) and also wrong about parental leave being absent (it’s here). But since the candidate himself specifically mentioned "child care," we’ll focus on that in this fact-check. Fairly quickly, we found two headings on the issues page of Clinton’s website that seemed to address the question -- one labeled paid family and medical leave and the other titled early childhood education. When we asked the Trump campaign to reconcile these headings with his comment, they responded that those two topics are separate and distinct from "child care." The campaign argued that "child care" refers to ages 0 to 4 -- before "early childhood education" begins at age 4 with preschool. The campaign also said that paid maternity leave is a policy area that’s separate from child care policy. Alan Viard, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who was cited favorably in Trump’s policy proposal, said he has "never before heard of ‘child care’ being defined as limited to ages 0 to 4." He added that the Trump campaign’s decision to include children up to age 13 suggests that "the campaign does not itself define child care in that odd manner." Still, let’s set aside whether the Trump campaign’s definitions are widely accepted. Instead, let’s use the campaign’s definition to see whether Clinton really has no policies relating to child care for those age 0 to 4. As long as you look deeper than the section headings on her website, Clinton does have policies addressing that age range. Specifically, she says: • "No family in America (should have to) pay more than 10 percent of its income to afford high-quality child care," a goal to be accomplished by "by significantly increasing the federal government’s investment in child care subsidies and providing tax relief for the cost of child care to working families." • "Double our investment in Early Head Start and the Early Head Start–Child Care Partnership program." (Early Head Start serves infants, toddlers, and pregnant women.) • "Award scholarships of up to $1,500 per year to help as many as 1 million student parents afford high-quality child care." • "Hillary will work to dramatically increase access to child care on campus by increasing funding for campus-based child care centers." So there are policies on Clinton’s website that address child care for ages 0 to 4. The Trump campaign didn’t respond after we forwarded them these examples. Viard agreed that the Clinton campaign "clearly has proposals for many aspects of child care, as commonly defined, and even under the odd 0 to 4 definition. Her 10 percent plan would apply to children in that age range, as well as to older children, and Early Head Start is targeted to children under the age of 3." Our ruling Trump said that "my opponent has no child care plan." Even under the campaign’s unusual, age-related definition of policies for children aged 0 to 4, Clinton has several policies to offer on her website. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-01089	Says Mitch McConnell credits Republicans "for recent economic improvements" even though they took control of the Senate only "days ago."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jan/14/gwen-moore/us-rep-gwen-moore-ridicules-mitch-mcconnell-credit/	On Jan. 9, 2015, two days after a new Congress was sworn in, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore tweaked new Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell with this tweet: "McConnell credits @GOP for recent econ improvements despite just gaining Senate control days ago. #RevisionistHistory" Sounds pretty silly. An economic recovery occurring just because Republicans took over the Senate days earlier? So, did the Kentucky Republican really say what the Milwaukee Democrat said he did? Just about. McConnell’s claim Moore reacted to comments McConnell made two days earlier on the Senate floor, after he took over as majority leader: "After so many years of sluggish growth, we’re finally starting to see some economic data that can provide a glimmer of hope. The uptick appears to coincide with the biggest political change of the Obama administration’s long tenure in Washington: the expectation of a new Republican Congress." So, McConnell was saying a recent economic uptick appears to "coincide" with "the expectation of a new Republican Congress." PolitiFact National rated that McConnell claim False, even leaving aside the question of whether McConnell was crediting the GOP for the uptick. Key statistics show the recovery was under way well before September 2014. That’s when a consensus emerged expecting that Republicans would win enough seats in the November 2014 elections to win a majority in the Senate. Moore’s claim Moore’s characterization of McConnell’s remark went a bit further. She said McConnell was crediting the GOP for a recovery because it had taken control of the Senate "days ago." But that expectation would have been in place a couple of months earlier, following the elections -- or perhaps a couple of months before that, as it became clear the GOP would win back the Senate. Our rating Moore said McConnell credits Republicans "for recent economic improvements" even though they took control of the Senate only "days ago." McConnell did say the recovery coincided with the expectation of the GOP taking over the Senate. But that expectation was months earlier, not days. We rate Moore’s statement Mostly True.

(Rod) Blagojevich cannot be an effective representative of the people of Illinois and, as we have said, will not be seated." — Statement from U.S. Senate Democratic Caucus headed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Dec. 30, 2008 " We have spoken to Mr. Burris to let him know that he is now the senator-designate from Illinois and as such, will be accorded all the rights and privileges of a senator-elect. “We congratulate Senator-designee Burris on his appointment, and we look forward to working with him in the 111th Congress.” — Statement from Reid and Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, Jan. 13, 2009 So how did embattled Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich’s pick to fill Barack Obama’s vacated Senate seat go from — in Reid’s words — a “tainted appointment” to one welcomed to the Senate as a “colleague and a friend"? Suffice to say some things changed in the two weeks between these statements. The first statement came as Blagojevich defiantly appointed Burris, despite charges that the governor had attempted to trade the appointment for personal gain. Although there was no suggestion that Burris was ever involved in Blagojevich’s scheme, Senate Democratic leaders headed by Reid considered any appointment from Blagojevich “tainted” and vowed to block it. Reid explained the Senate Democrats’ initial hard line in a news conference on Jan. 7. “The reason Barack Obama joined with us in the first letter and certainly the statements made subsequent to that, that this nomination is tainted, because if you know anything about this, it doesn’t look very good. “Blagojevich, who was arrested at his home, going to work one morning, for trying to sell the office. We’ve seen, time and time again, in print and before the electronic media, the crude language of Blagojevich, saying this is an ‘effin gold mine, I’ve got to get anything I can out of it.’ “How are we supposed to react? We reacted in a very reasonable way.” But cracks in Reid’s seemingly entrenched stance began to appear just days after the first statement. In a Meet the Press interview on Jan. 4, host David Gregory asked if there weren’t “room here to negotiate and actually seat Burris.” Reid responded, “I’m an old trial lawyer. There’s always room to negotiate.” Legally, a few things fell Burris’ way. For one, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that the appointment was valid. Another hurdle was cleared when Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White wrote a letter validating the appointment. Senate Democratic leaders had initially pinned some of their legal opposition to the Burris appointment on the fact that White had not signed off on the appointment. In addition, Burris appeared before the Illinois House Committee on Impeachment and testified that he had never offered Blogojevich anything in return for his appointment. Senate Democratic leaders also found themselves facing mounting pressure from other Democrats, particularly the Congressional Black Caucus, to seat Burris. Senate Democratic leadership relented and eventually backed Burris. He was sworn in on Jan. 15, and, like Obama was, will be the only African-American serving in the U.S. Senate. “There are many paths to the United States Senate,” Reid said from the floor on Jan. 15. “It is fair to say that the path that brought our new colleague from Illinois to us was unique. "Senator Burris, on behalf of all senators, we welcome you as a colleague and a friend." Whether political pressure, a realization of legal inevitability or the change in Burris' credentials was the tipping point, the fact is that Reid and other Senate Democratic leaders drew a line in the sand and then, two weeks later, did an about-face. Think of it this way: Who wants to bet Republicans won’t use video clips of Reid’s earlier statements when the Burris seat comes up for election in 2010? We call Reid’s position a Full Flop.

pomt-11992	North Korea is "the fifth or fourth most sanctioned nation."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/27/cory-gardner/north-korea-4th-most-sanctioned-nation/	Amid a war of words between the United States and North Korea, Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., took to the Sunday shows to argue Washington should apply more pressure to Pyongyang. While the United States has recently dialed up sanctions against Kim Jong Un’s regime, Gardner argued they could go further. "(North Korea) is now the fifth or fourth most sanctioned nation," Gardner said, "meaning that we have a long ways to go to continue to ratchet up the economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea and the enablers of North Korea." We decided to investigate how sanctions against North Korea compare with those targeting other countries. Rankings based on Office of Foreign Assets Control list An aide to Gardner pointed us to a chart from a recent paper by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. That paper, which was presented before Congress, ranks North Korea as the fourth most sanctioned country, behind Ukraine/Russia, Syria and Iran, respectively. Rankings were derived by comparing countries according to the number of sanctioned people and entities tracked by the Treasury Department. That sanctions list is officially known as the Office of Foreign Assets Control Specially Designated Nationals list, or OFAC list. It’s important to note that the data in the chart below was current as of Aug. 29, 2017, so it doesn’t include more recent sanctions. Gardner cited the above data not only to drive home his point that North Korea could be more heavily sanctioned, but also to show the impact of legislation he backed, the North Korea Policy Sanctions Enhancement Act, which took effect Feb. 18, 2016. "Last year, when Congress passed my legislation, North Korea was the eighth most sanctioned nation on Earth," Gardner said. "As a result of that legislation, it's now the fifth or fourth most sanctioned nation, meaning that we have a long ways to go to continue to ratchet up the economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea and the enablers of North Korea." (Note: We’re interested here in U.S. sanctions, not sanctions imposed by other countries.) We asked the Treasury Department whether the rankings were accurate but did not receive a reply by publication time. The limits of the OFAC list-as-ranking Even if you assume the raw numbers are correct, several experts we spoke to thought this approach to country rankings was problematic—though some allowed that a more far-reaching measurement would be tough to calculate. Experts’ main objection was that ranking countries based solely on the quantity of sanctions wouldn’t necessarily capture the quality, or impact, of sanctions. "Gauging how tough sanctions are is not simply a count of measures taken, but what share of economic activity they are covering, how willing other states are to implement them, and the related ability of the country to circumvent them through evasion," said Stephan Haggard, a professor of Korea-Pacific Studies at the University of California-San Diego. Joseph deThomas, professor of international affairs at Penn State University, said that while there is "no perfect method" for setting up a ranking system of this kind, basing it on the quantity of sanctions alone misses the mark. He suggested taking into account "the amount of financial, economic or national security pain inflicted on the sanctioned country." "Is a country with a lot of people banned from getting visas more sanctioned than one that has one sanction on its Central Bank that denies it access to the dollar?" DeThomas said. "Not likely." We reached out to Anthony Ruggiero, who authored the Foundation for Defense of Democracies paper, who argued the quantitative approach illuminates several key points about North Korea, relative to other sanctioned countries. He also emphasized the importance of reading the qualitative discussion of North Korean sanctions elsewhere in the paper. "This approach verifies North Korea is not the most sanctioned county in the world, and provides a pathway toward further invest of additional sanctions against North Korea and its facilitators," he said. Some experts acknowledged the difficulty of carrying out a more holistic approach. "As you can imagine, such a modeling exercise is really, really hard, and a count of measures is not going to do the work," Haggard said. Marcus Noland of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said there are better ways of assessing sanctions impact, "but they require actual time, effort, and modeling, and honestly there isn’t much of a market for comparative sanctions analysis." Our ruling Gardner said, "(North Korea) is now the fifth or fourth most sanctioned nation." A paper by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies ranks North Korea as the fourth most sanctioned country, behind Ukraine/Russia, Syria and Iran, respectively. According to the paper’s author, rankings were based on the Treasury Department’s list of sanctioned people and entities. The Treasury Department did not confirm the rankings. However, experts we spoke to said ranking countries based solely on its number of sanctions was problematic because numbers alone wouldn’t necessarily capture the total impact of sanctions.

pomt-08401	"Rick Perry has become a millionaire on the public payroll."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/oct/22/bill-white/bill-white-says-gov-rick-perry-became-millionaire-/	This year's Democratic gubernatorial nominee, whose campaign is called "Bill White for Texas," has latched onto the idea that GOP Gov. Rick Perry is for ... Rick Perry. "Rick Perry has become a millionaire on the public payroll," the narrator says in a TV ad that was posted on YouTube Oct. 4. "He's a career politician who's taken a government check for 25 years, and today, he's a millionaire." The words "Murky land deal mark Gov. Rick Perry's past" and "Gov. Perry wealth fueled by land deals" appear on the screen. It's not novel for White to niggle Perry about his wealth; he earlier zeroed in on the governor living in a posh rental home while the Governor's Mansion is repaired. But we haven't yet explored White's claim that Perry's gotten rich while a state official. Some background: White is correct that Perry has been in elected office 25 years. He was elected as a Democrat to the Texas House in 1984 and after switching parties was elected state agriculture commissioner in 1990 and then lieutenant governor in 1998. He succeeded Gov. George W. Bush, who was elected president, in late 2000 and was elected twice to that office in his own right. As of January 2010, Perry had been in one state office or another for more than 25 years. He's seeking his third full term as governor. While working for the state, Perry's pay has increased from $7,200 a year while serving as a legislator to $150,000 annually, according to a September 2009 story in the Associated Press. According to Perry's 2009 income tax return, he and Anita reported an adjusted gross income of $200,370. But income doesn't factor into this millionaire equation. White's campaign told us it gauges Perry's 'millionaire' status based on his net worth — his assets minus his liabilities. Not that there's anything wrong with personal wealth, White would likely say. As of April 30, the market value of White's liquid net worth — cash, publicly-traded stocks and mutual funds — was approximately $2.7 million, according to a comparison by the White campaign of White's and Perry's publicly disclosed financial information. Additional assets include IRA accounts with about $2 million invested in common stocks and mutual funds. In 2009, White, and his wife Andrea, reported $659,762 in adjusted gross income, according to their income tax return for that year. To back up White's claim about Perry becoming a millionaire while working for taxpayers, White spokeswoman Katy Bacon pointed us to a Sept. 26, 2009 AP news story cited in the ad. "Gov. Rick Perry never had much money growing up," the story says, "and he has spent most of his adult life in public office, drawing a part-time salary as a legislator and relatively modest earnings in statewide office for the last quarter century. But thanks to his investments and a series of private land deals, some that took advantage of his political connections, Perry has squeaked over the millionaire line." According to Perry's 1984 financial statement, he had at least $28,000 in assets and at least $15,000 in liabilities — a net worth of $13,000. According to the AP, which analyzed 18 years worth of Perry's public financial records with the help of Houston accountant Bob Martin, some real estate investments were extremely rewarding for Perry. Most recently, in 2007, Perry sold lakefront Horseshoe Bay property he'd acquired in 2001 for $1.4 million, making a profit of $823,766. In their federal tax filing covering 2007, Perry and his wife, Anita, reported $1.09 million in adjusted gross income. The year before, they reported $204,065 in adjusted gross income. Martin told us that the money Perry has made on real estate transactions alone most likely propelled his net worth past $1 million. According to the AP, the blind trust has produced at least $600,000 in income since 1997. Perry's income tax returns also show that the trust posted a loss of about $567,000 in 2008, according to a Sept. 2 story in the Austin American-Statesman. Martin told us that loss probably resulted from Perry bailing out of the stock market when the economy soured. But it's difficult to know precisely how much Perry is worth because he, like some other elected officials, keeps his financial holdings in a blind trust he established in 1996. Under a 2003 state law, officeholders are not supposed to know what the trust holds or what assets are acquired or disposed of — those decisions are left to a trustee, whom the elected official selects. His 2009 financial statement only reveals that the blind trust is worth $25,000 or more — the highest value bracket on the form. Allison Castle, a spokeswoman in the governor's office, said that as of August 2009, Perry's blind trust was worth $896,000, according to several news stories. We sought up-to-date information from the governor on his assets and liabilities but didn't hear back. In analyzing Perry's income tax returns and financial statements, which list Perry's assets and liabilities that aren't in the blind trust in a value bracket, Martin told us that he used the lowest possible value of each asset, minus the lowest possible value of each liability. The net worth: about $1 million, including the value of the blind trust. According to Perry's 2009 financial statement, he earned at least $10,000 from an investment partnership he owns with his father, and the house the Perrys owned in College Station was appraised at $243,900 last year, according to the Brazos County Appraisal District. According to the county website, the house deed passed to new owners on Feb. 5, 2010. He earned at least $2,000 in rent from tenants living in his College Station house, and had at least $70,000 in liabilities, including a car loan for a Mercedes-Benz. Not disclosed: the value of his retirement fund, often a big component of one's asset mix. Perry hasn't released that figure but if he were to retire at the end of this term, he could receive as much as $86,250 per year in state retirement. Or, he could choose to receive a check for up to 36 months of his standard pension as a lump sum worth $258,750 before taxes. (His future pension payments would be permanently reduced after that.) Our calculation: In 2009, Perry's net worth was at least $1,081,900. Perry's assets totalled $1,151,900 (at least $10,000 from investments, $243,900 from his house, at least $2,000 in rent from tenants living in his College Station house and $896,000 from his blind trust, as of August 2009). His liabilities amounted to at least $70,000 in personal notes. Martin said that nothing in the Perrys' 2009 tax return suggests that his net worth dropped below $1 milllion, but the lack of public information about his blind trust makes it impossible to tell for sure. And that's the hitch in White's claim. Since Perry's financial holdings are not public, much is unknown. Still, available records lead us to conclude the governor was worth about $1 million in 2009. He was worth far less before he entered state office. We rate White's statement Mostly True.	None	Bill White	None	None	None	2010-10-22T06:00:00	2010-10-04	['None']

pomt-03587	Says Kelly Ayotte voted to "fix background checks."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/15/reclaim-america-pac/pac-ad-says-kelly-ayotte-voted-fix-background-chec/	New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte saw her poll numbers drop after she voted against a proposal to expand background checks on gun sales. Now coming to her rescue is Marco Rubio’s Reclaim America PAC. The Florida senator’s group is out with an ad that says Ayotte "voted to fix background checks." What gives? Did she vote against them or vote to fix them? The answer depends on how you define the fix. Gun control groups say background checks won’t be fixed unless they are expanded to cover more types of gun sales. The bill Ayotte voted for did not do that, but it would have added more records to the database used to run background checks in hopes of keeping guns from criminals and the mentally ill. Let's explore. Manchin-Toomey amendment The background check amendment, sponsored by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., was a compromise intended to replace stricter language in Majority Leader Harry Reid’s Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013. Current law requires checks on purchases only from federally licensed gun dealers. Reid’s bill would have expanded them to all transfers, even private ones among family members, with few exceptions. The Manchin-Toomey amendment attempted to find middle ground -- expanding the checks to gun shows and Internet sales, but not requiring them of family members and friends giving or selling guns to each other. Ayotte joined Republican colleagues in a mostly partisan vote, defeating the measure 54-46. (Procedurally, the amendment needed 60 votes to pass). Ayotte, in declaring opposition to the measure, said: "I believe that restricting the rights of law-abiding gun owners will not prevent a deranged individual or criminal from obtaining and misusing firearms to commit violence. While steps must be taken to improve the existing background check system, I will not support the Manchin-Toomey legislation, which I believe would place unnecessary burdens on law-abiding gun owners and allow for potential overreach by the federal government into private gun sales." The Republican alternative The same day as the vote on Manchin-Toomey, Republican Sens. Charles Grassley of Iowa and Ted Cruz of Texas introduced a substitute amendment. Like Manchin-Toomey, that amendment won a majority of votes (52-48), but not the needed 60. The Grassley amendment would have provided incentives for states to submit relevant mental health records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and required federal courts to do so. It also would have allocated money for prosecuting violations of the background check requirement. But it did not expand the requirement to cover any new firearms sales, such as at gun shows or over the Internet. (Editor's note: We looked more into the details of the Grassley amendment after we published this report. See our story for a more detailed discussion on the how the amendment would have worked.) Eight senators ended up voting in favor of both background check measures. In an op-ed several weeks after the votes, Ayotte said Manchin-Toomey would have expanded "the broken background check system we have now." "In my view, we shouldn’t be expanding a flawed system. The focus should be on fixing the existing system, which criminals are flouting. We need to make sure we are enforcing current law and prosecuting those who attempt to illegally obtain firearms," she wrote. "And we must ensure that NICS includes records currently not being entered in the system, including mental health adjudications where an individual is found to be a danger to themselves and others." Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a pro gun-control organization founded by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, said the amendment Ayotte supported did "nothing to close the gaping loophole that allows criminals to buy guns without background checks." Our ruling The PAC ad said Ayotte voted to "fix background checks." But we found differing opinions on what would actually fix the system. Reclaim America’s evidence is her support for a measure that would have put more records into the instant criminal check system, with the aim of capturing more people whose gun applications should be rejected. But to many in the gun-control debate, fixing background checks means requiring them on firearms bought at gun shows and over the Internet. The ad, as you might expect, only portrays one side of the background check debate. The other side could reasonably argue that Ayotte stood in the way of fixing the loopholes in background checks. On balance, we rate the statement Half True. Update: After this story was published, we looked into more details about the Grassley amendment and how it would have worked, specifically the incentives to states to send mental health records to the federal background check database. We published our additional findings in this story. The ruling on this fact-check remains the same.	None	Reclaim America PAC	None	None	None	2013-05-15T17:01:43	2013-05-14	['None']
pomt-11857	"With this plan, the typical family of four will save $1,182 a year on their taxes."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/03/paul-ryan/would-house-gop-tax-plan-save-typical-family-1182/	In unveiling the House Republicans’ tax bill, Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., touted its positive impact for a typical American family. "With this plan, the typical family of four will save $1,182 a year on their taxes," Ryan said Nov. 2. This amount is more than two-thirds lower than what the White House earlier said before the details of the House proposal were hammered out -- that "the average American family would get a $4,000 raise under the President’s tax cut plan." We have urged skepticism about the $4,000 figure. But what about the $1,182 figure? When we took a closer look at the math, we found that it leaves out some important qualifiers. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com How the House math figure works The House Ways and Means Committee calculated several scenarios for how the proposal’s changes could affect different types of taxpayers. The key elements in this calculation involve tax brackets, the standard deduction and the child tax credit. Currently, there are seven brackets; these would be consolidated into four -- 12 percent (up from 10 percent today), 25 percent, 35 percent, and 39.6 percent. In the meantime, the standard deduction will be raised from $12,000 to $24,000. And the child tax credit will be increased from $1,000 to $1,600, bolstered by a new $300 credit for parents and other dependents. The example Ryan highlighted refers to a "family of four making $59,000 per year." Here’s the scenario outlined in the House’s fact sheet, using the fictional example of "Steve and Melinda" with two middle school-aged children: "As a result of lower tax rates, a significantly larger standard deduction, and an enhanced Child Tax Credit and Family Flexibility Credit, Steve and Melinda will pay over $1,182 less in taxes than last year, reducing their total tax bill from $1,582 to only $400. "That’s more money they can use for whatever is important to them, whether it’s paying bills, purchasing a new refrigerator, or putting away savings for the future." The Ways and Means Committee, answering questions for Ryan’s office, said they chose a household income of $59,000 because it’s the median household income nationally. For that amount of income, a family today would get $12,700 from the standard deduction, $16,200 in personal exemptions, leaving $30,100 in taxable income. Of that, $18,650 would be taxed at 10 percent and $11,450 would be taxed at 15 percent, meaning the preliminary tax liability would be $3,582.50. That would be adjusted with $2,000 in child tax credits, producing a final tax liability of $1,582.50. Under the new tax bill, the family would take a larger $24,000 standard deduction (the proposal eliminates personal exemptions), leaving $35,000 in taxable income. At the 12 percent rate, that would mean $4,200 in preliminary liability. This would be offset by $3,200 in child tax credits and $600 in family credits, leaving a final tax liability of $400. That’s a $1,182.50 tax cut. So Ryan has some mathematical detail to back up the figure. But it leaves out at least three caveats. The median household income is $59,000, but the median family income is almost $73,000: The Ways and Means Committee used the figure for median household income, but Ryan referred to the "typical family of four." The major difference is that households can include one person living alone, whereas a family is a group of two or more people related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together. So among families, a $59,000 income is not necessarily "typical" -- it’s actually in the bottom half of the income spectrum. The last time the median family income was as low as $59,000 was in 1985. On the other hand, Ryan's office notes that if you calculate the impact the same way for a family that earns $73,000, the savings are actually higher, at $1,602. Your mileage may vary: The GOP bill eliminates or shrinks a number of widely used itemized deductions, and those factors aren’t taken into account in the figure Ryan cited. The deductions eliminated or pared back in the bill include the mortgage interest deduction (for future mortgages, it would be capped at half its previous maximum); the state and local tax deduction (only $10,000 in property tax deductions would be allowed); the medical expense deduction; the casualty loss deduction; and the student loan interest deduction. Exchanging these changes for a higher standard deduction may benefit many taxpayers, particularly those who choose not to itemize today. But some taxpayers who depend on these itemized deductions today may end up worse off if the bill is passed as is, even with the higher standard deduction. For this type of taxpayer, the loss of even one of those deductions could conceivably wipe out that $1,182 gain for certain types of families. This specific amount of tax savings is good for just the first year: The benefits for this family shrink, slowly but surely, over the next decade. "The tax cut definitely dissipates over time," David Kamin, a tax and budget specialist at the New York University law school, told PolitiFact. Kamin cited a combination of factors, including the sunsetting of the $300 per parent tax credit; the lack of inflation adjustments for the child tax credit, which effectively replace personal exemptions that were indexed to inflation; and the new use of an inflation adjustment measure known as chained CPI, which grows more slowly than the yardstick in current use. According to Kamin’s calculations, the initial tax cut for the family making $59,000 becomes a $500 tax increase by 2024 compared to the status quo. Here’s the graph he put together: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Ryan said, "With this plan, the typical family of four will save $1,182 a year on their taxes." This is based on a plausible and transparent calculation, but Ryan glosses over some context. The calculation doesn’t factor in several itemized deductions that would disappear under the proposal and that could have a significant impact on at least some "typical" families around that income level. And Ryan’s statement is misleading when he says the family will save "$1,182 a year," since that’s the case in the first year only; after that, the benefit starts to shrink and eventually turns into a tax hike. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-15256	Planned Parenthood is "the only health care that a significant number of women get. About 30 percent of women, that's their health care."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/31/harry-reid/harry-reid-says-30-women-rely-only-planned-parenth/	An anti-abortion group recently released several secretly recorded videos of Planned Parenthood employees discussing fetal tissue, and that has given opponents of the abortion-providing health organization new momentum to shut off federal funding. During Senate floor debate on July 29, 2015, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., urged lawmakers to focus on consequences for women who rely on Planned Parenthood for health care beyond abortions if the federal funding is cut off. Planned Parenthood "is the health care backbone for American women during their lives," Reid said. "In fact, it's the only health care that a significant number of women get. About 30 percent of women, that's their health care." A reader thought that number sounded high and asked us to check it out. We started by doing some basic math. According to the 2013 Census Bureau population estimate, there were about 161 million women in the United States, of whom 131 million were age 15 or over -- the primary constituency for Planned Parenthood. Thirty percent of that number is about 39 million women. Did Planned Parenthood serve 39 million women who had no other health care options? Not even close. According to the most recent Planned Parenthood annual report, the organization saw 2.7 million patients in 2013, completing 10.6 million separate procedures. The biggest categories of procedures were sexually transmitted infection tests (3.7 million), reversible contraception (2.1 million), emergency contraception kits (1.4 million), pregnancy tests (1.1 million), and HIV tests (704,000). (For the record, the group disclosed that it performed 327,653 abortions during that period, or about 3 percent of all procedures.) Equally problematic, there's no indication in Planned Parenthood’s data that each of the 2.7 million patients had no other health care resources to rely on, as Reid said was the case. When we checked with Reid’s office, a spokesman said that the senator was speaking off the cuff and had meant to refer to a different statistic. That is a statistic -- often cited by Planned Parenthood itself -- is that "one in five American women has chosen Planned Parenthood for health care at least once in her life." But that’s not what Reid said. Our ruling Reid said Planned Parenthood is "the only health care that a significant number of women get. About 30 percent of women, that's their health care." That’s not the case -- Planned Parenthood saw 2.7 million patients in 2013, not the 39 million it would have needed to see for Reid’s claim to be accurate. Even if every Planned Parenthood patient had no other health care options, the group would have seen about 2 percent of women, not 30 percent.

pomt-00957	The Department of Homeland Security is "the only federal department not funded for this entire fiscal year" by Congress.	true	/texas/statements/2015/feb/18/lloyd-doggett/lloyd-doggett-says-homeland-security-only-us-agenc/	In a commentary, U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Austin criticized border-security legislation advanced by a fellow U.S. House member at a time that funding for the Department of Homeland Security seems stand-alone shaky. Doggett, a Democrat, said the Border Security Results Act offered by Austin’s Michael McCaul, the Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, was premised on the unattainable goal of no unauthorized border crossers, making for a border tighter than that of North Korea. Moreover, Doggett wrote in his article posted online Jan. 26, 2015, by the Austin American-Statesman: "Our border security is being further undermined by Republican limitations on DHS law enforcement funding. This is the only federal department not funded for this entire fiscal year. Uncertain stop-and-start, short-term appropriations weaken the ability to plan at a time of heightened international security concerns." We think of Uncle Sam as gigantic, sprawling, multi-digited. Is Homeland Security all alone in going unfunded through the fiscal year running through September 2015? Doggett’s factual backup By email, Doggett spokeswoman Leslie Tisdale cited a Dec. 10, 2014, Congressional Quarterly news story referring to 11 spending measures that had made it through Congress with only a "continuing resolution" approved to maintain Homeland Security funding for a few months. And on Dec. 16, 2014, she noted, the White House announced President Barack Obama had signed into law the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2015, "which provides fiscal year 2015 full-year appropriations through September 30, 2015, for all agencies except the Department of Homeland Security, for which appropriations are provided instead through February 27, 2015." Congressional actions Then again, news accounts suggest there’s room for Homeland Security funding to be worked out. In early 2015, the Republican-majority House advanced a measure funding Homeland Security through the fiscal year. A Jan. 9, 2015, press release from the House Appropriations Committee said the fiscal 2015 Homeland Security funding measure, described as the "last of the 12 annual funding bills to be considered," included $39.7 billion in discretionary funding, an increase of $400 million compared with what lawmakers ponied up the previous year. Under the proposal, funding would flow to Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Transportation Security Administration, cybersecurity, the Coast Guard, the Secret Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the release said. But the appropriation had a catch. Five days later, the House voted mostly along party lines to tie the funding to reversing Obama’s immigration actions, though news accounts said it was unlikely sufficient senators would agree to the linkage and even if that improbably happened, Obama would veto the measure. "House approval of the spending bill was just the opening act in a debate expected to stretch into late February, when funding for the Department of Homeland Security is set to expire," the Washington Post reported. A Jan. 15, 2015, New York Times news story hinted the issue would be worked out. "Because Republicans have said that they will use the $40 billion funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security as their vehicle for dismantling" Obama’s immigration actions, the story said, "Congress faces another deadline that seems likely to force an accommodation before the department's money is due to run out at the end of February." "One disagreement Republicans will have to work out is how far they are willing to go to push legislation that has no chance of becoming law--because it dies either in the Senate or in a presidential veto," the Times story said. "It is clear that some House Republicans want--and expect--the Senate to be as unyielding as they have been, though that is not likely. Asked how far he was willing to go, Rep. Trent Franks of Arizona said, '’All the way to where we fail to override.’" "If the feud lingers beyond Feb. 27 with no compromise and Homeland Security funding runs out," the Times’ story said, "millions of federal employees within the department's vast bureaucracy will have to work without pay. Around 85 percent of the department is classified as ‘essential’ and must report to work regardless of whether their agency is effectively shut down. This includes Border Patrol agents and Transportation Security Administration screeners," the story said. We asked Homeland Security if more details had been revealed about what happens after Feb. 27 and didn’t draw any. Independent confirmation Separately, a budget expert told us Doggett got it right. By email to our inquiry, Jack Deutsch of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonprofit committed to educating the public about issues with significant fiscal policy impact, said that one of its policy advisers, Ed Lorenzen, noted that at the end of 2014, Congress passed legislation, referred to as the CRomnibus, providing funding for all federal agencies except Homeland Security for all of fiscal 2015 "but only continuing funding for the Homeland Security appropriations through Feb. 27." Our ruling Doggett said Homeland Security is "the only federal department not funded for the entire year" by Congress. That was so as of when Doggett spoke in January 2015. Congressional Republicans were attempting to tie funding through the fiscal year to a repeal of Obama’s 2014 announcement the administration intended to shield some unauthorized immigrants from deportation.

pomt-01320	"$2.4 million of the NIH dollars was spent on ‘origami’ condoms."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2014/oct/27/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-nih-spent-24-million-origami-condom/	During a recent visit to Virginia, U.S. Sen. Rand Paul took exception to claims that budget cuts have hurt the National Institute of Health’s efforts to find a cure for Ebola. The Kentucky Republican was the headliner at an Oct. 15 rally in Ashland for Dave Brat, the GOP nominee for the 7th District congressional seat. Paul, a Tea Party favorite, said NIH has money to waste. "Do you know what the NIH spends money on?" he asked the crowd. Paul listed a series of NIH projects he viewed as profligate. "$2.4 million of the NIH dollars was spent on ‘origami’ condoms," he said. "This is a family crowd, so I’m not getting into what that means." But we will. We wondered if his claim is correct. Origami is the Japanese art of folding paper to form animals, flowers and other designs, according to Webster’s New World College Dictionary. We struggled to imagine how this centuries-old craft might improve the condom. Paul’s office backed the senator’s statement by sending us several articles about NIH’s funding of condom research, the earliest one published by the Washington Free Beacon this March. Turns out, there’s a California company, named ORIGAMI, that’s vowing to reinvent the condom, a contraceptive that many men don’t like. The company believes the popularity of condoms -- which must be unrolled and are typically made of latex -- would greatly improve if they were more pleasing, less cumbersome and safer to use. ORIGAMI is developing condom with accordion-like pleats. They’re made of silicone and, because they’re loose-fitting and don’t have to be unrolled, can be put on faster than traditional condoms. The company is seeking FDA approval and hopes sell its product next year. A number of global health organizations are encouraging condom research and development, convinced that greater use of devices will lead to fewer unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases such as AIDs. Since 2006, NIH has awarded seven grants totaling almost $2.5 million to help develop male and female ORIGAMI condoms. The money was provided to Strata Various, a product design firm headed by Danny Resnic, ORIGAMI’s founder. Resnic is listed on the grant documents as the project leader of the research. ORIGAMI’s work has been praised by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which last year handed out $1.1 million in grants other entrepreneurs seeking to improve condoms. The Foundation said ORIGAMI "provides an excellent example of a private enterprise focused on new condom design to promote consistent use by emphasizing the sexual experience." Now, let’s return to Paul’s speech. The senator, in lamenting the use of public funds to develop "origami’ condoms," never defined the difference between the folded paper art and the name of a company. We asked Brian Darling, a spokesman for Paul, whether his boss was referring to Origami with a capital "O," meaning the company, or a small "o," meaning the art form. "The senator’s words speak for themselves," Darling replied in an email. "I don’t understand the confusion." The day before he appeared in Ashland, Paul spelled origami with a small "o" in Facebook post and a tweet assailing NIH’s spending. "NIH blames tightening federal budget for its inability to produce #Ebolavaccine, but somehow found $2.4 million to develop 'origami' condoms designed with Japanese folding paper in mind," Paul wrote on his Facebook page. He tweeted, "@NIH cant afford #Ebola vaccine bc of 'budget cuts' but can spend $2.4 mill to develop 'origami' condoms #Priorities http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-" So what does the company have to say about all this? Mark Bardwell, an ORIGAMI spokesman, defended the grants, saying they are given out "based on scientific merit." "Condoms are considered a medical device. As such, it must pass FDA safety testing standards through clinical trials that are very expensive," Bardwell said. "An innovation condom could take 3-4 years and several million dollars for R&D and human testing." Our ruling In trying to document waste at NIH, Paul said the health agency spent $2.4 million on "origami" condoms. Paul didn’t provide any more information in his speech, leaving the crowd to wonder whether tax dollars are going to the development of paper condoms folded into fancy shapes. What he didn’t say is that ORIGAMI is the name of a company that has received the NIH grants to develop an improved condom that is made of silicone and has fold-out pleats. NIH has long encouraged condom use to reduce unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. We don’t find much fault with Paul, however. The company, by its very name, suggests the principles of origami drive its design. So we rate Paul’s claim Mostly True.	None	Rand Paul	None	None	None	2014-10-27T06:00:00	2014-10-15	['None']
pomt-07973	"Ben Franklin once quipped that only two things in life were certain: death and taxes. I think even he didn't envision that the tax man would visit on the day of your death."	false	/ohio/statements/2011/jan/21/jay-hottinger/rep-jay-hottingers-assessment-founding-father-unfo/	None of the Founding Fathers is more quotable than Benjamin Franklin. Arguably the greatest mind of the founding generation, he was a printer, journalist, scientist, inventor, financial thinker, statesman, diplomat and musician -- among other things. His range of interests and prolific writing over his 84 years produced a shelf of memorable maxims, thoughts and observations. One of the most famous was quoted in the Ohio House of Representatives when Republicans introduced a plan to repeal the state's estate tax. "Ben Franklin once quipped that only two things in life were certain: death and taxes," said Rep. Jay Hottinger, a Republican from Newark. "I think even he didn't envision that the tax man would visit on the day of your death -- and that's something that needs to end here in the state of Ohio." PolitiFact Ohio was intrigued, mostly because we wondered if there really was anything that Franklin could not envision. So in a week where we marked the 305th anniversary of Franklin’s birth (Jan. 17, 1706), we looked to see what history might reveal. Ohio wasn’t yet a state during Franklin’s lifetime. The federal estate tax wasn’t enacted until 1916, during the Progressive Era, partly as a way to break up large accumulations of wealth. Inheritance taxes, levied on those who receive property from an estate, were imposed as an emergency revenue measure three times before that. The first was in 1797, the same year that Thomas Paine’s essay "Agrarian Justice" was published. In the essay, Franklin's friend and protege proposed creating a sort of national social security fund, financed by a 10 percent tax on inherited property. Franklin died in 1790, but "Agrarian Justice" does contain echoes of his writing. In a letter to Robert Morris in 1783, Franklin wrote about the right of the public to regulate property passing to heirs: "All Property, indeed, except the Savage's temporary Cabin, his Bow, his Matchcoat, and other little Acquisitions, absolutely necessary for his Subsistence, seems to me to be the Creature of public Convention. Hence the Public has the Right of Regulating Descents, and all other Conveyances of Property, and even of limiting the Quantity and the Uses of it." Basic property necessary for man to live should be left alone, Franklin wrote. But he continued that "all Property superfluous to such purposes is the Property of the Publick, who, by their Laws, have created it, and who may therefore by other Laws dispose of it, whenever the Welfare of the Publick shall demand such Disposition." We thought one sentence has particular relevant here: "Hence the Public has the Right of Regulating Descents, and all other Conveyances of Property, and even of limiting the Quantity and the Uses of it." In the book "Wealth and Our Commonwealth," William H. Gates Sr. and Chuck Collins write: "The nation’s founders and populace viewed excessive concentrations of wealth as incompatible with the ideals of the new nation. Revolutionary era visitors to Europe, including Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine, John Adams, and Ben Franklin, were aghast at the wide disparities of wealth and poverty they observed. They surmised that these great European inequalities were the result of an aristocratic system of land transfers, hereditary political power, and monopoly." If you Google "death and taxes," you'll find Franklin's quote cited frequently in arguments against the estate tax, often called the "death tax" by opponents. Franklin, 83 and ailing, made the quip to friend Jean Baptiste Le Roy, a French physicist, in one of the letters whose tone Isaacson calls "inappropriately lighthearted." Franklin wrote: "Our new Constitution is now established, and has an appearance that promises permanency; but in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes." We sought further guidance from Franklin authority Dr. Michael Zuckerman, professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania, which Franklin founded. There is "nothing whatever in that quote pertinent to estate taxes," he responded. But Franklin, he told us, did not view taxes negatively. Rather, Zuckerman said, he was "mistrustful of great wealth, and quite supportive of inheritance taxes." Even today, the "tax man" does not literally "visit on the day of your death," and we take Rep. Hottinger's quip as a figurative expression for the reality of a tax being imposed on the deceased person's estate. And that, he said, was something Franklin likely couldn’t envision. But to the contrary, biographers, historians and even Franklin’s own writings suggest pretty clearly that it was a concept he would have supported. For that reason, we rate the statement as False.

pomt-14541	Says Jeb Bush "said he would take his pants off and moon everybody ... Nobody reports that."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/feb/14/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-jeb-bush-said-he-would-moon-ever/	Jeb Bush took Donald Trump to task over the language he has used on the campaign trail in a Republican debate in South Carolina. That included Trump’s comments about women and Sen. John McCain, as well as an accusation that he mocked a disabled reporter who has a physical impairment, which Trump denied. Trump fired back that Bush has been a potty mouth but has gotten away with it. "Two days ago, he said he would take his pants off and moon everybody," Trump said Feb. 13. "And that's fine -- nobody reports that. He gets up and says that. And then he tells me that, oh, my language was a little bit rough." Did Bush really say such a thing, and did the press ignore it? Trump’s recounting of the facts is pretty selective. Bush’s comment about mooning Trump’s spokeswoman referred us to a a Feb. 6 article by Matt Viser in the Boston Globe a few days before the New Hampshire primary. The main point of the article was that Bush had to do well in New Hampshire -- or later this month in South Carolina -- or he would face pressure to end his campaign. "Sitting on his campaign bus — laptop, turkey jerky, and coffee all nearby — Jeb Bush was befuddled over his campaign’s failure to capture more attention from the news media. "I could drop my pants," he said in an interview. "Moon the whole crowd. Everybody would be aghast, except the press guys would never notice." So it was actually Bush who suggested -- in jest here -- to the Boston Globe reporter that he could even pull down his pants and moon people and he still would get no media attention. It’s fair to say that Bush was exaggerating here to make a point about the lack of media coverage he was getting. And Bush made that point to a reporter from a major publication. And that reporter led with it in an article three days before the primary. Trump’s comments made it sound like Bush was threatening to moon people, and that’s not the case. Bush’s quote at the time was repeated on various blogs on the Internet, and The Drudge Report posted it on Facebook. Our ruling Trump said that Bush "said he would take his pants off and moon everybody ... Nobody reports that." Bush did talk about mooning people. The Boston Globe reported on Feb. 6 that Bush said, "I could drop my pants. Moon the whole crowd. Everybody would be aghast, except the press guys would never notice." Bush’s comment to the reporter was intended to show how he felt he was getting no campaign coverage. But Trump’s statement is misleading, because Bush wasn’t threatening to moon people, and his comment was indeed reported. The statement has an element of truth but ignores critical context. So we rate it Mostly False.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-02-14T00:57:29	2016-02-14	['None']
abbc-00246	Social Services Minister Christian Porter says the Government has been reining in the Newstart program, the main form of income support for jobseekers.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-17/fact-check-newstart-labor-coalition-spending/9111150	Mr Porter's claim is spin. A Fact Check analysis of departmental annual reports shows that over six Labor budget years Newstart spending increased at an annual average pace of 13.8 per cent, compared with 3.5 per cent so far under the Coalition. This more or less accords with Mr Porter's figures. However, it is a stretch for Mr Porter to suggest that in contrast to Labor's "massive failure" the difference reflects the Coalition's very hard work. Rather, as experts contacted by Fact Check noted, the rise in Newstart spending under Labor initially reflected a rise in unemployment linked to the Global Financial Crisis — a factor beyond the Australian government's control — and later was affected by policy decisions designed to save the budget money, including shifting tens of thousands of single parents from the Parenting Payment (single) to the less generous Newstart. As experts have noted, this led to lower spending on the Parenting Payment (single) allowance, but higher spending on Newstart. The net result was a substantial saving to the budget. In addition, there is no evidence to show that people have been making the transition from Newstart to employment more quickly under the Coalition. The latest Department of Social Services figures show that Newstart recipients are exiting the payment at a slower rate than they were in any of Labor's six budget years.

pomt-05359	Georgia crackdown on illegal immigration costs state farmers $400 million last year.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2012/may/11/charlie-flemming/immigration-bill-cost-georgia-farmers-close-400-mi/	Georgia labor leader Charlie Flemming took the microphone at a May 1 rally at the state Capitol to talk about the challenges facing working people around the world and ended up taking on the state’s new immigration law. "I was trying to stay away from that," Flemming said. But concerns about HB 87 -- Georgia’s immigration law -- were too hot a topic not to mention, he said. A Morris News Service article about the rally attributed to him a claim that the legislation cost farmers $400 million last year. "I said, ‘close to $400 million,’ " said Flemming, president of the Georgia AFL-CIO. Flemming said he got the number from an Oct. 4 article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which itself was based on a University of Georgia study commissioned by the Georgia Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association. It’s a pretty big number and raises a couple of questions: Is the number right and are the losses attributable to the new immigration bill? We tracked down report co-author John McKissick, a UGA distinguished professor of agriculture marketing emeritus, to explain the report. McKissick said he and co-author Sharon Kane surveyed 189 farmers representing nearly half the state’s acreage for seven fruit and vegetable crops about their labor troubles during last spring’s harvest. The crops -- including blueberries, onions and watermelons -- were chosen because they are "most dependent on timely seasonal harvest." The results showed an acute labor shortage cost those farmers just under $75 million. Since the sample size was so large -- 46.4 percent of the state’s total acreage in those crops -- McKissick said it is fair to project the direct cost to farmers was about $140 million. The report couches that conclusion because responses to the survey were voluntary, but McKissick feels confident the projection is valid. "It wasn’t a random survey," he said. "But you rarely ever get a survey that covers that amount of acreage." So, if the impact to farmers was $140 million, where did Flemming get his figure? Along with the direct impact on farmers, the UGA report projected an indirect impact of the lost harvest on the rest of the state’s economy. Truck drivers, grocery store workers, even accountants get hurt indirectly when crops don’t get to market, McKissick said. The report calculated both the direct (to the farmers) and indirect (to the rest of us) impacts of the labor shortage to be $391 million. That’s the "close to $400 million" that Flemming got from the AJC article he scanned on his way to the rally. For the record, the AJC article reported the projected loss was for the entire state economy, not just farmers. Flemming said he may have misread the story before speaking, but he said the larger point remains. "It was a significant hit for our state," he said. "This law has cost the state a lot of money. It’s hurt and is continuing to hurt." That’s the second question: Is HB 87 the culprit? The UGA report is based on losses from the spring harvest -- which is the largest and most significant harvest in the state for fruits and veggies. But HB 87 did not take effect until July 1, so how could it have caused the shortage? That’s conjecture, McKissick said, but it is not that hard to make the connection. "The bill had been passed, but even though it had not gone into effect, it created an atmosphere where people had a lot of questions," he said. The report itself does not draw that conclusion, but McKissick said both the labor shortage and legislative promises to crack down on illegal immigrants occurred simultaneously. A follow-up study has not been done, but McKissick said he expects the economic ripples will continue as farmers cut back on their spring crop acreage. "We did ask in the survey whether or not the results of the labor shortage would impact their production decisions for the fall and the following year’s crop," he said. "There was a good number that said it would affect their decisions, so there probably is a multiyear impact." So Flemming was wrong in attributing the entire loss to farmers, but he was in the neighborhood when he said agricultural losses were about $400 million if you count indirect losses. It is impossible to say with absolute certainty that HB 87 caused the labor problem, although McKissick and others believe the two are linked. There are a couple of problems with Flemming’s statement. It’s not completely clear that HB 87 is responsible for all of the farm losses. But even if it is, the amount of those losses if far less than he stated. There’s a kernel of truth to what he said. But just a kernel. That’s fits our definition of Mostly False.

pomt-11563	"There was no requirement to put in affordable housing."	true	/illinois/statements/2018/feb/06/chris-kennedy/did-chris-kennedy-need-add-affordable-housing-his-/	Democratic governor candidate Chris Kennedy stoked controversy recently by accusing Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel of pushing policies that priced low-income minority residents out of the city. But Kennedy then found himself attacked for hypocrisy by one of his rivals in the governor’s race. State Sen. Daniel Biss of Evanston claimed Kennedy, a developer, had skirted city affordable housing requirements at Wolf Point West, a downtown luxury high-rise in which Kennedy controls a key stake. In response, Kennedy told Chicago Sun-Times columnist Mary Mitchell, "there was no requirement to put in affordable housing," saying the Wolf Point property was zoned in 1973, decades before the city implemented its affordable housing ordinance. "It is nearly impossible when a building is 70 stories tall to create affordable housing because the construction cost itself is probably three times more expensive," Kennedy also said. "We created a river walk. We created a public park. We did all the things that would make us good neighbors and good corporate citizens." Chicago’s affordable housing ordinance wasn’t enacted until 2003, 30 years after the land was initially zoned, so Kennedy’s claim he was under no legal mandate makes sense on its face. But the property remained largely undeveloped for those 30 years and its zoning was amended by the city in 2013 before construction began on the tower. That made us wonder, could the zoning amendment have triggered requirements to set aside some units for affordable housing? And even if not, is creating affordable housing really as cost-prohibitive as Kennedy says? We decided to take a deeper look. Checking boxes The land on which the Wolf Point tower stands, purchased by Kennedy’s wealthy investor grandfather in the 1940s, was originally zoned in 1973 as Kennedy said. In the intervening years, the property at the intersection of the Chicago River’s three branches near the Merchandise Mart long was used as a parking facility before plans for the tower got off the ground in 2013. If Wolf Point was beholden to affordable housing requirements, it would have fallen under the city’s 2007 Affordable Requirements Ordinance, which expanded the original 2003 plan. Under the 2007 guidelines, new developments with ten or more residential units were required to designate 10 percent of those units as affordable housing or else cough up $100,000 per required unit for the city’s affordable housing fund. An existing development could have also triggered those requirements by requesting a zoning change that would have increased its density or permitted residential units on a property where such units were not previously allowed. In 2013, the Chicago City Council amended the zoning plan for the Wolf Point development. Even so, Kennedy’s campaign said the affordable housing rules didn’t apply to Wolf Point because the zoning update did not alter the floor area ratio or character of the development laid out for the property in 1973. "Since none of those types of changes were being requested, the 2007 ordinance was not required to be adhered to," Kennedy spokeswoman Rebecca Evans said in an email. She referred us to public zoning records, which show the use of the land today falls in line with the 1973 zoning. We ran Evans’ assessment by the city’s Department of Planning and Development, which confirmed that the Wolf Point property, by not deviating from its 1973 zoning outline, was grandfathered out of current affordable housing mandates. Being neighborly Even though Kennedy and his Wolf Point partners faced no legal obligation to add affordable housing, it’s also worth noting in light of his complaints about Emanuel that nothing stopped them from doing it voluntarily. Developers of similar upscale projects that are subject to the affordable housing mandate have found ways to make compliance economically feasible. For example, officials at the city Department of Planning and Development pointed to recently approved plans for a 1,011-foot high-rise called One Square Chicago across the street from Holy Name Cathedral. It must adhere to an expanded set of city affordable housing requirements approved in 2015. Under that mandate, One Square Chicago’s developers plan to rehab 22 units at a cost of $277,000 apiece inside the nearby Lawson House YMCA, a longtime single-room-occupancy residence in a historic art deco building. They’ll also be required to pay an additional $11.37 million into the city affordable housing fund. The glaring difference between One Square Chicago and Wolf Point, of course, is that developers of the new building had no choice but to comply with the affordable housing requirement, unlike Kennedy and his partners. Still, Kennedy has cast himself as an affordability advocate, ringing in the new year by alleging, without proof, that the mayor was behind a "strategic gentrification plan" to push out of the city African-Americans and other minorities. Later, speaking at a debate in Carbondale on Jan. 30, Kennedy evoked the notion that candidates for office should be held accountable to more than just the letter of the law. "The truth is, just because you don’t break a law doesn’t mean you’re innocent, and we need to hold our elected officials to a higher standard," Kennedy told the audience after lashing out at one of his Democratic rivals. Our ruling Kennedy said, "there was no requirement to put in affordable housing" at his Wolf Point development because the property was grandfathered in under rules that applied before adoption of the city’s affordable housing ordinance. Public records show zoning changes made in 2013, before construction began, did not alter the development in ways that would have triggered the ordinance. And the city department charged with reviewing new projects confirmed that, because of its original zoning date, the development escapes requirements that apply to projects zoned more recently. Kennedy has made both Chicago affordability and holding candidates to higher standards cornerstones of his campaign. So his own actions are relevant to any exploration of the affordability question. Nevertheless, Kennedy is correct in stating no legal mandate required him to include affordable housing at his Wolf Point development. We rate his claim True.

pomt-04004	Tide gauges measuring sea level in Rhode Island since 1930 have risen "maybe about 10 inches since that time."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/feb/08/janet-freedman/rhode-island-coastal-resources-geologist-says-sea-/	Sandy, the so-called "superstorm" that struck the East Coast in October 2012, did more than produce massive damage. It also got a lot of people talking about climate change. Climate scientists say Earth is warming, and most say it’s due to polluting gases that trap heat in the atmosphere. Stronger storms are one predicted result. And scientists say the storms are going to be even more damaging because the excess heat will cause sea level to rise, both by a melting of the polar ice caps and because water expands as it warms. When Janet Freedman, a coastal geologist with Rhode Island's Coastal Resources Management Council, talked about the risk of coastal flooding during an appearance on WJAR-TV’s "10 News Conference," she said the local rise in sea level is pretty clear. The levels "have been rising," she said. "In Rhode Island we have two long-term tide gauges that have been measuring the sea level since 1930 and we've seen that they've risen maybe about 10 inches since that time. "But we anticipate that with global warming, that's going to be faster, it's going to accelerate. Most models show we'll see a foot of sea-level rise as early as 2030 but definitely 2050 we expect to see sea levels that are higher than they are now." PolitiFact doesn't rate predictions, so we focused on whether sea level has really risen about 10 inches over the past eight decades -- an average of 1.25 inches every 10 years. We contacted Freedman, who sent us to several sources. The Sea Levels Online website, part of the Tides & Currents portion of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration website, has data from tide gauges around the world. Selecting "Rhode Island" sends you to data from gauges in Newport and Providence. The Newport data show that from 1930 to 2006, the mean water level has risen by 2.58 millimeters -- about a tenth of an inch -- per year. Data that take the readings through 2011 show that the overall rate over that 81-year-period has actually increased to 2.70 mm/year. We calculate the rise from 1930 to 2012 to be 211.6 mm or 8.7 inches. That's not 10 inches, but Freedman said "maybe about." (It's also important to note that there is a margin of error in these numbers because they are averages based on readings that fluctuate due to waves, tides, winds and other factors. The average may be 8.7 inches but the real number could be as high as 9.3 inches or as low as 8.1 inches. The odds of it being outside this "confidence interval" during that period are 1 in 20.) The Providence tide gauge hasn't produced as much data. Records begin around 1940 and there is a large gap in the 1950s. But the overall rate as of 2011 is also lower: 2.19 mm per year. If we extrapolate that back to 1930 and forward to 2012, that's 179.6 mm or 7.1 inches since 1930. Although the margin of error could take it as high as 8.0 inches, somewhat further from 10 inches than the Newport data. We also contacted Jon Boothroyd of the University of Rhode Island, who is designated by the U.S. Geological Survey as the state geologist. He crunches the tide gauge numbers a bit differently, taking the monthly data and averaging it for a year. He has also included more recent data. His estimate: 269 mm per 100 years. Over 82 years, that would be 220.6 mm, which is 8.7 inches as well. (The range here is 9.4 inches to 7.9 inches.) However, Boothroyd said that if you look at the actual year-to-year annual readings from Newport between 1930 and 2011, the increase has been about 270 mm, or 10.6 inches. Boothroyd said he doesn't use the Providence tide gauge data because he had doubts about it -- the readings are too far off from the Newport readings. Sea level can fluctuate if land rises or falls, for example. But between Providence and Newport, "the bedrock and the conditions are so close to one another, it doesn't make sense why that rate of sea level rise is lower than it is in Newport," he said. The gauge in Providence "is on a pier, and I don't think the pilings on that pier are sunk to bedrock. So the pier could be slowly subsiding, but the gauge shows exactly the opposite. So I don't use that number because I can't understand it. It's a really sticky wicket." These days, satellites offer the best measurement of sea levels, and they do it every 10 days across most of the world, said Steven Nerem a climate researcher at the University of Colorado at Boulder. "The satellites are all referenced to Earth's geocenter, so our data are not affected by the land motion," he said. In addition, coastal temperatures, winds, the saltiness of the water, atmospheric pressure and ocean currents all have an effect on the height of the water at individual locations, which is why researchers have to use a global average and look at long-term trends. For example, when the Pacific warms during an El Nino, "you have more precipitation over the oceans than in the continents, and you get a short-term increase in sea level," said Nerem "When you have La Nina (Pacific cooling), you get more precipitation over the continents and the water gets stored there for some period of time, so you have a temporary lowering of sea level." According to the satellite data, available at the website sealevel.colorado.edu, the global sea level has risen by 3.2 mm per year since 1993. If you assume that the rise has been steady since 1930, that would translate to an average worldwide increase of 10.3 inches. (Range: 9.0 inches up to 11.6 inches.) Is the pace of sea level rise increasing? "That's the $10 million question," said Nerem. "Over the last 100 years there is a suggestion that there is a small acceleration. If you just look at the satellite data, we don't see an acceleration. So over the last 20 years, it may just be too small, given all this variability, to detect." Boothroyd, however, said, "There is some indication that worldwide sea level has risen at a faster rate since 1990. Our graph suggests that is true for Newport" citing the uptick in 2010 and 2011. Freedman said Boothroyd's numbers, which show a slightly higher annual increase, may be pointing to sea levels rising faster today. "This trend seems to suggest that we are seeing acceleration in sea level rise over the last 20 years, but because there is so much variability in sea levels we really need forty years of sea levels to say that with scientific certainty." Our ruling Janet Freedman, a geologist with Rhode Island's Coastal Resources Management Council, said, "In Rhode Island we have two long-term tide gauges that have been measuring the sea level since 1930 and we've seen that they've risen maybe about 10 inches since that time." Her "maybe about" phrase gives her some wiggle room. The long-term trend in Newport doesn't quite measure up to 10 inches. It's 8.7 inches. But the actual annual measurements at the beginning and end of that time period meet the truth test, mostly because of a steep -- and not explained -- increase over the last few years. The Providence tide gauge data, on the other hand, show a much smaller trend over that time period -- it would be just over 7 inches. Freedman's overarching point that sea levels have been rising is certainly true, and that's borne out by satellite data. Pinning down the actual size of the rise is as difficult as measuring the precise height of a wave. Because her statement is essentially on-target but needs clarification or additional perspective, we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-08538	Says "the headlines … tell the story" of how Walker has "mismanaged" Milwaukee County	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/03/tom-barrett/democratic-governor-candidate-tom-barrett-says-hea/	It may be a politician’s dream to determine the headlines that go on the front page of the morning newspaper. In a new attack ad, Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Tom Barrett makes it a reality, using purported replicas of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel to slam rival Republican Scott Walker for "mismanagement" of Milwaukee County. The 30-second TV spot offers a trifecta of complaints: wasted money, exploding debt and shoddy oversight of county operations. The ad aims to undercut a main Walker selling point -- his fiscal management as Milwaukee County executive. In the ad, the narrator declares "the headlines ... tell the story." But do they? Instead of using shots of actual newspapers, Barrett’s ad creates a computer-generated version of the Journal Sentinel’s front page and places various headlines at the top of the page -- regardless of where the stories actually appeared. There are a host of other tricks involved: Headlines and allegations are mismatched for effect and photos of Walker are added to amplify his role and responsibility in each item. In response, Walker has issued a statement saying he is "exploring legal action" based on the ad. The Journal Sentinel has complained to the Barrett campaign about the false and misleading headlines associated with its trademark, said Editor Martin Kaiser. In some cases, the Barrett claim made through the narrator may be correct, or partly so. But in this item we are evaluating the manner in which they are presented and whether the overall message -- that the headlines support the claims -- is accurate. The ad opens with a cut from a Walker TV ad. In it, Walker says: "It seems like every time I pick up a newspaper there’s another headline about our tax dollars being wasted." The first claim comes when the narrator steps in, saying: "No kidding, Scott Walker. You mismanaged Milwaukee County so badly, spending went up $400 million." As this is spoken, an image of a newspaper with the headline "Millions down the drain" appears on the screen. The headline is from a story that appeared on JSOnline.com on Feb. 14, 2009, and in the Journal Sentinel the next day, concerning fraud in the $340 million Wisconsin Shares program, the state’s child-care subsidy program. But Walker was not mentioned or pictured in the story. At the time, the county did run some aspects of the state program. But the story was about overpayments to child-care providers. Those payments are made by the state from federal funds, not from the county budget, according to County Auditor Jerome Heer and Lisa Jo Marks, former interim head of the county’s Health and Human Services Department. Under Walker, county spending has gone up more than $390 million, which approaches the $400 million cited in the ad. But as we noted when we reviewed a claim in an earlier Barrett ad about rising county spending, the bulk of the increase was due to the county taking in more state and federal dollars -- not due to budget increases by Walker. In fact, Democrats have complained for years that Walker has cut the budget too much. In any case, the presentation leaves the viewer with the impression the $400 million is what has "gone down the drain." The story did not say that. And the ad does not support that. In the second claim, the narrator declares: "County debt has skyrocketed 85 percent." As the allegation is made, viewers see a headline that reads: "Milwaukee County deficit projected at $6 million this year." The headline appeared on a story posted on JSOnline on May 20, 2010, but the date shown in the Barrett ad on the mock Journal Sentinel is June 22, 2010. The story appeared on page 3B, not the front page. Again, Walker’s picture is added, when it did not appear in print or online. In this case, Walker was part of the story, which looked at the projection at the time of how much of a deficit the county was facing in the 2010 budget. Walker and county supervisors are aiming to address that one-time deficit by making cuts to assure the budget finishes in the black. In any case, the annual deficit is much different than the debt, a measure of long-term obligations of the county. On this point, county debt has risen 85 percent under Walker, according to Cynthia Archer, the county’s director of administrative services. The major reason for the increase is that, in March 2009, the county issued $400 million in pension obligation bonds that are to be repaid over 25 years. While the bonds are a new debt, the obligation isn’t new -- the county already was on the hook to pay the future benefits. What’s more, the county didn’t simply borrow the money. The county took the $400 million and invested it as part of an effort to shore up the pension fund. The county ultimately could end up paying more, but in the first year the return on the investment was high enough that the county paid $8.5 million less in pension benefits than it would have without the approach. (We also covered pension-related claims in a review of another Barrett ad). Like the first claim, the headline does not support -- or even relate to -- the spoken claim. In the third claim, the narrator says: "And the state had to take over your welfare program thanks to all the money you wasted." The headline shown: "State takes over county’s public assistance program." Although Walker’s picture was not included with the story, the ad shows a jubilant Walker in front of an American flag. The headline is taken from an online version of a Journal Sentinel story that was posted Feb. 3, 2009. The story told about the state stripping Milwaukee County of its role in administering food aid, child care and medical assistance programs. The state said the move was prompted by years of county mismanagement. Walker contended that state underfunding over the years was a big contributor to the problems. Of the three claims, the link between the headline and the narration is closest to being on the mark -- though it presents a distorted view of how it appeared in print. "Walker’s right," the narrator concludes, "the headlines do tell the story. Scott Walker ... Can’t trust him with our money, can’t trust him to tell the truth." Phil Walzak, Barrett campaign spokesman, defended the ad's assertions of mismanagement and the specific claims. For instance, he said the "millions down the drain" story was relevant to Walker's record because the county was responsible for preventing fraud in the child-care program. Walzak said he couldn’t comment on the use of Journal Sentinel headlines because of legal issues. The ad, he said, is airing in "multiple markets," but not in the Milwaukee area at this time. The fact that the ad has not been posted with other ads on Barrett’s campaign website "is not by design," but because other material is being uploaded to the site, Walzak said. The ad will be posted soon, he said. Where does this leave us? In taking his swing at Walker, Barrett creates phony versions of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and trades on the newspaper’s credibility when he declares "the headlines … tell the story" of Walker’s mismanagement of the county. But the ad uses digital trickery to mix-and-match headlines, give stories greater emphasis than they originally received and to amplify Walker’s role in each by adding photos to the layout. In the art world, that would be considered forgery. There may be elements of truth to some of the claims in isolation, but the way they are presented give viewers a false impression of what happened, how it was covered and the role Walker played. We’ll make our ruling clear: Pants on Fire. (Note: As of Oct. 7, 2010, the Barrett campaign removed the video from YouTube.)	None	Tom Barrett	None	None	None	2010-10-03T09:00:00	2010-09-30	['None']

pomt-09329	"(Pete) Sessions has held at least two fundraisers at adult-themed clubs and made no apologies."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/apr/13/lone-star-project/lone-star-project-says-us-rep-pete-sessions-held-t/	Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, has been getting flak after the RNC reimbursed a staffer some $2,000 spent at a risque club in Los Angeles. So why, asks the Democrat-backing Lone Star Project, is U.S. Rep. Pete Sessions of Dallas, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, off the hook for "his fundraising at Las Vegas strip clubs?" The Lone Star Project is steered by Matt Angle, director of the Texas Democratic Trust and former aide to then-U.S. Rep. Martin Frost, D-Dallas, whom Sessions beat in 2004. On its Web site, the group says it's an arm of the Lone Star Fund political action committee, offering "political and legislative analysis to help individuals, organizations and the press see beyond the rhetoric and misinformation typically provided by the current Republican state leadership in Texas and Texas Republicans in Washington." "Sessions has held at least two fundraisers at adult-themed clubs and made no apologies," according to an April 8 press release from the group. In the wake of the RNC's recent brouhaha, we wondered if Angle & Company bared the truth about Sessions' events. As back-up to his claim, Angle pointed us to a video attached to the press release. The video, made and uploaded to YouTube this month by the Lone Star Project, shows scenes from Forty Deuce, a Las Vegas club where Sessions has previously confirmed he held an event in 2007 to raise money for his political committee, Pete PAC, which gives money to Republican political candidates. The PAC spent more than $5,000 to rent the club for the occasion, according to federal finance disclosures. Included with the video: A sound clip from the American Public Media radio show Marketplace. On the clip, Sessions says: "We do a Las Vegas fundraiser every year, and uh, not only raise money, but see Las Vegas. It's a beautiful town." Marketplace reporter Steve Henn replies: "Forty Deuce is a strip club." According to the clip, Sessions says: "You know, I've never seen that. It is what I would call a burlesque show, where there's a woman who comes out and has a dress on... uh, she never gets naked. There's no nudity, there's no nudity in there." According to an undated promotional advertisement for Forty Deuce, the club calls itself a "World-Famous Burlesque," with "striptease that is very empowering to women" and "appeals to both sexes." The original Forty Deuce opened in Los Angeles in 2002 and closed in 2008. The Las Vegas Forty Deuce venue in the Mandalay Bay casino was open from 2004 to 2007. Since 2008, the Forty Deuce show has played Friday nights at its new Hollywood venue. Lana Gates, events director for Forty Deuce and other Kane ventures, told us "there is no nudity in the show — it's a mix of sexiness and whimsy, pleasing to both genders." In the Marketplace segment, Kane offered this distinction about his burlesque shows: "The key component would be to have girls who were dancers taking their clothes off, not just girls taking their clothes off." Promotional video of Forty Deuce's scantily-clad dancers crawling across the floor and grinding on musicians indicated the show is adult-oriented, as the Lone Star Project says. Published reports reinforce that conclusion. In 2002, The New York Times wrote of the Forty Deuce in Los Angeles: "The dancer, Carolina Cerisola, gyrated and fox-trotted while peeling off her gown, a pair of long violet gloves and a pink bra. When she kicked off a pair of spangled black panties, they grazed the back of the bartender's head." And writing in The New York Times' travel section, Frommer's Travel Guides describes the Las Vegas joint as "the first establishment to cash in on the return of the high-class hoochie girl." Zagat, on its Web site, calls it "good for a bachelor party." Unnoted by the Lone Star Project: Sessions raised money for his leadership PAC, People for Enterprise, Trade and Economic Growth (PETE), at the Forty Deuce club before he was elected by House Republicans in November 2008 to lead the NRCC. So, unlike GOP chairman Steele, he did not yet hold a national party post. The second fundraiser cited by the Lone Star Project, also for Sessions' PAC, took place at Tao Las Vegas in February 2009. The Tao complex includes an Asian-cuisine restaurant, topless pool and nightclub (the club promises "a happy ending" on its Vegas billboards). The Washington Post reported that unnamed Republicans had said the 2009 fundraiser was held at Tao's restaurant, which, according to Restaurants & Institutions magazine, ranked as the highest-grossing independent restaurant in the United States — a title it still claims today. According to federal financial disclosures, Sessions' PAC spent about $4,390 on food and beverages at the restaurant. What we found: The restaurant is two floors down from Tao's nightclub, which has nearly nude dancers that restaurant patrons 21 and older can go upstairs to see. Pennapa Chutima, a hostess at the restaurant, said it's not adult-themed. She said: "It's a peaceful calm environment. Families are more than welcome. We are stroller-friendly." The city of Las Vegas classifies local clubs as topless clubs with liquor, adult night club establishments or as nightclubs. Tao's club — which doesn't have burlesque or striptease — is listed among nightclubs. Finally, we didn't find record of Sessions airing fundraising regrets. Neither Sessions nor his aides agreed to our requests for on-the-record interviews. The naked truth? All indications are that Sessions held one fundraiser in an adult-themed venue and another in a restaurant that's separated from its nightclub featuring nearly nude dancers. We rate the Lone Star Project's statement as Half True.	None	Lone Star Project	None	None	None	2010-04-13T16:54:47	2010-04-08	['None']
pomt-07716	DeKalb County has cut more money from its general fund budget "than any local government in the Atlanta metro region."	true	/georgia/statements/2011/mar/04/burrell-ellis/dekalb-ceo-says-he-wields-big-budget-ax/	DeKalb County Chief Executive Officer Burrell Ellis lost a recent battle with county commissioners on his proposal to raise property taxes to help balance the budget. The seven-member board chose instead to order an additional $33.6 million in cuts, insisting there’s more fat to be trimmed. Ellis and some DeKalb officials worry the additional cuts might take a toll on public safety in the county. Ellis vented. "We’ve cut $109 million. I think we’ve done more than any local government in the metro Atlanta region," he told reporters after the board’s vote on Feb. 22. The second part of that quote piqued our curiosity. Has DeKalb cut more than anyone else? DeKalb’s communications director, Burke Brennan, explained and offered a slight correction. Ellis was discussing how much money he and the commissioners have cut from DeKalb’s general fund budget -- which pays for police, fire rescue and most county services -- since he became CEO in January 2009. DeKalb’s budget was $636 million in 2008. With the additional cuts adopted by commissioners last month, the general fund budget is about $529 million, county officials say. That’s actually a $107 million decrease, Brennan said, not $109 million. There are 73 cities, counties and towns in the 10 counties that are part of the Atlanta Regional Commission. It didn’t seem fair to compare the budgets of, say, Clayton County’s Lake City (population 2,886) to DeKalb, which had a population of 747,274, according to the most recent U.S. census data. We decided, instead, to compare DeKalb to the similarly sized governments of Cobb, Fulton and Gwinnett counties and the city of Atlanta, which all have populations in excess of 500,000. DeKalb, Fulton and Gwinnett base their budgets on a calendar-year basis. Atlanta’s budget year begins each July 1 and ends June 30. Cobb’s budget year begins Oct. 1 and ends Sept. 30. We compared the last four budgets adopted by each government. In 2008, Fulton County’s general fund budget was nearly $671.5 million. The county’s budget has declined in each year to its 2011 budget of nearly $595 million. That’s an 11 percent decline of $76.5 million. Fulton officials told us they actually spent $35 million to $60 million less in 2008, 2009 and 2010. Gwinnett County’s general fund budget has gone up and down since 2008. In 2008, it was nearly $456 million. It rose to nearly $510 million in 2010. This year’s budget is $448.6 million, $7 million -- or 2 percent -- less than it was in 2008. Atlanta, like DeKalb, has cut its general fund budget significantly since 2008. The city budget was about $645 million in fiscal year 2008, which began July 1, 2007, and ended June 30, 2008. The city cut hundreds of jobs from the payroll in fiscal year 2009, resulting in a general fund budget of nearly $571 million. The current fiscal year budget, which ends June 30, is approximately $559 million. That’s an $86 million difference that is 13 percent lower than fiscal year 2008. Cobb County’s general fund budget for 2008 was nearly $338 million. The county’s general fund budget includes most of the same services as the others, but there are some differences. For example, a portion of the property taxes goes specifically to the fire department budget, which is about $65 million for the current fiscal year. The fiscal year budget for 2011 is $328 million, a 3 percent drop from FY 2008. Since 2008, the numbers show DeKalb has cut more money from its general budget than any of the governments its size. The $107 million DeKalb has cut amounts to a 17 percent decrease over that time span. That is a larger percentage than the other governments. It appears CEO Ellis is on the money with this claim. We rate his statement as True.	None	Burrell Ellis	None	None	None	2011-03-04T06:00:00	2011-02-22	['Atlanta', 'DeKalb_County,_Georgia']

pomt-12410	"If Donald Trump would stay home from Mar-a-Lago one weekend, it would pay the entire meals on wheels budget for the state of Missouri for almost two years."	false	/missouri/statements/2017/may/23/claire-mccaskill/false-mccaskill-says-1-mar-lago-trip-could-fund-mi/	Democrats are criticizing President Donald Trump for proposed budget cuts to social programs. They also aren’t happy how Trump often spends his weekends away from the White House visiting one of his properties. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., put the two criticisms together recently. "The thing that I'm most disappointed about so far, and this is a little thing, but Trump's budget cut the meals on wheels program. Completely, gone," McCaskill said at an April 14, 2017, town hall. "If we are not doing meals on wheels, it is cutting off our nose to spite our face, because the people who can't get nutrition at home and don’t stay well end up in a nursing home, and you end up paying the bill, so meals and wheels is a small investment," McCaskill said. "If Donald Trump would stay home from Mar-a-Lago one weekend, if he would stay home from Mar-a-Lago for one weekend, it would pay the entire meals and wheels budget for the state of Missouri for almost two years. One weekend." McCaskill continued. "So, if he -- he has not called me ever -- and there hasn't been a particular reach out to me ... but if he did, I would say you know what I would do if I were you, it'd be a really smart idea. I would announce on a Friday I'm not going to Mar-a-Lago, and this week I’m going to make sure that the money that we would've spent, the $3 million that we would've spent goes to the meals on wheels program in Tennessee or in Kansas, or in how about Missouri." Trump's budget proposal would cut $192 billion from federal nutritional assistance programs, the New York Times has reported. The question of this fact-check is: Would one fewer trip to Mar-a-Lago save Missouri's meals on wheels programs for two years? Trump’s Mar-a-Lago trips Pinning down the cost of a trip to Mar-a-Lago is difficult. As PolitiFact has previously reported, the closest thing we have is a 2016 Government Accountability Office report detailing the costs of a 2013 trip taken by President Barack Obama. The trip was four days from Chicago to Palm Beach, Fla., and cost $3.6 million. But the author of that report has said it should not be used to estimate the cost of Trump’s travel to Florida. "We wouldn’t recommend substituting the numbers from President Obama’s trip to any other trip," Brian Lepore, director of defense capabilities and management at GAO, told PolitiFact in April. (We rated a fact-check saying Trump's trips cost $3.6 million Half True.) When the president travels, generally several military aircraft are involved. These include Air Force One, carrying the president, his entourage and guests, cargo planes packing motorcade limousines and other equipment, and aircraft to transport personnel who conduct security sweeps before the president arrives. This is the main driver of presidential travel costs. Air Force One alone costs nearly $180,000 per hour of flight as of 2012, according to the Congressional Research Service. The GAO report found that total air and boat support accounted for more than 85 percent of the $3.6 million spent on Obama’s 2013 trip. But these costs change significantly from trip to trip, so it’s hard to nail down the average cost. For example, a president could take two identical weekend trips to Palm Beach, both trips requiring a C-130 Hercules transport aircraft. But one trip could cost a good deal more than the other depending on where the C-130 has to fly in from. Military logistics could mean that one week it comes from Delaware, the next from Texas. Or, if the president’s event schedule for one of the Palm Beach weekends requires a helicopter, an additional or bigger plane might be necessary to transport the helicopter. Another group has estimated Trump's trips to Florida have cost much less. Judicial Watch, a conservative group, said public records show that two Trump weekend Mar-a-Lago trips cost $1.28 million. The authority on the matter, the GAO, has accepted a request to examine the costs of Trump’s Mar-A-Lago trips. Unfortunately that report isn’t available yet. Missouri’s meals on wheels costs While there are difficulties estimating the cost of a trip to Mar-A-Lago, McCaskill’s bigger issue is with how she discussed Missouri's meals on wheels budget. Meals on wheels is a catch-all term for companies or organizations that provide nutrion assistance to low-income people, primarily seniors. Meals on Wheels is one specific organization that provides delivered meals, but it's only one. McCaskill spokeswoman Sarah Feldman said McCaskill was speaking specifically about one federal funding source, Community Development Block Grants. The block grants help fund nutrition assistance programs in five Missouri cities: St. Louis, St. Charles, St. Peters, St. Joseph and Independence. In fiscal year 2016, grants for home-delivered meals totaled $356,900. Spread over two years, that's a total of $713,800. What's not clear from McCaskill's comments, however, is that meals on wheels programs in Missouri include much larger funding streams. Jenny Bertolette, spokeswoman for Meals on Wheels America, said the main source of funding for meals on wheels is the Older Americans Act. That program provided about $10.5 million in federal funding for meal assistance in Missouri, according to a 2017 fact sheet (the figures are from 2014). That's way more -- in one year -- than any estimate for a Mar-a-Lago trip. And the Older Americans Act isn't the only source of funding. For instance, Meals on Wheels of Greater St. Louis, says it does not receive any government funding. Yet it spent nearly $340,000 in 2013 on program expenses, according to required government filings. Our ruling McCaskill said that if Trump stayed home from Mar-a-Lago for one weekend, then it would pay for the cost of meals on wheels in Missouri for two years. We don't know how much it costs for Trump to visit Mar-a-Lago for the weekend. A GAO report said it cost $3.6 million for Obama to take a four-day, two-city trip in 2013, but the author of that report said that figure should not be used to make other estimates. Another group pegged the cost much lower. More problematic, McCaskill only looked at Community Development Block Grants when considering the cost of home-delivered meal programs in Missouri. The comparison falls apart entirely when you look at a fuller set of funding streams. We rate this claim False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Update (5 p.m. May 23): This post was updated to include additional comments from McCaskill. The rating remains unchanged.

pomt-06535	"Today, you have six financial institutions, the largest six, that have assets that are the equivalent of 60 percent of the GDP of the United States of America."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/06/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-six-bank-companies-have-assets/	During an Oct. 4, 2011, interview on MSNBC, host Ed Schultz and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., discussed the "Occupy Wall Street" protests, which are targeting the financial services sector. Sanders offered a statistic designed to demonstrate the power of American banks. Sanders suggested that many of the protesters "have not seen the president be as strong as he should be on Wall Street," saying they want the federal government to take tougher measures against financial-services companies. "Ed, today, you have six financial institutions, the largest six, that have assets that are the equivalent of 60 percent of the GDP of the United States of America," Sanders said. (GDP stands for gross domestic product.) We wondered whether Sanders’ math was correct. When we contacted Sanders’ office, a spokesman provided testimony to a congressional oversight panel by Simon Johnson, a professor of entrepreneurship at the MIT Sloan School of Management. "Our six largest bank holding companies currently have assets valued at just over 63 percent of GDP," Johnson testified, citing figures for the fourth quarter of 2010. "This is up from around 55 percent of GDP before the crisis (e.g., 2006) and no more than 17 percent of GDP in 1995." We wanted to find the original statistics, and we located them in a chart posted by the National Information Center, the federal repository of data about banks and other institutions for which the Federal Reserve has a supervisory, regulatory or research interest. The chart lists the 50 biggest bank holding companies as of June 30, 2011. Here are the top six and their total assets: 1. Bank of America Corp., $2.264 trillion 2. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., $2.246 trillion 3. Citigroup Inc., $1.957 trillion 4. Wells Fargo & Co., $1.260 trillion 5. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., $937 billion 6. Morgan Stanley, $831 billion Together, the top six companies’ assets were $9.495 trillion. For the second part of the equation -- gross domestic product -- we turned to the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis. Though the time spans don’t line up perfectly, we decided to use the GDP figure for 2010, the most recent full year. That figure is $14.527 trillion. Dividing these top banks’ assets by the national GDP produces a result of 65 percent -- which is actually a slightly larger percentage than Sanders had indicated, but certainly in the ballpark. To make sure we weren’t missing something, we contacted a few experts on financial services issues. They offered a few caveats: • The comparison is a bit of apples vs. oranges. The banks’ asset figures are an aggregation measured at a single point in time, whereas the GDP figure is an aggregation of goods and services measured over time. "This distinction is the equivalent to a comparison of your net worth with your personal income," said Lawrence White, an economist at New York University’s Stern School of Business. "Economists generally don't find these sorts of comparisons very useful or interesting. So the best that can be said is that these comparisons provide a rough sense of comparative magnitudes." • The data are constantly moving. "Several of these banks, especially Bank of America, have lost significant" value since the figures were published in June 2011, said Satya Thallam, director of the Financial Markets Working Group at George Mason University's Mercatus Center. The denominator, GDP, is always changing, as well. So, any estimate is true for a specific point in time, but possibly out of date not long after it’s made. • Banks’ overseas holdings significantly complicate the comparison. For starters, the comparison Sanders is making doesn’t mean that these banks own 60 percent of the U.S. wealth, because some of these banks’ assets are in overseas holdings. However, Sanders appears to be on safe ground with his phrasing, since all he said was that the two dollar figures were "equivalent." Potentially more problematic for Sanders is that the assets-to-GDP ratio for the top six bank companies in the U.S. are actually quite modest when compared to the biggest banks in other nations. A 2010 study by J.P. Morgan listed the 25 biggest banks internationally in 2008, along with the percentages of their home country’s GDP. The highest was UBS, with 376 percent of Switzerland’s GDP. And six other banks all had assets as large as their home country’s GDP -- Credit Suisse Group of Switzerland (218 percent), Dexia of Belgium (180 percent), Fortis of the Netherlands (155 percent), Royal Bank of Scotland of the United Kingdom (131 percent), Barclays of the United Kingdom (112 percent) and BNP Paribas of France (101 percent). All of these dwarf the combined holdings of the top six banks in the U.S., in part because America’s GDP is so much larger than the GDP of these other nations. The significance of this fact for Sanders’ assertion, however, is less clear. "This doesn't tell us what is a ‘proper’ or ‘appropriate’ number," Thallam said. "One might reply that other countries are much more concentrated, but that only means they're worse -- not that we're in a good position." Some scholars, he added, have said that even at current concentration levels, U.S. banks should be broken up because they create a "too big to fail" problem. "On the other hand, people for years said that banking exhibited economies of scale, so consolidation was natural," Thallam said. Our ruling Sanders’ math is correct -- in fact, the percentage he offers is actually a little low. And he’s careful to say only that the banks’ assets are only "equivalent" to 60 percent of the United States’ GDP, not that the banks own 60 percent of the United States. Sanders doesn’t note that big banks in other countries are far bigger, compared to their nations’ GDP, than the U.S. banks are. Still, on balance, we rate his statement True.

pomt-04537	"The Doherty Campaign, unlike the Cicilline Campaign, is funded mostly by individual donors -- not the big PACs that Cicilline relies on."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/sep/30/brendan-doherty/brendan-doherty-says-most-david-cicilline-campaign/	Because candidates need money to pay staff and buy the advertisements designed to sway voters, it's not surprising that the source of those funds can be a matter of contention. Brendan Doherty, the Republican seeking to unseat Democratic U.S. Rep. David Cicilline, issued a news release Sept. 26 claiming that Cicilline is getting most of his money from large political action committees, not the individual donors that mark a grass-roots campaign. Here's the statement: "The Doherty Campaign, unlike the Cicilline Campaign, is funded mostly by individual donors -- not the big PACs that Cicilline relies on." To us, "mostly" means Cicilline is getting the majority -- more than half -- of his campaign funds from PACs. Because incumbents wield a lot of influence, especially members of Congress, it wouldn't be surprising if Cicilline was getting a lot of money from PACs, many of which are created by groups with specific agendas, such as businesses and labor unions. But we decided to check. Our quick go-to source for campaign finance information is OpenSecrets.org, the nonpartisan nonprofit website of the Center for Responsive Politics. Its latest tally for the Cicilline-Doherty race shows that as of Aug. 22, 2012, Cicilline had received $413,806 in PAC contributions versus $109,250 in PAC money raised by Doherty. That represents 24 percent of the money raised by Cicilline and 10 percent raised by Doherty. That's not a majority for either campaign. In fact, most of Cicilline's money -- 68 percent -- has come from large contributions (classified as donations of more than $200) from individual donors. An identical percentage -- 68 percent -- of Doherty's campaign funds also comes from large individual donations. If you add in the smaller contributions from individuals, Cicilline got 75 percent of his money from individuals compared to 86 percent for Doherty. We e-mailed the Doherty campaign Sept. 27 asking if they were using a different source for its claim. Spokesman Dave Layman focused on the OpenSecrets data we were looking at. "The point we were trying to make is that Mr. Doherty has a larger percentage of individual contributions and relies far less on PAC money," he said in an e-mail. "Perhaps, we should have said: 'Both campaigns rely mostly on individual contributions, but about a quarter of Mr. Cicilline’s campaign contributions ($413,806) come from PACs, whereas just 10% of Mr. Doherty’s campaign contributions ($109,250) come from PACs.' We should have made that clearer," Layman wrote. Our ruling Brendan Doherty said his campaign, "unlike the Cicilline Campaign, is funded mostly by individual donors -- not the big PACs that Cicilline relies on." Campaign finance data show that both campaigns are funded mostly by individual donors. Cicilline may have gotten more money from political action committees than Doherty has, but the scope -- 24 percent of $1.7 million raised -- doesn't even come close to supporting a statement suggesting that Cicilline is getting most of his funds from PACs. We rate Doherty's claim False. (Get updates from PolitiFact Rhode Island on Twitter: @politifactri. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)

pomt-00247	"Since passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Walmart 'increased their starting wage to $11/hr & has given about $400 million in bonuses.'"	true	/missouri/statements/2018/oct/05/ann-wagner/walmart-raised-wages-gave-bonuses-ann-wagner-claim/	With the 2018 midterms on the way, many Republicans are turning to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to bolster their campaigns. You can count Rep. Ann Wagner of Missouri’s 2nd Congressional District among them. On Aug. 27, Wagner tweeted, "The #TaxCutsandJobsAct is delivering real results. Since passage, @Walmart increased their starting wage to $11/hr & has given about $400 million in bonuses." We thought Wagner’s claim might be too large, so we decided to see if she was right. Good news from the boss In December 2017, President Donald Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law, restructuring tax laws for both private individuals and major corporations. The bill cuts corporate tax rates to 21 percent from the previous 35 percent. Republicans at the time said the move would almost double the standard deduction for citizens, would encourage investments and lead to overall economic growth. In January, Walmart President and CEO Doug McMillon announced in a blog post to employees the company’s plans due to the president’s tax overhaul. He said workers’ starting wages would be increased to $11. He also previewed bonuses to workers ineligible for the hourly wage increase that ranged from $200 to $1,000 depending on time spent within the company. "As you know, the president and Congress have approved a lower business tax rate," McMillon wrote. "Given these changes, we have an opportunity to accelerate a few pieces of our investment plan." Walmart was already planning these payments and could afford them before the tax reform, but the law fast-tracked the process. Wagner’s office linked us to a January CNBC article announcing Walmart planned to distribute these raises and bonuses and that the payments were projected to start the following month. The office also sent another article from the St. Louis Business Journal about a St. Louis Walmart receiving regular bonuses because of "their store’s performance the previous quarter." In its original announcement, Walmart said it planned to spend $400 million on one time bonuses. The company would not confirm the exact amount but said the number was close to its original projection. Justin Rushing, the director of corporate communications for Walmart, said "the raises went into effect on Feb. 17, and showed up on the paycheck our associates received on March 8. This is the same paycheck they all received their one-time bonus." Our ruling Wagner said that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was creating real results. "Since passage, @Walmart increased their starting wage to $11/hr & has given about $400 million in bonuses." Wagner is correct that Walmart made the payments and that it credited the legislation for the company’s actions. For this we rate Wagner’s claim True.

pomt-05062	"In the last 10 years, only one piece of legislation has been cosponsored and passed by" John Duncan Jr.	pants on fire!	/tennessee/statements/2012/jul/07/nick-ciparro/opponent-says-duncan-has-sponsored-piece-legislati/	U.S. Rep. John J. Duncan Jr., R-Knoxville, has been in Congress for nearly 2½ decades, so his voting record should be chock full of fodder for his political opponents to exploit. But one of his opponents in the 2012 primary, Republican Nick Ciparro of Knoxville, sees Duncan’s record as sorely lacking substance. "In the last 10 years, only one piece of legislation has been cosponsored and passed by Mr. Duncan Jr.," Ciparro wrote on his campaign website. Lawmakers routinely sign on as cosponsors of scores of bills, so it seemed doubtful to us that just one of the bills that Duncan has cosponsored in the past 10 years has become law. Ciparro backed off a bit when we asked him to back up that claim. What he meant, Ciparro said, was that Duncan has written just one bill over the past decade that has been signed into law. He has since changed his website to say that only one piece of legislation "has been written and passed" by Duncan. While recognizing that Ciparro adjusted the wording on his website, at PolitiFact we fact-check the original claim, not revisions made after a fact-based claim is questioned. Ciparro makes other claims about Duncan’s productivity on his website, but we wondered if he did overreach with the original claim about how much legislation had been "cosponsored and passed" by Duncan. Duncan’s spokesman, Patrick Newton, called Ciparro’s claim ridiculous and provided us with a list of bills that the congressman has authored and cosponsored over the past decade. Based upon that count, Duncan has cosponsored 334 bills since 2001. Seventy-three of those bills have become law. We did our own research using the Library of Congress’ Thomas online bill-tracking system. Our numbers were a little higher than those provided by the congressman’s office. According to our search, Duncan has sponsored or cosponsored 102 bills that have become law since 2001. Duncan’s office also points out, rightly so, that it can be misleading to judge a lawmaker’s productivity by the number of bills he has sponsored or cosponsored that have been signed into law. Both the House and the Senate often combine several pieces of legislation into one larger bill and then push the larger bill through the legislative process. So a measure that a congressman has championed could be attached to a larger bill and become law without the lawmaker’s name ever appearing anywhere on that legislation. In fact, one measure that took that route was a resolution that Duncan sponsored to name a veterans outpatient clinic in Knoxville after William C. Tallent, a World War II hero who also served as Knox County’s finance commissioner for 28 years. The resolution was enacted and eventually became law after it was included in a broader veterans appropriations bill. Duncan’s name does not appear on the final legislation, even though he introduced the original measure. It’s also worth noting that few bills ever become law. In the 111th Congress, which spanned the 2009 and 2010 calendar years, 13,683 measures were introduced in the House and Senate, yet only 385 of them became law, according to the Congressional Record. Our ruling The public record shows Rep. Duncan has sponsored or cosponsored at least six dozen bills that have been enacted into law over the past decade. At its best, Ciparro’s claim showed a basic lack of understanding of how Congress works. At its worst, it is a ridiculous distortion of the truth. We rate it Pants on Fire.

pomt-14576	In Virginia, "people are going and getting marriage licenses who are 12 and 13, and 14 and 15 years old."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2016/feb/08/jill-vogel/vogel-says-virginia-children-young-12-are-getting-/	State Sen. Jill Holtzman Vogel recently surprised her colleagues while pushing for a bill to prevent underage marriages. "People are going and getting marriage licenses who are 12 and 13, and 14 and 15 years old," Vogel, R-Fauquier, said during a Jan. 27 appearance before the Senate Courts of Justice Committee. We wondered if she was right. Virginia law now sets 16 as the minimum age for marriage, although exceptions are allowed in cases when a child is pregnant. Minors are required to get the consent of a parent or legal guardian before getting married. If they’re under 16, a marriage license is issued by a local circuit court clerk. Vogel co-sponsored a bill that would set the minimum marriage age at 18, unless a court has granted the minor the rights of an adult. Anyone seeking to go around the new age restriction by getting married out of state would face up to a $500 fine and up to six months in jail. She later amended the measure that lowered the allowed marriage age to 16 with no exceptions, even for pregnancy. Vogel said she was introducing the measure to stop situations in which young children are being coerced into marriage. "We are failing children miserably in Virginia," she told the committee. We asked Vogel’s office for the senator’s evidence that Virginians as young as 12 are getting married. Tricia Stiles, Vogel’s legislative assistant, directed us to the Tahirih Justice Center, a nonprofit focusing on violence against immigrant women and girls that researches underage marriage. The group, based in Falls Church, supports Vogel’s bill. Jeanne Smoot, senior counsel for the center, said the information came from a chart the group received last year from Virginia Department of Health showing the age of the youngest person married in Virginia each year from 2004 to 2013. The chart shows: • In 2004, 2006 and 2007, the youngest bride was 12. • In 2007 and 2010, the youngest groom was 12. • Throughout the 2004-13 span, there were Virginia brides and grooms ages 13, 14 and 15. We contacted the Department of Health to see if it could quantify the number of brides and grooms younger than 16. Maribeth Brewster, spokeswoman for the department, sent us some updated data on the number of marriages of children ages 12 to 14 from 2004 to 2014. We also pulled additional data on marriages of 15-year-olds from the Department of Health website. Those figures show that, during the span, there were: • four 13-year-old brides; • twenty-four 14-year-old brides; • at least 170 brides who were 15 years olds; and • grooms who ranged in aged from 14 to 16. In a follow-up email, Brewster said that preliminary figures for 2015 show the youngest bride was 14 and the youngest groom was 15. You may have noticed that the latest figures don’t show any 12-year-olds getting married during that span. Brewster told us that the earlier information the department sent to the Tahirih Justice Center about 12-year-olds was wrong. The department’s registrar, Janet Rainey, wrote to us that some incorrect birthdays for brides and grooms had been entered into a database. That said, it’s still troubling that 13-, 14- and 15-year-olds are marrying in Virginia. Smoot said, "I think that we can’t know what all the stories are behind those statistics, but I can tell you that when you have someone, an adolescent that young, there is a greater likelihood that the parents are coercing them to get married and it is not of their own free will." She said Virginia is not unique in this regard; her group released a report in October citing instances of children younger than 15 being married in Texas, New Jersey and Maryland. A Department of Health chart shows than since 2010, most marriages of Virginia children younger than 16 have occurred in rural counties in the Southwest and Southside regions of the state. Vogel amended setting the the age limit at 16 with no exceptions has been passed by the Courts of Justice Committee and now is pending before the full Senate. Our ruling Vogel said that in Virginia, "people are going and getting marriage licenses who are 12 and 13, and 14 and 15 years old." There’s no dispute that there are children 13 to 15 who have gotten married. But the 12-year-olds are another story. Vogel relied on Department of Health information to say that 12-year-olds are getting married. That data, the department now says, is incorrect due to a database flaw. Bottom line: There are no records of 12-year-olds getting married from 2004 to 2014. We don’t fault Vogel for that glitch. Still, her statement requires a clarification. So we rate Vogel’s claim Mostly True. Editor's Note: This post has been updated to make clear that circuit court clerks are the ones that issue marriage licenses for minors under 16.

pomt-03727	"In Rhode Island, 28 percent of adults released from state prisons are re-incarcerated within a year."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/apr/15/ban-the-box-ri/video-says-28-percent-adults-released-rhode-island/	Rhode Island lawmakers recently heard testimony on a bill that would prohibit employers from asking job applicants if they have ever been convicted of a crime. The so-called "ban-the-box" legislation would bar employers from asking about a conviction history until "after making a conditional offer of employment" or "determining that an applicant is a finalist." Advocates for the bill, calling themselves Ban the Box RI, posted a six-minute film on YouTube supporting the legislation. It includes people who are identified only by their first names talking about how they had difficulty finding jobs after serving time in prison. State legislators and other officials who sponsored or support the proposal also make appearances. And A.T. Wall, the director of the Rhode Island Department of Corrections, appears and speaks in the film, although he told The Providence Journal after the film was released that he has taken no position on the bill. In the film, Wall describes what prisoners need to succeed when they re-enter society, noting the most important is employment. As he is speaking, a written statement appears on screen: "In Rhode Island, 28 percent of adults released from state prisons are re-incarcerated within a year." We wanted to see if that figure is accurate. Emmett FitzGerald, who helped make the movie, referred us to a Department of Corrections annual report. The department’s 2012 annual population report states that 3,387 offenders were released in calendar year 2009, a release group whose post-release statistics are being compiled over three years. "Within 1 year of release 28% of offenders returned to RIDOC with a new sentence," the report says. PolitiFact Rhode Island also checked directly with the Department of Corrections to verify the number. Susan Lamkins, programming services officer, responded with a January 2013 document that said 31 percent of offenders released in 2009 returned to the state prisons under a new sentence within one year of release. Lamkins explained the difference in an e-mail: "Due to a slight change in methodology these numbers were updated in January to reflect the correct return rate percentage." Whichever percentage one uses, both include parole and probation violators. The figures do not account for offenders who were released and later arrested on a new charge but were still awaiting trial. The Department of Corrections also provided in its report some comparison rates from four other New England states, but they were for different, and longer, periods after initial release from prison. Connecticut, for instance, had a 47-percent rate of offenders returning to prison within two years of release. (In Rhode Island, 42 percent returned to prison within 24 months of initially being released.) Other figures the Department of Corrections report cited were 43 percent for Massachusetts, 44.2 percent for New Hampshire and 52 percent for Vermont, but those were return-to-prison rates within three years of release. Rhode Island did not publish a three-year statistic. Year-three rates for the 2009 release group are slated to be published in the early summer, according to Lamkins. Our ruling The group Ban the Box RI, in its video says that "in Rhode Island, 28 percent of adults released from state prisons are re-incarcerated within a year." That was an accurate citation of a Department of Corrections figure at the time. The figure was revised to 31 percent -- close enough for us to rule True.

pomt-11106	"Ohio's (payday lending) laws are now the worst in the nation. Things have gotten so bad that it is legal to charge 594 percent interest on loans."	true	/ohio/statements/2018/jun/08/richard-cordray/richard-cordray-says-ohio-payday-lending-law-worst/	Though consumer advocates have long called for changing the payday lending law in Ohio, a criminal investigation has resulted in the resignation of the state House speaker. Republican Cliff Rosenberger resigned in April as the FBI was investigating his foreign travel sponsored by payday-lending lobbyists. He denied wrongdoing. Rosenberger’s resignation brought votes on legislation screeching to a halt, including a proposed bill to strengthen consumer protections for payday loans. Consumer advocates are collecting signatures to put similar language before voters on the ballot, likely in 2019. The Ohio Consumer Lenders Association, which represents the industry, opposes the measures. Richard Cordray, the Democrat running for governor against Republican Mike DeWine, has criticized the state law. "The current shutdown of the State House has delayed legislation addressing payday lending, where Ohio's laws are now the worst in the nation," Cordray tweeted May 17. "Things have gotten so bad that it is legal to charge 594 percent interest on loans that end up ruining people’s lives. Unconscionable." Cordray’s statement comparing Ohio’s payday industry to the nation comes from a 2014 report by Pew Charitable Trusts. Cordray worked on changing rules on payday lending on a national level when he was the first director of the federal Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. The bureau finalized rules on payday lending in October 2017, several weeks before he resigned to run for governor. Cordray has attacked his successor, Mick Mulvaney, for attempting to roll back the rules. Ohio’s payday lending law Payday loans are small, short-term loans that borrowers promise to repay out of their next paycheck at a high rate of interest. About three dozen states have their own payday laws, including Ohio. Proponents argue that the working poor need payday loans to cover their bills, while opponents argue that they trap borrowers in a cycle of debt. About one in 10 adults in Ohio have taken out a payday loan. In 2008, Ohio lawmakers approved the Short Term Loan Act. The law, opposed by the industry, included protections for borrowers, such as capping the loan at $500 and the annual interest rates for payday loans at 28 percent. However, payday lenders found a loophole: They registered as mortgage lenders instead. The Ohio Supreme Court upheld the law in 2014, prompting one concurring judge to ask, "Were the lobbyists smarter than the legislators? Did the legislators realize that the bill was smoke and mirrors and would accomplish nothing?" Ohio is the only state where lenders operate under such a statute that was not intended for payday loans, said Alex Horowitz, senior research officer for Pew Charitable Trust's consumer finance project, which has researched payday laws in the states for many years. In a 2014 analysis of states’ payday lending laws, Pew didn’t flat-out label Ohio as the worst in the nation for payday lending. But it did find that borrowers were charged much more than their peers in many other states. By examining payday loan prices in each state from the four largest lenders, Pew found that over five months a $300 payday loan would cost an Ohio borrower $680 in interest and fees, which equals an average annual percentage rate of 591 percent (which is close to the 594 percent figure cited by Cordray.) No other state had a higher rate, according to the Pew analysis. The interest and fees amount in Ohio was slightly exceeded by Texas, but Texas has more protections for consumers, including a 180-day loan limit that Ohio doesn’t have. While the typical loan is technically two weeks, in the majority of cases the borrower ends up in a cycle of loans for several months. While most states that allow payday lending cap loans at $500, Ohio lenders don’t operate under the Short Term Loan Act, so they can make loans that are double or even triple the amount of conventional payday loans. The Center for Responsible Lending, an organization that calls for more safeguards for consumers, found in 2015 that payday loan storefronts in Ohio advertised rates of more than 600 percent annual percentage rate. Diane Standaert, director of state policy, said that since that time some storefronts now reflect rates between 300 and 400 percent for some loans. "But this is basically comparing the differences between (1) a very bad loan, and (2) another very bad loan," she said. The effort to change Ohio’s payday lending law gained steam in March 2017 when House Bill 123 was introduced by State Reps. Kyle Koehler, a Republican of Springfield, and Michael Ashford, a Toledo Democrat. The bill is similar to Colorado’s payday lending law which consumer advocates have upheld as a model example. After languishing for a year, it passed a House committee in April 2018 about a week after Rosenberger resigned, but a full vote was placed on hold while lawmakers deadlocked over picking a new speaker. On June 7, the House passed the bill and it now heads to the Senate. The bill would cap the interest rate at 28 percent and a fee of up to $20 a month, which would mean that a borrower of $300 would pay $96 in interest and fees. Our ruling Cordray said, "Ohio's (payday lending) laws are now the worst in the nation. Things have gotten so bad that it is legal to charge 594 percent interest on loans." Pew Charitable Trusts found in 2014 that over five months a $300 payday loan would cost an Ohio borrower $680 in interest and fees, which equals an average annual percentage rate of 591 percent. While the report didn’t call out Ohio as the "worst in the nation," no other state had a rate that was higher, according to the report. The difference between the 591 percent cited in the report and the 594 percent tweeted by Cordray is negligible. We rate this statement True.

pomt-04378	Says Mitt Romney and George Allen "would overturn Roe v. Wade and allow states to end safe, legal abortion even in cases of rape, incest or when a woman's life is at risk."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/19/planned-parenthood/planned-parenthood-says-mitt-romney-and-george-all/	Abortion rights are at risk state by state with Republicans in charge, according to a new mailing from a super PAC affiliated with Planned Parenthood. The mailer, which targets female voters in Richmond and Northern Virginia, says presidential candidate Mitt Romney and U.S. Senate candidate George Allen would "overturn Roe v. Wade." That would "allow states to end safe, legal abortion even in cases of rape, incest or when a woman's life is at risk," the ad says. Romney and Allen have both gone on record as opposed to abortion except in cases of rape, incest and when necessary to save the mother’s life. But this mailer didn’t claim they opposed abortion in all cases. Instead, it said the end of Roe vs. Wade would allow states to pass such blanket bans. Justices ruled in the 1973 case that a woman has a qualified constitutional right to terminate her pregnancy. Nearly 40 years later, that means states can’t enforce laws that represent an "undue burden" on women seeking an abortion. We wondered, would Romney and Allen overturn Roe vs. Wade? And would that allow states to end abortion? Romney and Allen on ‘Roe’ First we’ve got to state the obvious: neither a president nor a senator can overturn a Supreme Court decision. But a president could appoint a justice interested in revisiting the issues raised in Roe, and a senator could vote to confirm such an nominee. (The New York Times and Atlantic, among others, have written about the 2012 election’s possible effect on the makeup of the court.) If a spot opened on the aging court, does that reflect what Romney and Allen have said they would do? Essentially, yes. Romney’s ever-shifting stances on abortion can be tough to pin down — the same week this mailer emerged, he said there wasn’t any antiabortion legislation on his agenda, then his spokeswoman said that of course he would support such legislation. (And when he ran for office in liberal Massachusetts, he said he supported a "woman's right to choose.") But on the question of Roe vs. Wade, his campaign website is clear. He wants it overturned: "Mitt believes that life begins at conception and wishes that the laws of our nation reflected that view. But while the nation remains so divided, he believes that the right next step is for the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade – a case of blatant judicial activism that took a decision that should be left to the people and placed it in the hands of unelected judges. With Roe overturned, states will be empowered through the democratic process to determine their own abortion laws and not have them dictated by judicial mandate." He also said on Meet the Press on Sept. 9, 2012, that he would "appoint justices for the Supreme Court that will follow the law and the constitution. And it would be my preference that they reverse Roe v. Wade and therefore they return to the people and their elected representatives the decisions with regards to this important issue." Now, Allen. His website says his "commitment to protecting innocent human life is firm" and that he opposes abortion "except in the rare cases where the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest, and when necessary to save the life of the mother." It doesn’t mention Roe vs. Wade. Planned Parenthood pointed us to his 2003 vote against the Harkin Amendment, which asked U.S. senators to affirm that the decision "should not be overturned." Meanwhile, his website argues that "his record on life issues is strong," noting that it earned him a 100 percent rating from the National Right to Life Committee when he was in the Senate, among other accomplishments. Allen’s campaign didn’t respond to our request to confirm whether he’s interested in an overturn of Roe, but the evidence is strong he would vote to confirm an anti-Roe nominee for the court if given the opportunity. A new Supreme Court justice Still, there’s no guarantee Romney would have a chance to replace a justice who supports Roe. Justices Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg are in their 70s, but wouldn’t voluntarily step aside under a Republican president, say court-watchers such as ScotusBlog publisher Tom Goldstein and CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. There’s no guarantee that Allen would be part of a Senate majority that would vote to confirm an anti-Roe justice. The chamber is up for grabs in the election, with more than 50 seats needed for a majority. We can say a win for Allen would put Republicans closer to overtaking the Senate: Virginia, a tossup state, is voting to replace retiring Democrat Jim Webb. There’s also no guarantee a newly reshuffled court would push to fully overturn Roe, returning the issue to states — though there’s no shortage of predictions it would, including from Toobin. But even the current court’s take on Roe vs. Wade hasn’t been well tested. "We don't know enough, because we haven't had much in the way of abortion cases since (Chief Justice John) Roberts and (Samuel) Alito joined the court," said Goldstein, who has argued 25 cases before the court. "... We don't know if the court is currently ready or would be ready with one more vote to overturn it." More likely, perhaps, would be a reinterpretation of "undue burden" that was far more narrow, allowing a wider range of state restrictions on abortion. States after ‘Roe’ But let’s assume, for the sake of argument, Romney gets to nominate an anti-Roe justice, Allen votes along with a majority of fellow senators to confirm that nomination, and a more conservative court picks a case that allows it to completely overturn Roe vs. Wade. Would that "allow states to end safe, legal abortion even in cases of rape, incest or when a woman's life is at risk"? Well, yes, but that’s unlikely to be the most common result. New limits on abortion, however, would be likely. The Center for Reproductive Rights found in 2004 that 30 states "were poised to criminalize abortion soon after a Roe reversal." The Guttmacher Institute, which works to "advance sexual and reproductive health and rights," keeps an updated fact-sheet called, "Abortion Policy in the Absence of Roe." This month, it showed that 20 states already have laws that could be used to restrict the legal status of abortion, from those that automatically ban abortion if Roe were overturned to laws that express intent to restrict the right to legal abortion "to the maximum extent permitted" by the court. But seven states have laws that protect the right to choose abortion "prior to viability or when necessary to protect the life or health of the woman." "A categorical ban, I think, would be quite rare," Goldstein said. Still, an overturned Roe would theoretically "allow" states to ban abortion without exceptions for rape, incest or the life of the mother, as the Planned Parenthood ad claims — whether they actually implemented such laws or not. So, let’s reprise the "ifs": • If Romney and Allen win and • If Romney gets the chance to replace a liberal justice and • If Allen and other senators confirm a justice who supports overturning Roe and • If that new justice creates a majority on the court willing to revisit Roe and • If there’s an appropriate case for the Supreme Court to review and • If the court decides to fully overturn Roe, returning abortion regulations to the states Then a state legislature could vote to "end safe, legal abortion even in cases of rape, incest or when a woman's life is at risk." Our ruling A Planned Parenthood mailer in Virginia claims that "(Mitt) Romney and (George) Allen would overturn Roe v. Wade and allow states to end safe, legal abortion even in cases of rape, incest or when a woman's life is at risk." A president and a senator don’t have the power to directly overturn a Supreme Court decision, but they could nominate and vote for an anti-Roe justice if a spot opened. Meanwhile, there’s no guarantee that a reshuffled court would fully overturn the decision, as opposed to further limiting a woman’s right to choose, but preserving protection in cases of rape, incest or risk to a woman's life. The ad says Romney and Allen "would." We suppose they would if they could — but whether they could is substantially more speculative than the ad suggests. We rate the ad’s claim Half True.

pomt-02009	"Right now, America has $1.1 trillion of student debt. That’s more than credit card debt."	true	/virginia/statements/2014/jun/10/mark-warner/warner-says-us-student-debt-has-surpassed-credit-c/	Sen. Mark Warner’s re-election stump speech dwells on giving everyone an equal opportunity and high on that list is an affordable college education. Warner and many of his fellow Democrats have called for legislation that would ease student debt by allowing students to refinance their federal college loans at substantially lower interest rates and limit their loan repayments to 10 percent of their annual income. President Barack Obama endorsed those measures during a speech Monday.. Warner, during a recent speech of his own, said, "Right now, America has $1.1 trillion of student debt. That’s more than credit card debt." This statistic caught our attention, so we put it to the Truth-O-Meter. David Turner, spokesman for Warner’s campaign, backed up the statement by sending us a speech by an official at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and data from the Federal Reserve System. Both of those sources say that student debt has topped $1 trillion and the speech noted that it had surpassed credit cards. But the best data comes from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which publishes debt statistics every quarter. In the most recent report, covering first three months of 2014, student loan debt totaled $1.1 trillion, while credit card debt hit $659 billion. The largest type of debt for Americans is mortgages, which came in at $8.2 trillion in the first quarter. Student loan debt is No. 2, followed by automobile loans at $875 billion and credit card debt in making up $11.7 trillion in all debt. Student debt began to outpace credit card debt in the second quarter of 2010, when college loans hit $762 billion. Student debt topped the $1 trillion mark in the third quarter of last year. Average tuition across the nation increased 79.5 percent from 2003-2013, according to data from the U.S. Labor Department. For comparison, the Consumer Price Index grew by 26.7 percent during the same span and average wages grew by 30.1 percent. Credit card debt, by contrast, has gradually fallen from $843 billion in early 2009 to its $659 billion level this year. Much of the decrease occurred during the recession when people cut back on spending. But the recession exacerbated college debts, according to Caroline Ratcliffe, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. She cited two reasons: Tuition was rising far faster the income; Demand for college education increased. "You have to remember that during the time of the Great Recession, more people were going back to school because of the job situation, so they were taking on more debt," she said. A study she co-wrote tackled the demographics of people with student loan debt. It found that student loan debt, for those ages 29 to 37, had increased by $10,381 on average from 1989 to 2010, while car loans had increased $302, credit card debt had increased $1,215 and other debt had decreased $2,078. In 2012, 40 percent of Americans in their 20s had student debt, 30 percent in their 30s owed on student loans, 19 percent of Americans in their 40s, 12 percent in their 50s and 4 percent in their 60s. This included students and parents who borrowed to send their children to college. Our ruling Warner said, "Right now, America has $1.1 trillion of student debt. That’s more than credit card debt." His figure on student debt is accurate and total U.S. credit card debt in the first quarter of this year was $659 billion. We rate Warner’s statement True.

pomt-06200	Suzanne Bonamici votes with her party a partisan 98 percent of the time.	half-true	/oregon/statements/2011/dec/09/rob-cornilles/does-suzanne-bonamici-vote-partisan-98-percent-tim/	Both major party candidates in the Jan. 31 election for the 1st Congressional District want voters to think they are independent, bipartisan, above party-line bickering. So it’s no surprise that Republican Rob Cornilles and his supporters like to say that former Democratic state Sen. Suzanne Bonamici "votes 98 percent of the time" with her caucus. He said that the day after winning the special primary election. And he said it again at a recent debate. "She has talked about separating herself from her party but the reality is she votes 98 percent of the time with the Democrats in Salem. I don’t know how that represents bipartisanship; that represents to me more of the same," he said. (And in a follow-up press release.) Allen Alley, chairman of the Oregon Republican Party, repeated the sentiment in a Nov. 15 press release: "Bonamici's narrow world and economic view explains why she's voted in the Oregon legislature with her party 98 percent of the time," he said. Bonamici’s campaign pleaded with PolitiFact Oregon to provide context for the claim. After all, legislators take many votes that are routine, so Democrats and Republicans end up voting the same way more often than you’d think. Game on, we said. Mary Anne Ostrom, Cornilles’ campaign manager, said the 98 percent figure comes from The Oregonian’s "Your Government" website. The O’s web designer and developer Mark Friesen set up the site so readers can see how legislators voted on a bill, and how often they voted with their party. The 2011 Oregon Senate was split 16-14, with Democrats in the majority. The Senate took about 950 floor votes. It’s true that, according to our website, Bonamici voted with her party 98 percent of the time -- but voting with your party 98 percent of the time doesn’t mean you necessarily voted against the other party. We asked Friesen to check Bonamici’s votes against three Republicans in the Senate: Minority Leader Ted Ferrioli of John Day; Jackie Winters of Salem; and Bruce Starr of Hillsboro. Winters is a fierce advocate of social services and Starr is a leader on transportation issues. All three are considered solid Republicans. Bonamici voted the same way as Winters 89.6 percent of the time; with Ferrioli, 76 percent; and with Starr, 73 percent. In other words, she and a Republican voted the same way anywhere from 73 percent to nearly 90 percent of the time. (During the 2010 special session, she voted with Winters 87 percent of the time and in 2009, 77 percent of the the time, for an overall average of 83 percent from 2009-11.) In our view, that makes Bonamici more than a "button-pushing" partisan. We went a step further, just to see how she sides with Democrats on narrower votes. We took a database of 2011 session votes provided by Bonamici’s campaign and winnowed the list down to 106 votes that were lopsided -- 20 votes out of 30 -- or where Bonamici voted no. Here’s what we found: She voted with her party in roughly 91 instances where the issue fell along party lines. For example, she approved a bill to increase driver fees, and she joined other Democrats in voting against legislation favoring online charter schools. Bonamici also voted to change the kicker "refund check" into a kicker "credit" and she voted in favor of expanding Oregon’s Bottle Bill. Those are all positions taken by the majority of her party. In some 15 instances, she was among the no votes, sometimes joining with other Democrats or with Democrats and Republicans. For example, she voted against compromise legislation creating a health exchange. But we don’t see her siding with Republicans against her party. We need to add a crucial bit of information, since Cornilles brings up bipartisanship. Bonamici was chairwoman of the Senate Redistricting Committee and successfully helped negotiate a redistricting agreement with a split House. Lawmakers failed to do that in 2001 or in 1991; redistricting occurs every 10 years. Where does that leave us? Well, we know that the methodology relied on by the Cornilles campaign is incomplete because it ignores votes that are unanimous or near unanimous. Also, Bonamici was one of the legislators charged with creating a bipartisan redistricting map, and by most accounts she did splendidly. So it’s not accurate to say she lacks bipartisanship skills. On the other hand, we find that she usually votes with her party on significant issues. Based on the evidence, we rate the statement Half True because he ignores her bipartisan work and because he fails to acknowledge how often she votes with Republicans. The statement is partially accurate, but missing important details. Go back to OregonLive to comment.	None	Rob Cornilles	None	None	None	2011-12-09T21:00:00	2011-11-27	['None']

pomt-12606	"Apprehension rates at the southern border have plummeted since the 1980s, and apprehensions of Mexicans specifically have reached their lowest point in nearly half a century."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/03/john-conyers/apprehensions/	Democratic congressman John Conyers Jr. urged his colleagues during a recent hearing on immigration to examine measures rooted in fact. One of those facts, he said, is that the southern border is more secure than ever. "Apprehension rates at the southern border have plummeted since the 1980s, and apprehensions of Mexicans specifically have reached their lowest point in nearly half a century," Conyers, a Michigan representative, said March 28. We know that apprehension rates have been down in recent months. President Donald Trump has taken credit for recent declines in southwest border apprehensions. But is Conyers right that rates have plummeted since the 1980s, and that the number of Mexicans apprehended is at the lowest in nearly 50 years? Border patrol data and research from an independent think tank back up Conyers’ claim. Overall apprehension numbers since the 1980s Apprehension data is commonly regarded as a measure of illegal immigration. When apprehensions are up, it’s often thought that more people have been trying to cross the border. However, apprehensions represent events, not individuals. For example, one immigrant may have been apprehended multiple times and all those instances are added to the totals. Border patrol made 408,870 apprehensions at the southwest border in fiscal year 2016, and while that was an increase from 2015, it’s still a fraction of the number of apprehensions routinely observed from the 1980s through 2008, said a December 2016 statement from the Department of Homeland Security. The recession of 2008 is likely to blame for the drop-off that started that year. Conyers' team pointed to that statement and to historical data on apprehensions at the southwest border, specifically years 1986 and 2016. In 1986 there were 1.6 million apprehensions – about 1.2 million more than in 2016. But it’s worth noting that there hasn’t been a steady decline since the 1980s. There have been increases and decreases over the years. During the 1980s, there was an average of 1 million border patrol apprehensions at the southwest border a year. During the Obama administration, the average was below 500,000. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Apprehensions of Mexicans at the southwest border The second part of Conyers’ claim was specifically about Mexican immigrants. He said their apprehension levels have reached their lowest point in nearly half a century, basing his statement on an April 2016 analysis by Pew Research Center. Pew found that in 2015, border patrol conducted 188,122 apprehensions of Mexican nationals, the lowest since 1969, when 159,376 Mexicans were apprehended. "The decline suggests unauthorized immigration flows from Mexico could be falling," Pew research reported. Some reasons for declines in Mexican immigrants during and since the Great Recession according to Pew are: fewer jobs available, particularly in construction; stricter enforcement of immigration laws; and demographic changes in Mexico with decreases in the age of immigrants more likely to migrate. (In 2014, about 25 percent of the population was between 15 and 29 years old. In 1990, that segment was above 29 percent.) DHS also has noted shifts in the demographics of people attempting to cross the border illegally. Over the past 15 years, far fewer Mexicans and single adults are trying to cross illegally, the DHS noted in its December 2016 statement. But more families and children are being stopped at the border as they flee poverty and violence in Central America. In 2014 and 2016, the number of Central Americans apprehended at the southern border outnumbered the number of Mexicans, DHS said. Our ruling Conyers said, "Apprehension rates at the southern border have plummeted since the 1980s, and apprehensions of Mexicans specifically have reached their lowest point in nearly half a century." In recent years, average apprehension numbers have been below 500,000. In the 1980s, they averaged 1 million. A nonpartisan think tank found that the number of apprehensions of Mexicans in fiscal 2015 was the lowest since 1969. It’s worth noting that there have been some ups and downs in the numbers. But overall, the decline has been notable. We rate Conyers’ statement Mostly True.

pomt-07223	"We have seized more currency, more drugs, more outbound arms in the past year than any year in our country’s history."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/jun/03/janet-napolitano/homeland-security-chief-says-more-contraband-being/	As members of the Obama administration push for immigration reform, they’re casting themselves as border security hawks. President Barack Obama said he has "gone above and beyond" what Republicans requested for border patrol. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, a former governor of Arizona, was even more emphatic during a May talk at the Atlanta Press Club. She said "there has never been a larger, more sustained and better effort" on the border than today. "We have seized more currency, more drugs, more outbound arms in the past year than any year in our country’s history," Napolitano said. Has the country’s haul of contraband really reached such historic highs? We asked the Department of Homeland Security for proof. It gave us statistics for seizures by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Immigration Customs Enforcement that compared two-and-a-half years under Obama and the last two-and-a-half years under President George W. Bush. According to the data for the U.S.-Mexico border: * Illegal currency seizures grew by about 75 percent from $124.5 million to $218.7 million. * Illegal drug seizures grew 31 percent, from 3.2 million kilos to 4.2 million kilos. * Illegal weapons seizures grew 64 percent from about 3,100 to 5,200. We asked for more data, but despite more than two weeks of requests, DHS did not give us additional information. So we turned to other sources. In October 2010, the Government Accountability Office, the nonpartisan investigative arm of the U.S. Congress, issued a report on the federal government’s effort to stop cross-border currency smuggling. Data show that cash seizures jumped after the March 2009 start of a program to boost seizures of outbound money and drugs. During the first year of that program, Customs and Border Protection seized about $34 million heading out of the country on land, overwhelmingly from the southwest border. The agency seized $16.8 million in the year leading up to it. The cash seizures, however, varied widely from about $1 million to $8 million per month and likely account for only a fraction of the money that crosses the borders. An estimated $18 billion to $39 billion is smuggled out of the southwest border each year, according to the GAO report. Marijuana drug seizures increased almost 50 percent from 1.6 million pounds in fiscal year 2008 to 2.4 million pounds in fiscal year 2010, according to a separate March 2011 GAO report. We were unable to find similar firearms figures. Further complicating the issue is that as of fiscal year 2011, Customs and Border Protection no longer reports data on its success detecting contraband, according to the March 2011 report. Experts on counternarcotics told us they have no reason to doubt Napolitano’s claim. In recent years, the DHS has doubled the number of border patrol agents, installed technology that makes it easier to detect contraband and paid more attention to coordinating their efforts with Mexico. Improving the border effort, however, did not require an exceptional effort, experts told us. Previously, there was little emphasis on seizing illegal guns, noted Vanda Felbab-Brown, a fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. "Yes, we are capturing more arms than ever because we now try for the first time; the baselines are extremely low," Felbab-Brown wrote PolitiFact Georgia in an email. It’s also important to note that these increases in seizures are not proof DHS’ efforts are successful, said Eric L. Olson, a counternarcotics expert at the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. He said we need to know what percentage of contraband is being captured. If DHS drug seizures climbed 10 percent, but 100 percent more drugs are being smuggled across the border, that’s hardly a success. "They’re doing more things," Olson said of the DHS, "but whether it is accomplishing anything is another question." That’s a question we may be unable to answer, he added. It’s extremely difficult to calculate the total amount of drugs entering the country. To sum up: The data DHS gave us is not enough to prove definitively that Napolitano’s claim that the agency has "seized more currency, more drugs, more outbound arms in the past year than any year in our country’s history." We can say that seizures increased recently under the Obama administration, but they were so low in the past that the bump is not a major accomplishment. Also, the seized contraband is likely such a small percentage of what crosses the border that the increase’s impact on the illegal drug trade is slight. By PolitiFact’s rules, the burden of proof is on the person who makes the claim. Since the Department of Homeland Security did not provide us with enough data to support her talking point, and the increase in seizures is not a clear-cut sign of border security success, we rate her claim Half True.

pomt-03947	Says Austin is the largest city in the U.S. without nonstop flights to Europe.	false	/texas/statements/2013/feb/19/pete-winstead/pete-winstead-says-austin-largest-us-city-without-/	Austin lawyer Pete Winstead is negotiating with European airlines to start nonstop service from Austin, according to a Feb. 6, 2013, news story by KUT News in Austin. The story reported that Winstead said Austin is the largest city in the U.S. without "direct flights" to Europe. Stopping along the way increases chances for delays that could cause a business executive to miss a meeting, Winstead said. "Nonstop air service, even if it leaves Austin 30 minutes late, is not a big problem," he told KUT. Not that PolitiFact Texas is planning any European vacations, but we decided to check the departure boards. Do the United States’ biggest cities all have a nonstop option Austinites don’t? Austin passed San Francisco last year to become the 13th largest U.S. city, according to the most recent Census Bureau news. The Top 12: New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Diego, Dallas, San Jose, Jacksonville and Indianapolis. Austin-Bergstrom International Airport spokesman Jim Halbrook told us by phone that no carriers have a nonstop passenger flight from Austin to Europe. Eight of the nine largest cities have nonstop flights to Europe. Sample itinerary: If you depart Dallas/Fort Worth International on American Airlines at 5 p.m, you can be in Paris nine hours and 40 minutes later. Hop a British Airways plane in San Diego at 10:10 p.m. and you’ll be at London’s Heathrow Airport in 10 hours and 25 minutes. San Antonio ranks seventh by size, and although San Antonio International Airport has nonstop flights to Mexico, spokeswoman Nora Castro told us by phone that it has no nonstops to Europe. Spokespeople for the San Jose, Jacksonville and Indianapolis airports told us by phone that they do not have nonstop flights to Europe. All but Jacksonville have international nonstops -- San Jose to Tokyo, Austin to Cancún, etc. -- but none go to Europe. For a table showing all 13 cities and giving specific destinations, click here. We also checked to see how the claim holds up if we go beyond the city limits and compare the greater Austin area to other metro areas. According to the Census Bureau, in 2011 the Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos area ranked 34th among the country's biggest metropolitan statistical areas, with nearly 1.8 million residents. Both the San Antonio and San Jose regions were larger, so Austin’s not the biggest metro area with no Europe nonstop flight, either. Our ruling Winstead said Austin was the largest U.S. city without a nonstop flight to Europe. But four larger cities lack such flights, making this statement False.

pomt-08531	On protecting Social Security benefits and changing the retirement age.	full flop	/ohio/statements/2010/oct/04/bob-gibbs/gibbs-website-public-statements-vary-social-securi/	On his campaign website, GOP Congressional candidate Bob Gibbs says he’s committed to retaining Social Security benefits for seniors and future retirees. "We need to ensure that benefits are protected and that taxes and the retirement age are not increased," the website says. "We have a responsibility and a commitment to seniors to fund our obligation to them and not place the system in jeopardy by moving away from the current program to privatization of the system." But Gibbs expressed a different view on the Social Security retirement age at a July 12 forum for congressional candidates sponsored by the Eastern Ohio Development Alliance that was videotaped by backers of the congressman he wants to replace, Dover Democrat Zack Space. An audience member asked whether Gibbs agreed with House GOP Leader John Boehner’s stance that the Social Security retirement age should be raised to 70. Instead of citing his website’s position, Gibbs applauded Boehner’s leadership and said the nation needs to seriously discuss how to make entitlement programs actuarially sound. "Our younger folks in their 20s and 30s, they think their retirement age is going to move up, I think they expect that," said Gibbs. "We’re living longer, our life expectancies are going up, and you just can’t have an actuarially sound system if you don’t make these changes or you’re not going to have a system at all." That struck us as a complete reversal of his previous position -- a Full Flop. Then at a Sept. 18 debate in Mount Vernon between Gibbs and Constitution Party candidate Lindsay Sutton, Gibbs suggested forming a bipartisan task force to ensure Social Security’s viability, and went on to say: "I doubt I would have supported it back in the 1930’s when they did it, but we have it now and we’ve got to fulfill our obligations." The remark that he might have opposed creation of Social Security prompted the Space campaign to denounce Gibbs. "Bob Gibbs’ complete hostility toward this crucial program is just plain shameless," Space spokesman Andrew Ricci said in a news release. We asked for Gibbs’ true stance on Social Security in light of his public comments. His spokeswoman, Emily Pettigrew, replied with this email: "You can pull a clip here and a clip there and make it sound like anything, the fact is that Bob Gibbs stands firm that we should not raise the retirement age, we should not cut benefits, and we should not privatize Social Security." Pettigrew said efforts to highlight Gibbs’ remarks were just a "distraction tactic" "straight from Nancy Pelosi’s playbook of desperation." She accused Space of "trying to take the focus off of the double-digit unemployment in the district" under his watch. But Gibbs’ own words provide ample fodder for distraction. His remarks to the Eastern Ohio Developement Alliance clearly contradict his official campaign position that the Social Security retirement age should not be raised. His statement in the Mount Vernon debate suggests he would have opposed creation of Social Security in the first place. Then there’s the statement from his campaign to clarify his position, which clearly contradicts his remarks to the Eastern Ohio Development Alliance. That statement represents a Full Flop on the Full Flop. Ultimately, we end up back where we started. But given the gyrations taken with Gibbs’ public statements on Social Security, followed up by his campaign comment, he has earned high marks as a Flip-O-Meter gymnast. We award him a Full Flop.

pomt-13040	"In 2015 roughly 10,000 political arrests occurred in Cuba. That is five times as many as occurred in 2010, when there were only about 2,000."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/nov/29/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-political-arrests-cuba-have-increase/	The son of a Cuban immigrant, Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said that he hoped President-elect Donald Trump could press for change for Cubans following Fidel Castro’s death. But in a Nov. 27 interview on ABC’s This Week, Cruz expressed some skepticism that anything will be better under Castro’s brother Raúl Castro, who began taking over in 2006. "What the Obama administration has done is strengthen Raúl Castro. Raúl is the dictator now," Cruz said. "You know, I asked my dad at dinner last night, what do you think happens now that Fidel is dead? And he shrugged and said Raúl has been in power for years. The system has gotten stronger. ... You know, in 2015 roughly 10,000 political arrests occurred in Cuba. That is five times as many as occurred in 2010, when there were only about 2,000." We were interested in his statistic, so we contacted Cruz’s office. Spokesman Phil Novack told us the senator slightly misspoke, but his point is still basically accurate. Political arrests in Cuba Novack told PolitiFact Florida that Cruz meant to compare the number of political arrests in Cuba in 2010 to 2016 rather than 2015. Cruz’s primary source was the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation. Based in Havana, the commission is the island’s oldest and most respected non-government, human-rights monitoring group, according to the Miami Herald, a PolitiFact Florida partner. The commission reported 2,074 politically motivated detentions in 2010. That escalated to 8,600 in 2015 and then to 9,125 through October 2016. The commission predicts the number of political arrests "will exceed the level of 10,000 detentions" through the end of 2016. Experts on Cuba say the commission founded by Elizardo Sánchez has the most reliable source of data and sometimes use it in combination with other sources. That said, the data comes with caveats. "It's very hard to work with exact numbers in Cuba," said Pedro Alcántara, spokesman for the Foundation for Human Rights in Cuba, based in Miami. "Not only are we fighting very strong repression, but sometimes the data changes every day." The Cuban regime uses a revolving door for arresting political prisoners — most being held for hours or sometimes a couple of days and often facing violence while detained. In some cases, the prisoners are released without being charged. The commission has been able to report on short arrests, said Florida International University political science professor Eduardo Gamarra. "However, the accuracy of his data is also arguable since there is no 'official' acknowledgment that political prisoners exist in Cuba," he said. "Having said that, it is quite possible that the number of short-term arrests is higher or that it is quite lower." Some pro-regime groups criticize the list of the commission, alleging it contains multiple arrests of the same individuals within the same year. Carlos Ponce, director of Latin America programs at the watchdog group Freedom Press, said he doesn’t know if that is true or not since it is impossible to audit the list. The commission was founded by Elizardo Sánchez, a Cuban human rights campaigner. "But at the same time, the list only covers the cases reported to Elizardo's group, so you can say that there are many cases unreported," he said. There is some dispute about how to define political prisoners, raising questions of overcounting. In 2010, for example, the Associated Press vetted a list of 167 political prisoners by the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation. About 50 people on the list "were convicted of terrorism, hijacking or other violent crimes, and four are former military or intelligence agents convicted of espionage or revealing state secrets," according to the AP. Why arrests have increased While settling on a precise figure of political arrests each year is a daunting task, experts agreed that in general the numbers have risen since 2010. Obama’s announcement in 2014 that the United States would reopen ties with Cuba did not lead to less political repression on the island. Sánchez, the creator of the commission’s list, told Miami Herald columnist Andrés Oppenheimer in July that that the civil and political rights situation had worsened over the past year. "In terms of (Cuba’s) domestic politics, the reestablishment of ties hasn’t had any positive impact," he said. More Cubans feel emboldened to express their discontent with the regime, even as the government sends more dissenters behind bars, said Marselha Gonçalves Margerin, advocacy director for the Americas at Amnesty International, a group that was last allowed into Cuba in 1989. Unless the criminal code is changed, which is unlikely to happen any time soon, the strengthened crackdown will continue, she said. "We are seeing people going out on the streets that didn’t go before," she told PolitiFact Florida. Sebastian A. Arcos, associate director of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University, said there was a shift in the Castro regime from targeted, long-term, politically motivated imprisonment to more frequent and often violent short-term detentions lasting from hours to days. "The obvious goal is to avoid the international condemnation that follows long-term political prisoners, and to prevent dissident public activities to escalate into larger demonstration," Arcos said. "As they say, the revolution cannot afford to lose the streets." Our ruling Cruz said, "In 2015 roughly 10,000 political arrests occurred in Cuba. That is five times as many as occurred in 2010, when there were only about 2,000." Cruz’s point about the rise of political arrests happening amid improved diplomacy with the United States is basically right. He would have been on more precise ground had he referred to 2016 and not 2015, as a spokesman said he intended to do. And while the source of his figures is widely considered to be reliable, experts said it is hard to track and label every arrest for political reasons. Because his point requires additional explanation but is largely accurate, we rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/94293748-11b2-474a-82f0-7754db784836	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2016-11-29T11:53:40	2016-11-27	['Cuba']

pomt-01744	The United States is at "historic record highs" of individuals being apprehended on the border from countries with terrorist ties such as "Pakistan or Afghanistan or Syria."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/03/rick-perry/rick-perry-historic-record-highs-people-terrorists/	Texas Gov. Rick Perry says the border needs more protection against a record-high number of illegal immigrants coming from terrorist havens, but the figures don’t match Perry’s rhetoric. With Congress scrambling to address illegal immigration before the start of their summer recess this past Friday, it’s no surprise that the issue was a main topic on the Aug. 3, 2014, talk shows. Perry, who is considering a 2016 presidential run, appeared on CNN’s State of the Union to talk about President Barack Obama’s response to the crisis in Israel and the situation along the U.S.-Mexico border. Perry defended his recent decision to ramp up state spending on border operations following a massive influx of children from Central American countries. "I'm the governor of the state of Texas. My citizens' safety is what is foremost here. And it hasn't got anything to do with anything other than those numbers of individuals who are coming across the border. And when you think about the idea that some of them are from countries that have substantial terrorist ties, whether it's Pakistan or Afghanistan or Syria, we are at historic record highs with individuals being apprehended from those countries," Perry said. The claim about illegal immigrants coming from countries with terrorist ties caught our attention. PolitiFact Texas checked two similar Perry claims in June. Perry said there was a record number of border apprehensions of people from countries other than Mexico, which PolitiFact Texas found to be True. But Perry also said of the surge in apprehensions, "These are people that are coming from states like Syria that have substantial connections back to terrorist regimes and terrorist operations." PolitiFact Texas found that less than 5 percent of the "other than Mexico" apprehensions in 2012 (the most recent available data) involved people from countries that the United States designates as terrorist states or safe havens. For that, PolitiFact Texas rated Perry’s claim Pants on Fire. Is it possible, though, that the small number of apprehensions of individuals from those countries in 2012 could be a record? By the numbers We asked Perry’s office for evidence, but they did not get back to us. We found the most recent and comprehensive breakdown of apprehensions by country and year in the Department of Homeland Security’s 2012 Yearbook of Immigration Statistics (table 34), released July 2013. The document has data from the past 10 years. Here are the number of apprehensions for Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria: Year Afghanistan Pakistan Syria 2003 61 4,083 369 2004 57 641 106 2005 55 792 113 2006 53 721 151 2007 28 654 101 2008* 74 654 101 2009 74 575 87 2010 88 592 95 2011 106 525 108 2012 95 458 56 *Note: Data from 2008 and on includes Immigration and Customs Enforcement enforcement and removal operations. Based on the DHS data, there were not record apprehensions in 2012 for individuals from the three countries Perry mentioned, nor are apprehensions trending up. In fact, 2012 was the lowest year out of these 10 for Pakistan and Syria. To cover our bases, we also looked the DHS yearbook’s data for about a dozen other countries designated by the State Department to be terrorist safe havens or state sponsors of terrorism. The list includes Afghanistan, Colombia, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen. We found that none of these countries had record highs in 2012. Afghanistan, Libya and Somalia hit their record in 2011, though there is no discernible upward trend. The numbers of apprehensions of individuals from these countries is also incredibly low compared to the primary sources of illegal immigrants. In 2012, DHS apprehended nearly 450,000 Mexicans, 55,000 Guatemalans and 50,000 Hondurans. In contrast, officials apprehended 95 Afghanis, 458 Pakistanis and 56 Syrians. Justification It’s important to note that while Perry was using this statement to justify bringing more resources to the Texas-Mexico border, an apprehension and other enforcement measures can happen at the border, in the country’s interior or at designated places outside of the United States, according to the DHS document. Historically, only an extremely small number of people from the Middle East or South Asia who try to enter the United States illegally do so by crossing a land border, said Stephen Kelly, former deputy chief of mission for the United States in both Mexico and Canada. "People from those areas are more likely to try to enter via an airport, perhaps with false documents," said Kelly, now a public policy professor at Duke University. And many people coming from these countries without a valid visa apply for asylum as soon as they enter the United States, so they are essentially turning themselves in. This has been an argument against increasing the number of border patrol agents in response to the influx of Central American children because they come to the country actively seeking officials rather than trying to evade them. This is because the current law, passed under former President George W. Bush to combat child trafficking, allows children from countries that don’t border the United States to stay in the country. Policymakers are now contemplating changing the law. Our ruling Perry said the United States is at "historic record highs" of individuals being apprehended on the border from countries with terrorist ties such as "Pakistan or Afghanistan or Syria." The most recent data does not show record apprehensions of individuals from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Syria or any other designated terrorist countries, nor does it show an upward trend in apprehensions of individuals from those areas.

pomt-12996	Says "tens of thousands of children" were rushed across the southwest border "because they fear the wall."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2016/dec/15/geraldo-rivera/mostly-false-claim-children-are-rushing-across-bor/	Fox News’ correspondent Geraldo Rivera said a wave of immigrants from Central America is hitting the United States ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. Thousands of children and families have been apprehended at the southwest border in recent years as they try to flee violence and poverty in Central America, particularly in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. More attention should be given to Central America’s economic and safety issues, Rivera said. But he said another concern is also driving immigration to the United States: Trump’s promised border wall. "You have a situation where you have all, tens of thousands of children being rushed across the border. Ironically ... why are they coming now? Why were there 45,000 last month as compared to a year ago?" Rivera asked during a Dec. 12 interview on Fox News’ Hannity. "They're coming because they fear the wall. They fear that the wall will start construction on Jan. 20, and they won’t be able to come and go the way they have been for decades." We were curious about his statement that tens of thousands of children were rushing across the border before Trump takes office and builds a wall. While many children are coming across the border, it’s not at the level Rivera said, and there are other factors motivating them to come to the United States. "I do not think that significant numbers of children are arriving at the border because they fear that the wall will hurt their future chances," said Denise Gilman, who directs the Immigration Clinic at the University of Texas School of Law. "I have personally spoken to many children and mothers who have arrived at the border and almost all are seeking refugee protection, in the form of asylum." Our requests to Rivera for more information about his data went unanswered. November 2016 apprehension data not yet available Border apprehension data is frequently used as a measure of illegal entry into the United States. Rivera mentioned "last month’s" border crossings, which we took as November, but the latest information available goes through October 2016, the first month of fiscal year 2017. Immigration authorities in October caught 46,195 individuals of all nationalities along the southwest border. However, just 6,754 were younger than 18 years old. A total of 5,451 children were from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, according to border patrol data. "Within these totals, we have seen corresponding increases in the numbers of unaccompanied children and individuals in families apprehended," Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said in a November statement. "We’ve also seen increases in the numbers of those who present themselves at ports of entry along the southwest border seeking asylum." Southwest border apprehensions of unaccompanied minors increased 37 percent in October 2016 compared to October 2015. Overall apprehensions increased 41 percent. The main takeaway for our assessment of Rivera’s statement: While overall apprehensions in October 2016 were up from the year before at around 46,000 people, the number of children caught is much smaller. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Reasons for Central American children crossing the border So there has been a year-over-year uptick in apprehensions along the southwest border. Why? An August 2016 Congressional Research Service report noted that gang-related violence, poverty and lack of educational and employment opportunities in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras played a key role in children’s decisions to leave their homes on their own and cross illegally into the United States. We could not find strong evidence to back up Rivera’s assertion that the election influenced their decision to come. Media reports published after the election included comments from the mayor of McAllen, Texas, Jim Darling, who said he believed talks about a wall being built along the border motivated immigrants to come sooner rather than later. "I’m sure that the discussion about a wall and getting tough on immigration was used by people down there to say, ‘Get up here now before it’s too late,’ " Darling, whose city borders Mexico, told the Washington Post. "If you talk to them, they all know about President Trump," Darling told CNN. "They all know about a wall. ... The cartels that are encouraging and making money off this travel, they go down and they exploit that." Darling told CNN he had spoken with recent arrivals. The CNN report, however, also said that Manuel Padilla Jr., chief patrol agent of the Rio Grande Valley Sector, has not noticed an election effect and cited violence and poverty as factors for immigration. Gilman, of the Texas School of Law immigration clinic, also said Central Americans are fleeing extreme violence in their countries. "I have never yet heard a single child or mother mention the wall as a factor in their decision to migrate or in the timing of their arrival," Gilman added. Children and families have not been crossing in great numbers for decades. That has been the case only in recent years, most notably in 2014 and driven by the violence in Central America, Gilman said. Many Central Americans turn themselves to immigration authorities in order to seek asylum protection; to apply, individuals must be physically present in the United States and can do so regardless of how they arrived or of their current immigration status. Immigration officials said that 2014 was the first time Central Americans apprehended on the southern border outnumbered Mexicans. "The demographics of illegal migration on our southern border has changed significantly over the last 15 years – far fewer Mexicans and single adults are attempting to cross the border without authorization, but more families and unaccompanied children are fleeing poverty and violence in Central America," Johnson, the Secretary of Homeland Security, said in an October statement. Back to Rivera’s comment, a month’s worth of data is also not sufficient to infer increases stem from fears about Trump’s administration policies, said Peter Margulies, who teaches immigration law and national security law at Roger Williams University School of Law. Immigration flows are influenced by many reasons, including conditions in immigrants’ native countries, Margulies said. Still, prospective immigrants care about how politics affects U.S. immigration policy, and smugglers "will try to exploit fear of President-elect Trump's immigration plans to encourage people to try to enter the U.S. sooner rather than later," Margulies said. Our ruling Speaking about children crossing the southwest border, Rivera said tens of thousands are coming now "because they fear the wall." About 46,000 people were apprehended at the southwest border in October 2016, the latest data available. But speaking specifically about all unaccompanied children crossing the border, the number is much lower, 6,754. It’s not likely, given the ongoing high levels of violence and poverty in Central American countries, that fears of the election were the primary motivation behind these crossings. The number of Central American unaccompanied children crossing the border increased before the election, peaking in 2014. One month’s worth of data and anecdotal evidence is insufficient to explain that increases stem from fears of a wall, though smugglers might try to exploit that fear to push people toward the United States. Rivera’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d8e970d5-87f5-410f-bda9-ca45dfe97560	None	Geraldo Rivera	None	None	None	2016-12-15T15:54:18	2016-12-12	['None']
pomt-10113	Medicare spends "$15-billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/17/barack-obama/thats-a-fair-estimate/	In the final presidential debate Oct. 15, 2008, moderator Bob Schieffer of CBS News asked each candidate for specifics about programs they would cut in order to balance the federal budget. "We spend $15-billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies," Sen. Barack Obama said. "It doesn’t – under the Medicare plan – it doesn’t help seniors get any better. It’s not improving our health care system. It’s just a giveaway." Obama used the same example when asked a similar question in the first debate. "We right now give $15-billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the Medicare system," Obama said. "Doesn’t work any better through the private insurers. They just skim off $15-billion. That was a giveaway and part of the reason is because lobbyists are able to shape how Medicare works." Obama is talking about the Medicare Advantage (MA) program, which pays private insurance companies a set rate to treat Medicare beneficiaries who sign up. It was conceived as a cost containment measure on the theory that competition between HMOs, PPOs and other private plans would drive down costs. In fact, MA plans have consistently cost the government more per beneficiary than traditional fee-for-service Medicare costs. About 18 percent of beneficiaries now belong to MA plans. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an independent Congressional agency, estimated that in 2008, the MA program cost 13 percent more than traditional Medicare. A Commonwealth Fund report estimates that that translates, on average, to nearly $1,000 more for each person in the MA program, for a national total of more than $8.5-billion last year (and a total $33-billion from 2004 to 2008). Insurance companies argue that people enrolled MA programs get better service. "One of the important things to keep in mind is that Medicare Advantage provides additional benefits and services not available in traditional fee-for-service programs," said Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for America’s Health Insurance Plans. Zirkelbach argues that the plan offers better hearing, vision and dental coverage and a disease management plan. MA plans have also proven useful in some rural areas that are short on health care providers. Some plans refund all, or part, of their clients' Part B Medicare premium, which can save people hundreds of dollars a year. The tradeoff is that beneficiaries are often limited to using hospitals and doctors in the plans' network. While beneficiaries' out-of-pocket costs are often less under MA plans, that is not always the case. Some services, like nursing home rehabilitation, can be more expensive than under traditional Medicare. Brian Biles, a professor in the Department of Health Policy at George Washington University and a former senior vice president of the Commonwealth Fund, said that while MA participants may get about 13 percent more value from extra benefits in the MA plan, it costs about 13 percent more. So it isn't necessarily any more efficient than traditional Medicare, just more costly, Biles argues. "Why should some people get an extra $1,000 in Medicare coverage and some not?" Biles said. In testimony before the House of Representatives on June 28, 2007, CBO director Peter R. Orszag said Medicare is, in effect, subsidizing the added cost of the Medicare Advantage program. But is it better? Orszag wasn’t convinced. "Many Medicare Advantage plans offer disease management, care coordination, and preventive care programs, but little information is available on the degree to which the plans generate better health outcomes than the traditional Medicare program," he said. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that if the government refused to pay MA plans more than traditional Medicare costs, that the taxpayers would save $9.5-billion in 2009, $54-billion over the 2009-2012 period, and $150-billion over 10 years. It was that last projection that Obama apparently used to come up with his $15-billion figure. Joseph Antos, a health policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, believes that if the additional money paid for MA plans is eliminated or severely reduced, "half the plans will drop out in two years." That won’t sit well with people in those plans, he said, and it’s likely to be strongly opposed by congressmen from rural districts – Republicans and Democrats alike – who have a high percentage of constituents in the MA program. Antos also takes issue with Obama’s characterization of the extra money paid for MA as giveaways to insurance companies. "In general, the extra money that goes to these plans ends up benefiting the beneficiaries to some extent," Anton said. The programs tend to have a lower co-payment for prescription drugs and premiums for medical services. "Does some of that stick to their (insurance company) fingers, of course," Antos said. It's Obama's interpretation when he calls the added payments for MA programs insurance company "subsidies" or "giveaways." But Obama is on solid ground when he estimates that the government spends about $15-billion a year extra on the private MA program than on traditional Medicare, particularly as we move forward in coming years. And so we rate his statement True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-10-17T00:00:00	2008-10-15	['None']

pomt-09751	During the Reagan administration, "Millions of people were thrown out of work."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/08/michael-moore/michael-moore-claims-his-movie-capitalism-during-r/	In his latest film, Capitalism: A Love Story , Michael Moore singled out the Ronald Reagan administration for the loss of millions of jobs. During the Reagan administration, he said, American government was run more like a business. The fallout of Reagan's "trickle-down" economic policy, he said, is that major corporations laid off American workers at the same time they were raking in enormous profits. And, he said, "Millions of people were thrown out of work." In backup material for that claim on his Web site , Moore points to a line from a May 28, 1991, article in the Washington Post : "Since 1980, 2 million workers have been cut from the U.S. manufacturing payroll. Millions more have accepted — or been forced to accept — reductions in earnings." A couple of things here. First, this is a 1991 article, and Reagan served as president from January 1981 to January 1989. In other words, the time frame referenced in the article includes a year before Reagan was in office, and 2 1/2 years after he left. The added time on each end makes a big difference. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, manufacturing jobs went from 19.3 million in January 1980 to 18.6 million in January 1981 (when Reagan took office), to 18.1 million January 1989 (when Reagan left office), and then down to 17.1 million by April 1991, the month before the Washington Post article was written. So the article is correct that 2 million workers were cut from the U.S. manufacturing payroll between 1980 and when the article was written in early 1991. However, while manufacturing jobs saw a major decline during a severe recession early in the Reagan years (dipping to a low of 16.7 million in January 1983), manufacturing jobs rebounded significantly during Reagan's latter years. So yes, millions of manufacturing workers lost their jobs early in Reagan's tenure, but if you look at the statistics over the entire eight years of the Reagan administration, the number of manufacturing jobs decreased by just a half million. One other point on manufacturing jobs: If you look at historical tables, the number of manufacturing jobs remained fairly stagnant from the late 1960s to the late 1970s, peaking in 1979 at 19.4 million jobs. Since that time, the number of manufacturing jobs has fairly steadily decreased — it was at 13.4 million jobs in 2008. "We've seen declines in the share of the work force that is manufacturing for decades," said Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute. "It wasn't just in the 1980s. That trend was going on before and since." The other point of context needed here is that Moore never specified manufacturing jobs when he said millions of people were thrown out of work. When you consider all types of employment, the picture is less dour. Again, jobs were lost during the recession early in Reagan's presidency, but overall the employed ranks grew from 100 million in January 1981 to 116.7 million in January 1989. And while the unemployment rate grew to more than 10 percent during the recession, the unemployment rate from the start of the Reagan era to the end was 7.5 percent to 5.4 percent. Lou Cannon, who has written several books about Reagan, called Moore's claim "pure fantasy," belied by the aforementioned statistics. "Reagan obviously, like Obama, came into office in the middle of a big recession," said Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute. But by the late 1980s, "all the indicators were extremely positive." Still, Edwards cautioned not to put too much stock in the political actions Reagan took as president on swinging various economic indicators. "Presidents only have so much effect over the economy or business cycles," he said. We should note that much of the slack in declining manufacturing jobs was more than picked up by a surge in service industry jobs, a trend that Moore highlights in the movie as well. Many would note that these service industry jobs generally pay lower than manufacturing jobs. Nonetheless, employment rates improved during the Reagan years. Factoring in for population growth, employment ratios grew by 2 percentage points over Reagan's eight years. And failing to note that while saying that millions of people were thrown out of work is misleading. We rate this claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-07433	Per-student K-12 state funding for Portland Public Schools has dipped from $6,036 in the 2007-2008 school year to $5,644 in the 2010-2011 school year	half-true	/oregon/statements/2011/apr/23/portland-public-schools/portland-public-schools-paints-picture-declining-s/	Come May 17, Portland voters will decide whether to OK a $548 million bond measure for upgrading city schools and where to increase the district’s operating levy from $1.25 to $1.99 per $1,000 of assessed property value). Naturally, Portland Public Schools is hoping they’ll vote "yes" twice -- and to help make their case, they’ve sent out a comprehensive mailer to some 230,000 residents outlining funding, student performance and a wide range of other facts and figures. As we thumbed through the report, one graph caught our eye: a yellow bar chart that showed "Per-student school funding in Oregon (State School Fund formula)" for the current and past three school years. The graph shows the funding down 6.5 percent this year as compared to the 2007-2008 school year. (Here’s how the pamphlet says the dollars break down: $6,036 in 2007-08; $5,989 in 2008-09; $5,834 in 2009-10; and $5,644 in 2010-11.) That 6.5 percent drop in state funding seemed a little suspicious, especially since we’ve heard for the past couple years that federal stimulus dollars helped keep funding relatively flat. What we really wanted to know was this: Has state school funding per student really dropped from $6,036 in 2007-08 to $5,644 to 2010-11? After phone calls to Portland Public Schools, the Oregon Department of Education and the Legislative Fiscal (Revenue) Office -- and winding up with different figures from each -- our collective head was spinning with numbers. So, we threw out the numbers we’d collected and started from scratch. Scratch being the Oregon Department of Education’s website. The Department of Education makes publica wealth of PDFs that lay out the amount of state funding distributed via the school fund formula -- the pot of money the graph addresses. We collected the most recent calculations for the years in question. We noticed right away that the numbers in the brochure were probably referring to Portland Public Schools funding and not Oregon funding generally. Spokesman Matt Shelby confirmed this. The graph had been mislabeled. That’s not ideal, but, while the mistake was sloppy, it wasn’t a definitive answer to our question. We still wondered if that decline had, indeed, occurred. So we adjusted our search and began calculating state funding for Portland Public over the past few years. We were looking for two numbers: The amount of funding the district received via the state school fund formula and number of students in the district. Both numbers can be a little elusive. On the first figure, the funding numbers the Oregon Department of Education keeps do not include the stimulus funding. On the second, there are actually two ways to count students. There’s the resident number -- the number of actual students being instructed -- and the weighted number -- students with certain needs count as more than one student because their education tends to cost more. There’s a pretty big gulf between the two figures. Take the current school year, for instance. Portland Public Schools is home to about 43,300 students; that’s "students" in the literal, you-could-do-a-head-count sense. Under the weighted number, it’s home to nearly 53,000. We asked Shelby which combination of the figures his district has used in creating the chart. Shelby said the district went with the weighted figure for student population and the state funds minus the stimulus dollars. When we used the same figures, we got slightly different numbers than what Portland Public had published. Try as we might, we could not find the discrepancy. That said, the overall decrease since 2007-08 was about 5 percent. No, that’s not the 6.5 percent from the brochure, but it’s pretty close. Next, we checked to see if anything much changed if we calculated per-student spending based on the actual number of physical students. When readers of the brochure saw the term "per student," that’s probably more along the lines of what they thought the district meant -- not an internal weighting system that suggests the district has 10,000 more students than it really does. That gave us a considerably higher per-student spending figure: $7,699 in 2007-08; $7,415 in 2008-09; $7,440 in 2009-10; and $7,234 in 2010-11. In no year did the district get less than $6,000 per student, as the brochure suggests is now the case. Still, if you do the math, you’ll notice the figure has dropped about 6 percent -- closer to the amount presented in the graph. Then, we added back in the stimulus dollars. That made a world of difference. With the stimulus, state funding actually dropped only 2 percent since 2007-08, from roughly $7,700 to $7,560 per "resident" student. Shelby pushed back on the calculation. "We're not going to give credit to the state for federal stimulus dollars," he said. The graph is "an effort to show our community that state support as gone down over the past few years." He has a point -- state funding, in the strict sense, has gone down. That said, the federal government came in to help backfill a hole that represented a decline in the economy -- not a conscious decision to roll back investment in public education. Had the feds not offered a bailout to Oregon schools, the Legislature would have likely made up at least part of that difference with cuts elsewhere so that schools didn't take that large a hit. Before we made our ruling, we had one lingering thought: What does the overall Portland Public Schools budget look like? Well, according to their website, their total funds budget is actually up: $636 million this year compared to $617 million in 2007-08. That said the budget this year is lower than last year’s $664 million pot. Meanwhile, the cost of education -- everything from supplies to teacher benefits -- keeps climbing year after year. Now, back to the case at hand. Has per-student spending in Portland really dropped from roughly $6,036 in the 2007-2008 school year to $5,644 in the 2010-2011 school year? Sort of. Clearly per-student funding has gone down, while inflation has been going up. Still, it’d probably be most accurate to say it’s dropped from approximately $7,700 to $7,230 -- if we’re talking strictly state dollars. And it’d be even more honest to point out that the state got an assist during bad times in the form of the stimulus, especially given those federal dollars were disbursed via the state school fund formula, which is what the graph claims to show. All things considered, this seems like a statement that is partially accurate but in need of some context. We’ll rate it Half True. Comment on this item.

pomt-04096	"In Minnesota, well over 6,200 election-day registrations from 2008 proved fraudulent."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jan/16/club-growth/wisconsin-fight-over-election-day-voter-registrati/	In the debate over making it easy for people to vote vs. making it hard to commit voter fraud, talk of eliminating Wisconsin’s same-day registration has become the new focal point. Republican lawmakers, expressing concern about fraud, have said they would introduce a bill to end election-day voter registration -- a procedure Democrats defend as a way to maximize voter turnout. Republican Gov. Scott Walker has said he wouldn’t sign such a bill. Nevertheless, the issue has not gone away. The Wisconsin Club for Growth stoked the debate in its newsletter on Dec. 12, 2012. The group alleged that in the November 2008 election in Minnesota, more than 6,200 election-day voter registrations were "fraudulent." Minnesota’s same-day registration, which allow residents to register to vote moments before casting a ballot, is similar to Wisconsin’s. The two states are among eight, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, that allow same-day registration. (Same-day registration is to begin in a ninth, Connecticut, in July 2013.) Claim fleshed out Here’s a closer look at the Club for Growth claim. "In Minnesota, well over 6,200 election-day registrations from 2008 proved fraudulent," the group charged in its newsletter. "Post-election efforts to verify names and addresses revealed one or both to be fictitious in that many cases. "Remember, 2008 was the election that made ‘Saturday Night Live’ clown Al Franken Minnesota’s junior (U.S.) senator, furnishing the crucial 60th vote for the monstrosity of ‘Obamacare.’ Franken’s winning margin? 312 votes." In Wisconsin in 2012, the newsletter continued, "same-day registration chaos prevailed at polling places in the June recall that narrowly deposed Republican state Sen. Van Wanggaard. The November presidential election saw 57,000 polling-place registrations in Milwaukee alone." In Wisconsin, election-day registration began in 1976, according to the state Government Accountability Board, which oversees elections. Like Minnesota, residents can use one of roughly a dozen proof-of-residence documents, ranging from a driver’s license to a residential lease to a recent utility bill to a paycheck. In fall general elections, roughly 10 percent to 15 percent of voters who cast ballots register on election day. Minnesota voting Asked for evidence to back its claim, Club for Growth Wisconsin pointed to an opinion article by Republican state Rep. Mary Kiffmeyer that was published in a Stillwater, Minn., newspaper in October 2012. Kiffmeyer served as Minnesota secretary of state from 1999 through 2006, heading the office that oversees elections there. In the 2008 presidential election, Kiffmeyer declared, "we have more than 6,200 ballots out of 23,000 cast by voters who still cannot be found." But while Kiffmeyer raised concerns about election integrity in her article, she did not state that the 6,200 ballots were fraudulent. That figure was generated nine months earlier, in a January 2012 report by Minnesota Majority. The group describes itself as a state watchdog that promotes "traditional values" such as "limited government, lower taxes, parental rights, free markets, protecting our borders and a strong national defense." The report contends there were 6,224 "unverifiable voters" in the November 2008 election and that Minnesota’s system "provides a window for fraudulent voting by use of false identities and/or addresses." Let’s take a look at how the Club for Growth went beyond the "unverifiable voters" phrase and turned it into "fraud." Minnesota Majority said that when local election officials mailed verification postcards to voters who did same-day registration for the November 2008 election, 6,224 were returned as undeliverable "without a valid explanation," such as the voter changing residences after the election. (The same sort of verification is also done in Wisconsin.) The group also said its volunteers found in "many" cases that addresses listed by same-day registration voters did not exist or were not in residential areas. "While not all returned postal verification cards are the result of fraudulent registrations, the large number of unexplained PVC returns is alarming," Minnesota Majority said in its report, noting the 312-vote Senate win by Franken. "Even if only a fraction of these returned cards were the result of fraudulent registrations, the numbers could be significant enough to affect the outcome of several elections." But Minnesota Majority overstates the number of same-day registrants who couldn’t be verified, according to the Minnesota secretary of state. Patricia Turgeon, spokeswoman for the office, said only 2,873 same-day registrations were flagged because of address problems. Turgeon said most of the 2,873 postcards likely were returned to local election officials because the voters moved sometime between the election and when the verification cards were mailed. She said there were also other reasons postcards couldn't be delivered, including: data-entry errors by local election officials; the voter's handwriting on the registration form was illegible; or voters were living somewhere where they cannot receive mail, such as in a battered women's shelter or on the street. As for actual cases of fraud, another secretary of state official, Beth Fraser, said there were about 140 convictions for election fraud in the November 2008 election. The vast majority of those voters were ineligible because of felony convictions. She said the state was not aware of a single fraud conviction from that election that was due to a voter providing a false name or address. Our rating Arguing for an end to election-day voter registration in Wisconsin, Wisconsin Club for Growth claimed that in the November 2008 election, more than 6,200 election-day voter registrations in Minnesota were "fraudulent." According to the Minnesota secretary of state’s office, the number of verification postcards that were returned is far overstated. What’s more, that alone is not proof of fraud. While it’s possible that some of those voters provided fraudulent information about their names or addresses, there is no evidence of more than 6,200 fraudulent same-day registrations. We rate the statement False.	None	Club for Growth	None	None	None	2013-01-16T09:00:00	2012-12-12	['Minnesota']
pomt-09809	"The claim ... that we plan to set up panels of bureaucrats with the power to kill off senior citizens ... is a lie, plain and simple."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/09/barack-obama/obama-correct-death-panel-charge-lie/	In his address to a joint session of Congress, President Barack Obama brought up the most explosive charge to emerge in the health care debate: the specter of "death panels." "Some of people’s concerns (about the health care legislation) have grown out of bogus claims spread by those whose only agenda is to kill reform at any cost," Obama told lawmakers and a national television audience on Sept. 9, 2009. "The best example is the claim, made not just by radio and cable talk show hosts, but by prominent politicians, that we plan to set up panels of bureaucrats with the power to kill off senior citizens. Now, such a charge would be laughable if it weren’t so cynical and irresponsible. It is a lie, plain and simple." The president was referring to a notion most prominently raised by former Alaska Republican Gov. Sarah Palin in a note posted on her Facebook page on Aug. 7, 2009. "And who will suffer the most when they ration care?" Palin wrote. "The sick, the elderly, and the disabled, of course. The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama's 'death panel' so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their 'level of productivity in society,' whether they are worthy of health care. Such a system is downright evil." We have read all 1,000-plus pages of the Democratic bill and examined versions in various committees. There is no panel in any version of the health care bills in Congress that judges a person's "level of productivity in society" to determine whether someone is "worthy" of health care. When we first assessed Palin's claim on Aug. 7, 2009, we gave it our lowest rating — Pants on Fire. Palin may have jumped to a conclusion about the Obama administration's efforts to promote comparative effectiveness research. Such research has nothing to do with evaluating patients for "worthiness." Rather, comparative effectiveness research finds out which treatments work better than others. The health reform bill being considered in the House of Representatives says that a Comparative Effectiveness Research Center shall "conduct, support, and synthesize research" that looks at "outcomes, effectiveness, and appropriateness of health care services and procedures in order to identify the manner in which diseases, disorders, and other health conditions can most effectively and appropriately be prevented, diagnosed, treated, and managed clinically." The idea here, which Obama and his budget director Peter Orszag have discussed many times, is to make it easier for doctors, health care workers, insurance companies and patients to find out which treatments are the most effective, as determined by clinical studies and other research. The House bill states in the section creating the Comparative Effectiveness Research Center and an oversight commission that "nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the Commission or the Center to mandate coverage, reimbursement, or other policies for any public or private payer." In other words, comparative effectiveness research will tell you whether treatment A is better than treatment B. But the bill as written won't mandate which treatment doctors and patients have to select. Nothing has emerged to suggest to us that the death panels claim is any more true today than it was when Palin first floated it. We still rate it as Pants on Fire today. In our book, that counts as a "lie, plain and simple." So we find Obama's claim True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2009-09-09T21:31:29	2009-09-09	['None']
pomt-05611	Says when Rhode Island Lottery was proposed, "state residents were enticed to vote for it with the promise that the money would be used for education."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/mar/28/harold-metts/ri-state-sen-harold-m-metts-says-voters-were-promi/	On March 6, state Sen. Harold M. Metts introduced a bill that would require any new state gambling revenue be used for education. That would include new revenue from the Twin River and Newport Grand slot parlors if they’re allowed to add casino table games. Metts said he wants any additional gambling revenue to be used solely for supporting elementary and secondary education. That "would be a positive step toward honoring years of promises to fund education with gaming revenue," he was quoted as saying in a General Assembly news release. "Senator Metts said he remembers the birth of the lottery in Rhode Island, when state residents were enticed to vote for it with the promise that the money would be used for education," the release says. Many Rhode Islanders share Metts’ belief that the Rhode Island Lottery was created based on the promise that the revenue would go into the schools. But is that conventional wisdom based on fact? When we asked what he based that statement on, Metts said that when he was campaigning for reelection last year, a senior citizen living at the Charlesgate nursing home grilled him about the lottery, saying that money was supposed to go to education. He said the constituent was "very knowledgeable about politics" and he’d be surprised if the man was incorrect. "The generation ahead of me -- all they talk about is that the money was supposed to go to education," he said. "In their mind, that money was supposed to go to education." So we went back in time to find out. Here’s some history about the lottery from its 2011 financial report. On Nov. 6, 1973, voters approved a constitutional amendment clearing the way for the lottery’s creation the following year. "The original purpose of the Rhode Island Lottery was to make up for the revenue lost from allowing the value of a trade-in automobile toward the sales tax liability on a new automobile," the report states. It says nothing about dedicating money for education. Now let’s go back a little further. On Sept. 25, 1973, The Providence Journal reported that then-Gov. Philip W. Noel "embraced the idea that the constitutional convention should propose outright repeal of the lottery ban." The story noted that a member of the convention’s lottery committee, Roderick A.J. Cavanagh, R-Narragansett, had proposed that net lottery proceeds "be applied exclusively to or in aid or support of education in this state." But two days later, the Journal reported that the convention’s lottery committee had voted 14 to 2 "against recommending that lottery proceeds be earmarked for a specific purpose such as education." In an interview Tuesday, Cavanagh said "early on (funding for education) was a prime mover in a lot of the discussion, but as you can see, it didn’t stay that way. As it turned out, the money went to general treasury." Another 1973 convention delegate, former Sen. Raymond E. Grimes, D-Providence, said officials talked about earmarking lottery revenue for education, "but it was never promised." The proposed constitutional amendment made no mention of mandating that lottery revenue go to education, and voters approved the amendment by a vote of 83,757 to 25,840. "Lottery is a big winner," the Journal front page announced on Nov. 7, 1973. The story quoted Noel’s lawyer as saying the governor was committed to "removing the inequity of the sales tax on auto trade-ins with the proceeds of a lottery," and that if proceeds are sufficient he also intended to examine other sales tax areas. The author of that 1973 story, former Journal political columnist M. Charles Bakst, said, "I do not recall a single official promoting the lottery by saying the money would go for education. In my opinion, this is a first-class myth." Peter J. O' Connell, who retired in 1993 after nearly 20 years as the Rhode Island Lottery’s first executive director, said lottery revenue went into the state’s general fund rather that any specific area in the state budget. O’Connell -- a retired state police major who joked that he "went from chasing bookies to being one of the biggest bookies" -- said that while some of that money ended up going to schools, the lottery revenue was never specifically earmarked for education. That notion might have been based on "rumors" or "wishful thinking," he said. Gerald S. Aubin, the Rhode Island Lottery’s director for the past 16 years, agreed that lottery revenue has always gone into the general fund. He could think of just a couple of rare exceptions when instant ticket revenue went toward specific purposes, such as the arts. Aubin said he often hears people saying that lottery revenue was supposed to be dedicated to education. "I’m often asked that question, or I hear it on the radio or see it in the newspaper. It has almost become factual," he said. "But I can never track down any evidence of that being the truth. Nothing I have ever seen supported that." Patrick T. Conley -- a lawyer and historian who served as secretary for the state’s 1973 constitutional convention and participated in drafting the lottery amendment -- said lotteries thrived in Rhode Island between 1744 and 1843, and the revenue went to a variety of civic purposes, including education. But Rhode Island banned lotteries in 1843, and when that ban lifted with the 1973 constitutional amendment, lottery revenue went into the general fund rather than being earmarked for a specific purpose, he said. "Certainly, a number of delegates in committee and in debate were hopeful that the revenue raised by the lottery would help fund our educational system, but there was never, to my knowledge, a serious amendment to earmark lottery money for education," Conley said. "The lottery was basically a revenue source for the state -- in emulation of New Hampshire, which had no income or sales tax but did have a lottery." Bakst said, "I do have a guess as to why folks think the money was to go to education; I believe that early states to have a modern lottery -- New Hampshire, say -- did specify that the money go to schools. These early lotteries got enormous publicity because lotteries were such a novelty." Indeed, New Hampshire launched the country’s first state lottery in 1964, and all the net revenue was earmarked for public education between kindergarten and 12th grade, New Hampshire Lottery Commission spokeswoman Maura McCann said. "That was the whole reason it passed successfully," she said. To date, the lottery has raised about $1.5 billion for New Hampshire public schools, she said. Our ruling Sen. Harold Metts said he remembered that voters were enticed to vote for the lottery because the proceeds would be used for education. As it turns out, Metts, a retired educator, has inadvertently provided Rhode Island with a teachable moment. He certainly is not the first person to make that claim. But if he had done his homework, he would know that all the evidence shows that no such promise was made. We rate his statement False.

pomt-13647	"I haven't switched my position" on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/07/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-he-hasnt-changed-his-position-trans/	Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine defended Hillary Clinton from public skepticism over her trustworthiness and addressed his own pro-trade baggage Aug. 7 on NBC’s Meet the Press. Clinton has "learned from" her email controversy and will be "real transparent" moving forward, Kaine said. While Clinton’s trust issue lies predominantly with independent and Republican voters, Kaine’s critics are progressives who fault him for his perceived past support of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Host Chuck Todd said Kaine "essentially switched" his position on the trade deal to align with Clinton’s own flip-flop, but Kaine begged to differ: "I haven’t switched my position," he said. "I was a strong supporter a year ago of giving President Obama the ability to negotiate a trade deal. But I said at the time, when that deal was done and on the table, I was going to look at it very carefully. And I even expressed a very serious concern I had with how it was developed, which is that companies were given rights to enforce provisions, but the labor and environmental provisions could not be effectively enforced. That was never fixed. I've asked again and again to understand this piece of the TPP. And I've never gotten a good answer. We can't have a deal that cannot be enforced. And so, for that reason, yeah, I'm going to oppose it in the lame duck if it comes up after Election Day." Has Kaine’s position on the trade deal been consistent? Kaine’s turn on the trade deal was not as dramatic as the presidential nominee’s. But there was still a noticeable shift when he became Clinton’s running mate. Kaine is against the deal now, but he had kinder things to say about it before without taking a firm position. Many point to Kaine’s support for Trade Promotion Authority — which allows the president to negotiate a trade treaty with only an up-or-down vote on the final package in the Senate — as proof of his pro-TPP stance. Kaine was just one of 13 Senate Democrats who voted in June 2015 to give Obama fast-track authority. On the day of the vote, Kaine explained his thinking to The Atlantic. "For my sake, I got assurances I need that made me feel comfortable voting today. But I've got a backstop, which is if those assurances are not met, then I will vote against the treaty when it eventually hits the table," he said. "I'm not going to vote for TPP when there is no program to retrain workers who are affected by trade." That’s roughly what he’s been saying for the past year and a half: He supports giving Obama negotiating authority, but would wait for TPP to be finalized before taking a stance on it. Here are some examples of what he’s said: • May 7, 2015, interview with Politico: "I tell everybody the same thing: I’m pro-trade, but it’s got to be under the right conditions, and I want to make sure that that’s the case." • May 14, 2015, statement to the Hampton Daily Press: Giving Obama fast-track authority "gives the U.S. the best chance of elevating the standards for global trade in ways that will level the playing field," but "as we prepare to take up major trade initiatives in the coming months, my biggest priority is ensuring we can negotiate enforceable deals that protect workers' rights, environmental standards and intellectual property, while eliminating barriers that some countries erect to keep American products out." • May 16, 2015, column in the Richmond Times-Dispatch: "I will support TPA because it gives the U.S. the best chance of elevating the standards for global trade in ways that will level the playing field for our workers, farmers and companies. My support for TPA is not a blind endorsement of any pending trade negotiation. Once we establish our key principles, I will make sure that the specifics of any final deal are placed before the public and fully debated to see if they meet our standards and help Virginia." • June 18, 2015, interview on the John Frederick Show: "I support the president’s ability to try to negotiate trade deals that other presidents have had — that’s the Trade Promotion Authority. And if the president and his team can get a good deal with the 12 Pacific rim nations — this Trans-Pacific Partnership — I will be supportive of a good deal. I won't support a bad deal." • Nov. 5, 2015, statement applauding the public release of the deal: "I look forward to having extensive dialogue with Virginians about the provisions of the deal." So Kaine is right that he never took an official stance on TPP and has always advocated for labor and environmental provisions. But in recent weeks, he’s also praised the deal without saying he would support it. (The Senate voted for fast-track authority in June 2015, but TPP itself has yet to be ratified. Given that Clinton and Donald Trump are both against the deal, supporters are hoping a lame-duck Congress will pass it before 2017.) "I see much in the TPP draft — which has now been public and apparent to everybody for quite a while — that I like," he said to Politico on July 11. "There’s one piece that I’m still really digging into is the dispute resolution." "I am having discussions with a lot of groups around Virginia about the treaty itself. I see much to like. I think it’s an upgrade of labor standards, I think it’s an upgrade of environmental standards. I think it’s an upgrade of intellectual property protections," he told the Intercept on July 21, a day before Clinton announced him as her VP pick. Kaine then formally came out opposing TPP when he officially joined the ticket. When asked how Obama felt about Kaine’s shift on the deal, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said he’d let Kaine speak for himself. Our ruling Kaine said, "I haven’t switched my position" on TPP. Though Kaine voted to give Obama fast-track authority to negotiate trade deals, a piece of legislation that paved the groundwork for TPP, he never took an official position on the deal itself. Throughout 2015, he reiterated he would oppose the deal if it didn’t have strong environmental and labor provisions. But in July 2016, Kaine repeatedly praised TPP for including those exact protections. Days later, as Clinton’s running mate, he came out against the trade deal. We rate Kaine’s claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3cf00c56-b13e-4eb1-b32c-02a6da7aa4a5	None	Tim Kaine	None	None	None	2016-08-07T17:29:26	2016-08-07	['None']
pomt-05502	Says his sons were "targeted" on Facebook "by out-of-state protesters."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/apr/15/scott-walker/wisconsin-recall-target-scott-walker-says-teens-so/	When Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said his two teen sons have been "targeted" on Facebook, the news was quickly picked up by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and national outlets such as Fox News, Politico, Talking Points Memo, the Daily Beast and the Huffington Post. Walker didn't elaborate on his claim in the April 4, 2012 interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network. But in a March 31, 2012 speech to the Waukesha County Republican Party in suburban Milwaukee, he disclosed a few more details: "People ask me all the time: How do you do deal with all the grief? How do you deal with the thousands of people who were bused in in front of your house in Wauwatosa? How do you deal with the hecklers, how do you deal with attacks? The kids had stuff on Facebook targeted after them by out-of-state protesters and other things like that." The first-term Republican governor has repeatedly claimed that out-of-state interests backed public demonstrations against him and are promoting efforts to remove him from office in the June 5, 2012 recall election. And after Walker stripped most Wisconsin public employees of most collective bargaining powers with a March 2011 law that spurred the demonstrations and the recall, Republican politicians as well as Democrats who opposed the law received death threats. In November 2011, authorities investigated but did not file charges against a woman who posted a message about Walker on Facebook saying: "Rather than recall him. can we kill him instead? Just curious." And a Madison radio talk show host in November 2011 criticized Walker’s wife, Tonette, and called her names when she said on Milwaukee radio that she worried for her sons’ safety after protesters demonstrated outside of their home. Facebook claim But Walker saying family members have been targeted on Facebook is a new dimension. Walker campaign spokeswoman Ciara Matthews pointed to a December 2011 article by the MacIver Institute, a conservative think tank and news organization in Madison. The article said that on Nov. 27, 2011, Miles Kristan posted this message (complete with the grammatical errors) on Facebook: "Whats it like having the most hated dad in Wisconsin ??? this kid knows." A picture accompanying the article shows the post, which included a link to Matt Walker's Facebook page; the link included a photo of Matt Walker. According to the article, after posting the item about Matt Walker, Kristan immediately posted another message saying "this kid knows as well," with a link to Alex Walker's Facebook page. Both posts were also shown in a news report on WTMJ-TV (Channel 4) in Milwaukee. So, there is evidence that Walker's sons, both of whom attend a public high school in suburban Milwaukee, were "targeted" at least one time on Facebook. Matthews did not provide other examples. We also contacted Jocelyn Webster, a spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Capitol Police. She told us the department does not comment on security issues. As for Kristan, he is a protester, but he’s not from out of state. Kristan has been identified in news reports as a Wisconsin resident and a native of Racine, south of Milwaukee, who moved to Madison to participate in protests against Walker. He was also identified as a leader of some of the protests. State court records list Kristan with Wisconsin addresses dating back to 2003 and as recently as February 2012. They also show he was convicted of misdemeanor disorderly conduct after pouring a beer on state Rep. Robin Vos, R-Rochester, in a Madison bar in September 2011. Our rating Walker said his sons were "targeted" on Facebook "by out-of-state protesters." A protester posted two critical messages on Facebook, one directed at Matt Walker and one at Alex Walker, but the protester is from Wisconsin. We rate Walker's statement Half True.

pomt-14002	"The president has said the national security threat facing America, the top one, is global warming."	mostly false	/arizona/statements/2016/jun/03/paul-babeu/arizona-sheriff-says-obama-called-global-warming-a/	Paul Babeu, the Republican Sheriff of Pinal County, Ariz., near the U.S.-Mexico border, has repeatedly criticized President Barack Obama’s administration for its lack of border security. Babeu, who’s running for Congress this November against a Republican field that includes David Gowan, Ken Bennett and Wendy Rogers, warned of Mexican drug cartels in his county ahead of Memorial Day weekend on Fox News’ Hannity on May 26. But he also used the interview to make a political jab, questioning Obama’s priorities. "The president has said the national security threat facing America, the top one, is global warming," Babeu said. "It’s not an unsecured border, it’s not the terrorists we should be fighting and defeating." This is not the first time we have heard a statement like this: In June 2015, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker claimed Obama said global warming is the "No. 1 threat to the military and world today." The president has said global warming is a serious threat, but it is not No. 1. We rated it Mostly False. We wondered whether Babeu’s claim holds any weight a year later. Contrary to Babeu’s claim, the president’s top national security threat appears to be terrorism. Out of context In March, after the terrorist attacks in Brussels, Obama said, "I’ve got a lot of things of my plate, but my top priority is to defeat ISIL." When we asked for evidence on climate change being the top priority, Tim Gaffney, a spokesman with the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office, noted that Obama has made this claim during speaking engagements. Obama has said global warming is a serious threat and has linked it to national security. But, looking back at news reports over the last year, Obama has never explicitly said it was the top national security threat. Rather, he has said global warming is a threat to the whole world. In an April 2015 weekly address, he said "there’s no greater threat to our planet than climate change." In May 2015, Obama also said during a U.S. Coast Guard Academy commencement address that climate change "is one of those most severe threats." "So I’m here today to say that climate change constitutes a serious threat to global security, an immediate risk to our national security," Obama said. "And make no mistake, it will impact how our military defends our country." We should also point out that the U.S. military has focused on the potential threat of climate change going back to President George W. Bush’s administration. In a December 2015 interview, Obama defended his remarks on climate change, noting at the same time that while terrorists will be "defeated," climate change is the "kind of crisis that we can’t deal with through the deployment of Marines." Our ruling Babeu said, "The president has said the national security threat facing America, the top one, is global warming." Obama continues to cite climate change as a great threat to the world, but framing the issue as the country’s top national security threat is an exaggeration. Obama has said fighting terrorism is his most urgent priority. The Arizona sheriff ignores important context, so we rate his claim as Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0cb68a01-985c-4db8-96bb-cc03740e77a6	None	Paul Babeu	None	None	None	2016-06-03T20:00:00	2016-05-26	['United_States']
pomt-06978	"From now on, we have to pay the Russians $50 million an astronaut to send Americans to the space station"	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/jul/13/marco-rubio/rubio-says-us-will-pay-russia-50-million-astronaut/	The July 8, 2011, launch of space shuttle Atlantis from Kennedy Space Center in Florida marked the end of NASA's shuttle program after three decades. On CBS the day before the launch, Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio voiced concerns about letting the shuttle program lapse, and made a point about the cost the United States will incur while the program is dormant. "From now on, we are going to have to pay the Russians $50 million an astronaut to send Americans to the space station. And we have no plans to have anything in place to replace the shuttle any time before 2016," Rubio said. "For Washington, it should be ashamed that it took so long to deal with this, and that something's not in place. But it's important for America moving forward, because other countries are, China, India, are investing heavily in their space programs. We cannot afford as Americans to lose space supremacy." We were curious about what sounded like an astronomical cost to hitch a ride into space. $50 million a round-trip ticket? (Can you at least check bags for free?) The root of the claim comes from contract modifications the United States signed with the Russian Federal Space Agency for crew transportation, rescue and related services. The idea of having contracts with Russia isn't new, but these contract modifications were crafted to offset the end of NASA's shuttle program. An April 6, 2010 a NASA press release stated that NASA had signed a modification to a contract with the Russian Federal Space Agency for crew transportation in 2013 and 2014. The additional cost -- $335 million -- would cover training, preparation and landing for six crew members. That math works out to about $55.8 million per astronaut. Then in March 2011, NASA modified the contract with the Russians again to provide six seats a year in 2014 and 2015 for $752 million, or about $62.7 million per astronaut, per trip, said NASA spokeswoman Stephanie Schierholz. The increase reflects inflation in Russia, she said. Rubio used the updated figure of $63 million in an op-ed piece published July 9, 2011 in the Tallahassee Democrat. As we noted, contracts with the Russians started long before the shuttle shutdown. The United States has had a contract with the Russians for spaceflight support and services since 1993. During the 1990s, American astronauts traveled to the Russian space station Mir several times. The first U.S. astronaut to fly to the International Space Station on a Soyuz was Bill Shepherd on Oct. 31, 2000. "The idea is that if we purchase services to the International Space Station -- whether through the Russian Soyuz or when commercial providers come on line -- eventually it frees up money for NASA to invest in developing a transportation system that will take us beyond low-earth orbit," Schierholz said. NASA already has contracts with private companies to provide remotely piloted flights and several are competing for NASA funds to develop flights to carry astronauts, according to Space.com. A note about the costs. While $50 million or $63 million sounds awfully expensive, it is obviously less costly to taxpayers than if the United States continued its space shuttle program. With the shuttle program ending, NASA's space operations budget will shrink from $6.1 billion in fiscal year 2010 to $4.3 billion in fiscal year 2012. The space operations budget is broken into three categories: the space shuttle, International Space Station and Space and Flight support. The space shuttle line item is expected to dwindle during the next few years -- from $664.9 million in fiscal year 2012 to less than $1 million in 2016. NASA will pay for the contract with the Russians out of the line item for the International Space Station -- and that part of the budget is expected to rise from about $2.8 billion in 2012 to $3.2 billion in 2016. (For the record, most of the costs associated with the shuttle program are fixed -- meaning NASA would pay out hundreds of millions of dollars for salaries and for parts whether the shuttle flew 1 time a year or 12. Schierholz said the marginal cost -- the additional cost associated with each individual shuttle launch is around $100 million, primarily for the external tank and two solid rocket boosters.) Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos said the overall cost wasn't Rubio's point. The crux of the comment was to illustrate that the United States now has to rely on Russia to get into space. "The main point is that, whereas once the U.S. led the way in space travel, we’re now beholden to another country – Russia – to get to space and to the space station," he said in an e-mail. Back to Rubio's original comment. He said, "From now on, we have to pay the Russians $50 million an astronaut to send Americans to the space station." In an op-ed piece a few days later he noted that the contract had risen to $63 million -- which is the current figure. That's a lot of money per astronaut -- but there are two caveats worth mentioning. First, NASA has had a contract to pay the Russians to send someone to the International Space Station for more than a decade. And second, the overall space operations part of NASA's budget is dramatically declining so while $50 million or $63 million sounds outrageous -- it's something of a bargain. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2011-07-13T14:44:28	2011-07-07	['United_States', 'Russia']
pomt-03780	"A study by the University of Virginia pulls back the curtain on Medicaid’s tragically bad outcomes, including ‘increased risk of adjusted mortality.’"	half-true	/virginia/statements/2013/apr/01/pete-snyder/pete-snyder-says-university-virginia-study/	Expanding Medicaid in Virginia would imperil the lives of low-income people who have surgery, according to Pete Snyder, a Northern Virginia businessman who is seeking the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor. "As it stands, Medicaid’s immense price includes a very real and tragic human cost: all too often it actually harms the very people it is meant to help," Snyder wrote in a March 6 article for Bearing Drift, a conservative blog. "But don’t take my word for it," he continued. "A study by the University of Virginia pulls back the curtain on Medicaid’s tragically bad outcomes, including ‘increased risk of adjusted mortality,’ or as one report summarizes, ‘surgical patients on Medicaid are 13 percent more likely to die than those with no insurance at all.’" We were struck by the ramifications of Snyder’s claim. Under Obamacare, states are being encouraged to expand Medicaid, the government-run healthcare program for the poor and disabled. In return, Washington is offering to pay all the new costs at first, and 90 percent of the new tab in 2020 and thereafter. Expansion in Virginia, which is strongly opposed by Gov. Bob McDonnell, would open Medicaid to an estimated 400,000 people. Across the nation, about 16 million would become eligible for Medicaid if every state accepted the Obamacare offer. Almost all of these people are now uninsured -- making too little money to afford private health insurance but earning above the poverty levels that qualify for Medicaid. The U.Va. study is being cited by several conservatives -- including former U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas -- as an argument against expansion. They say the study offers evidence that spreading Medicaid will spread bad health care results. Fact-checking Snyder’s statement requires two determinations: 1) Did the U.Va. study actually find that Medicaid recipients face a greater risk of surgery-related death than uninsured people and all other categories of patients and, if so; 2) Was the heightened risk caused by Medicaid? The U.Va. study, published in 2010, considered how surgical patients fared during their hospitalization based on whether they had private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid or were uninsured. The researchers looked at almost 900,000 major operations across the country and adjusted for many population and health care variables, including age, income, region, type of hospital, type of operation and other health factors. "Even after adjusting for all those things, the payer was still a predictor of poorer outcomes," Dr. Gorav Ailawadi, one of the authors of the paper, told us. The patients covered by Medicaid had the highest risk. They were 1.97 times more likely to die in the hospital than those with private insurance. Compared to the privately insured, Medicare recipients were 1.54 times more likely to die in the hospital and uninsured patients were 1.74 times more likely. With adjustments, Medicaid patients also had the longest hospital stays and greatest total costs. So Snyder is correct -- those covered by Medicaid did have an increased risk of mortality during their hospital stays. And he’s right that Medicaid recipients were 13 percent more likely to die in the hospital during or after surgery than uninsured patients. But researchers place little of the blame on Medicaid. They noted that Medicaid recipients are the poorest, sickest and least educated group of patients. They are the least likely group to seek preventive health care. As a result, they are more likely to enter hospitals in dire conditions that require emergency surgery. "Medicaid patients had the highest incidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, depression, liver disease, neurologic disorders and psychoses," the study said. "Furthermore, Medicaid patients had the highest incidence of metastatic cancer." The researchers said that uninsured patients have similar characteristics to Medicaid recipients and that it is "plausible" that both groups may suffer from a "system bias" that limits their access to private hospitals and top physicians. "For many surgical patients, private insurance status often allows for referral to expert surgeons for their disease," the study said. "Alternatively, Medicaid and uninsured patients may have been referred to less skilled and less specialized surgeons." Does the research prove, as Snyder and other conservatives suggest, that it’s safer to be uninsured than on Medicaid? Ailawadi, co-author of the study, said it does not. Not all of the uninsured patients in the study were low-income people who would qualify for Medicaid if it is expanded. Thirty-one percent of them lived in zip codes where the average household income was greater than $45,000. Many of these people may have been uninsured by choice. "The uninsured population in our study included a subgroup that may have had a high income," Ailawadi said. He added, "I don’t think we’re able to say a government-sponsored system is beneficial or not." Our ruling Snyder is opposed to expanding Medicaid. He said, "A study by the University of Virginia pulls back the curtain on Medicaid’s tragically bad outcomes, including ‘increased risk of adjusted mortality.’" He’s partly right. A U.Va. study in 2010 did find that Medicaid recipients were more likely to die in the hospital during or after operations than all other surgery patients, including those who were uninsured. But he runs into trouble when he suggests that Medicaid is the cause of the high death rate. The authors of the report note that those who qualify for Medicaid are a high-risk group to begin with.

pomt-14426	Regarding her State Department email practices, "my predecessors did the same thing."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/09/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-said-my-predecessors-did-same-thin/	Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s decision to exclusively use private email to conduct State Department business was not unprecedented, she said at a Democratic debate in Miami. At the March 9 debate, Univision’s Jorge Ramos asked Clinton where she divined permission for her email setup and whether she had a different set of expectations for herself than she did for her employees. "I’m going to give the same answer I’ve given for many months," Clinton replied. "It wasn’t the best choice. I made a mistake. It was not prohibited. It was not in any way disallowed, and as I’ve said and now has come out, my predecessors did the same thing, and many other people in the government." There’s a couple problems with Clinton’s talking point that her State Department predecessors used email practices similar to hers. First of all, there’s the fact that most of Clinton’s predecessors did not regularly use email. Just four former secretaries of state have held the job during the prominence of electronic communications: Clinton, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright. According to MSNBC, an aide for Albright said she "did not use email while she was in office" from 1997 to 2001. And Rice, head of the State Department from 2005-09, was not a habitual emailer either, according to multiple reports. So that leaves Powell, a regular email user, as Clinton’s only predecessor who serves as a useful comparison. When we reached out to the Clinton campaign, they pointed us to Powell. Like Clinton, Powell used a personal email address. However, there’s a big difference: Clinton hosted her email on a private server located in her home. Powell did not. Many politicians use private addresses, but private servers like the one Clinton used are rarely seen, said John Wonderlich, a policy director at the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan group focused on government transparency, for a prior PolitiFact story. And there’s a big difference between a private account, which is generally free and simple to start, and a private server, which requires a more elaborate setup. The Atlantic speculated the Clintons "may have wanted to be in control of the encryption of their correspondence, ensuring that no third parties — whether commercial, hacker, or government — were able to snoop on them." The unorthodox approach has opened up questions about her system’s level of security. If the server was managed without the help of a third party, "you would have to have a staff that’s keeping up with all the latest fixes," said Clifford Neuman, director of the University of Southern California’s Center for Computer System Security. We should note that the State Department has flagged a handful of emails containing information now deemed classified that were received by Powell and aides to Rice at private email addresses. In the more than 50,000 pages of Clinton emails the State Department has reviewed, just over 100 sent by Clinton have been deemed classified, according to a Washington Post analysis. It’s unclear whether the information was classified at the time the emails were sent. Our ruling Clinton said, regarding her State Department email practices, "my predecessors did the same thing." This is a misleading claim chiefly because only one prior secretary of state regularly used email, Colin Powell. Powell did use a personal email address for government business, however he did not use a private server kept at his home, as Clinton did. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-11544	Says Donald Trump is "canceling funding for Obama’s free house and library."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/feb/12/patriot-report/no-trump-didnt-cancel-funding-obama-presidential-l/	A viral story on Facebook says that President Donald Trump decided not to pay for Barack Obama’s presidential library, but no such thing happened. Trump is "cancelling funding for Obama’s free house and library," the Jan. 17 headline on the Patriot Report said. The story provides no evidence and contradicts actual information about how the Obama library will be funded. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The Patriot Report said that after Trump learned that Obama ordered the U.S. Education Department to divert more than $8 million to build the library, Trump rescinded the money and diverted it to privately held charter schools. Michelle Obama was going to get a private residence on the top floor, but Trump supposedly cancelled that, too. "Obama will have no recourse but to try to raise the money or pay for the project himself, but without the big donors and connections of a great Republican president, he’ll probably be stuck buying something that looks like a Bush’s guest home," the story said. In the past, presidential libraries have been constructed with private or non-federal funds donated to nonprofit organizations. Some libraries have also received construction and development funding from state and/or local governments. The library is then transferred to the federal government and operated and maintained by the National Archives and Records Administration, a federal agency, through its congressionally appropriated operating budget. Some staff and programs at the libraries are paid for with funds from associated private foundations organized to fund the construction of the library. In May 2017, the Obama Foundation and the records agency announced that the arrangement for Obama’s library would be different from existing presidential libraries. The Obama Presidential Center in Chicago won’t be in the library network operated by NARA. The center will be privately operated and built by the Obama Foundation, which will raise money for the center. Rather than build a presidential library to hold paper records, the Obama Foundation is providing NARA with digital records. NARA will store and preserve the original materials in an existing NARA facility. University of Louisville Professor Benjamin Hufbauer, an expert on presidential libraries, said the Obama library gains a couple of benefits by opting out of the typical presidential library system. First, the library won’t have to raise the congressionally-mandated 60 percent of the cost of construction endowment for future maintenance. Also, the library won’t have to build an archival facility for documents, films, video, electronic records. Similar ridiculous stories about the cancellation of funding for Obama’s library have circulated on other websites for months. Factcheck.org found the same story on the Last Line of Defense in December 2016. While that website had a disclaimer that said "we present fiction as fact and our sources don’t actually exist," the Patriot Report had no such disclaimer. We found no evidence that Trump had rescinded any such funding for the library. In reality, the Obama Foundation will raise money for the center in Chicago. We rate this headline Pants on Fire.

pomt-00016	"The number of people who just got their voting rights restored in Florida is greater than the populations of Wyoming, Vermont, Alaska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Delaware, Rhode Island, Montana, Maine and New Hampshire."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2018/nov/08/steve-galloway/more-felons-regained-right-vote-florida-population/	Florida has had one of the toughest processes in the nation for felons to regain their voting rights, but that changed on election night when voters approved amending the state constitution to restore the right to vote to many felons. How many? News articles put the figure at above 1 million. One observer -- an NYU business professor -- compared it to the population of several states: "The number of people who just got their voting rights restored in Florida is greater than the populations of Wyoming, Vermont, Alaska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Delaware, Rhode Island, Montana, Maine and New Hampshire," tweeted Professor Scott Galloway who told PolitiFact that he wasn’t involved in Amendment 4 in Florida. Galloway was talking about the states individually and not combined. We found that it was difficult to pinpoint the number of felons who are now eligible to vote but estimates put it above the residential population of many smaller states. Adding up the eligible felons Amendment 4, approved by about 64 percent of voters, amends the state Constitution to restore voting rights of Floridians with felony convictions after they complete the terms of their sentence including parole or probation. It does not apply to those convicted of murder or sexual offenses. Florida has previously had one of the toughest processes in the nation for felons to regain their voting rights, which involved waiting for years and then appearing before the governor and state Cabinet. The Palm Beach Post found that the current Cabinet, made up entirely of Republicans, restored the voting rights of twice as many whites as blacks. Two leaders of organizations that advocated for Amendment 4 -- Marc Mauer at The Sentencing Project and Howard Simon at the ACLU of Florida -- wrote a memo in February that estimates how many felons could regain the right to vote. Their conclusion: as many as 1.4 million. Here’s how they arrived at the figure: They started with the total Florida disenfranchised population, which they estimated was about 1.7 million. Then they subtracted felons who are not eligible including those convicted of murder or felony sex crimes, those in prison or in jail, under probation or supervision or who have not paid fees, fines or victim restitution. That ultimately leaves a group of about 1.4 million. However, there are some factors that could bring that number lower including many of those felons have not paid restitution, fines or fees. In Florida, a 2007 analysis by the Department of Corrections found that of 80,000 people awaiting rights restoration nearly 40 percent had not completed restitution payments, the ACLU and the Sentencing Project found. Failure to pay restitution would make them ineligible to vote. And if we apply the 40 percent level of non-payment, that could reduce the eligible population from 1.4 million to about 840,000. Many news outlets have cited the 1.4 million figure. We asked some state officials questions about the figure and did not receive back any replies that disputed it. The day after the amendment passed, the state Division of Elections had not released any details about how the amendment will be implemented, other than to stay it takes effect in January. (Many state and county election officials were focused on expected recounts following the election.) Census populations Galloway’s tweet said that the number of felons who can regain the right to vote is larger than the population of of 10 states that ranged from about 579,000 (Wyoming) to 1.3 million (Maine and New Hampshire.) If we use the estimate of 1.4 million Florida felons are now eligible to vote, then Galloway’s tweet is correct. If we assume that the number of eligible felons is lower due to non payment of fines -- around 840,000 -- then six states on this list have a higher population. State Census population estimate July 1, 2017 Wyoming 579,315 Vermont 623,657 Alaska 739,795 North Dakota 755,393 South Dakota 869,666 Delaware 961,939 Rhode Island 1,059,639 Montana 1,050,493 Maine 1,335,907 New Hampshire 1,342,795 Our ruling Galloway tweeted that "the number of people who just got their voting rights restored in Florida is greater than the populations of Wyoming, Vermont, Alaska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Delaware, Rhode Island, Montana, Maine and New Hampshire." The populations of the states Galloway cited range from about 579,000 to 1.3 million million. The number of felons who are now eligible to register to vote is as many as 1.4 million, according to the ACLU and the Sentencing Project. However nonpayment of fines could bring that number down to 840,000. In that scenario, six of the 10 states on Galloway’s list have a higher population. Galloway’s tweet generally seems on point though it could be that the ultimate number of eligible felons is a lower number than some of the states’ populations he cited.

pomt-01751	Since 1999, 440 people have been killed in attacks on church property in the United States.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2014/aug/01/georgiacarryorg-georgiacarryorg/gun-groups-church-violence-stats-cant-be-verified/	It’s been a month since House Bill 60 became law and cleared the way for Georgians to carry concealed weapons in several new venues – all bars, many government buildings and, generating the most news coverage, churches that allow it. Jerry Henry, executive director of GeorgiaCarry.org --- a pro-gun group that advocates for fewer gun restrictions --- repeated a strikingly high and somewhat specific number in defending allowing guns in sanctuaries. More than 440 people have been killed in attacks on church property since 1999, he told Georgia Public Broadcasting this spring. A reader questioned that figure shortly after the bill became law on July 1. We decided it was a worthy target for the AJC Truth-O-Meter. Already, PolitiFact found flaws in a specific count from the other side of the gun debate. Everytown for Gun Safety claimed there were 74 school shootings in the United States since Sandy Hook, a tally that included incidents such as a teacher who committed suicide in a school parking lot overnight. We rated that claim Mostly False. Henry told PolitiFact Georgia that he relied on two specific websites, Cops and Cross and Carl Chinn's church security site, for the statistic. He used the term church generically, to cover all houses of worship. Cops and Cross is run by Jimmy Meeks, a former police officer who teaches church safety across the country. A recent banner on the site listed more than 470 "violent deaths on church and faith-based property since 1999," but does not include sources for those figures. Instead, it directs users to the site run by Carl Chinn, a former building engineer for Focus on the Family. Chinn was among responders when a gunman took four people hostage at the conservative Christian group’s headquarters, and later surrendered, in 1996. Chinn said in an email that he relies on news reports, official records and blog items for his figures. Many incidents have multiple sources. That count, though, includes broad incidents not likely to be considered attacks. For instance, the first page of incidents for 2014 show at least two suicides on church property that, according to news reports, are not connected to the house of worship. GeorgiaCarry.org’s claim could also not be backed up with unimpeachable data elsewhere. The Centers for Disease Control found that the majority of the 166 deaths that occurred at houses of worship between 2003 and 2011 were suicides. But the National Violent Death Reporting System covers only 17 states, including Georgia. The CDC cannot provide specific numbers on suicides from the total figure, a spokeswoman said, because that sample is too small. That means the figures are not nationally representative and cannot be used to create an estimate to verify or refute Chinn’s numbers. There is similar incomplete coverage from the National Incident-Based Reporting System, with only about 38 percent of Uniform Crime Reporting agencies providing information, according to the FBI. Without more data, the FBI cannot verify the statistic. The federal government has generally stopped funding such research over political battles between gun control advocates and gun rights advocates. Several prominent social scientists have asked that barriers to firearms research be lifted, and President Obama has signed an executive order for the CDC to research causes and prevention of gun violence. Without reliable statistics, Chinn’s data could be the best approximation of data available. And although advocates often speak with more certainty than data supports, David Kopel, the research director at the Libertarian-leaning Independence Institute, said there is value in stories behind some of the numbers. Anecdotally, backers of Georgia’s law need only to point to Matthew Murray, who killed two missionaries in a Colorado church’s mission training center in 2007, Kopel said. Murray continued his spree by killing two more people at the New Life Church in Colorado Springs. A congregant volunteering to help with security shot Murray, who then took his own life. There have been incidents closer to home. In July 2012, two people were killed in a shootout with each other outside a funeral at Victory for the World Church near Stone Mountain. In October of that year, Floyd Palmer gunned down Greg McDowell as he led a prayer at World Changers Church International in College Park. Palmer also was charged in 2001 with shooting a man outside a Maryland mosque. "Are there incidents where someone comes into church with a gun, with the intent to commit suicide? I’m sure," said Clayton Cramer, an adjunct history professor at the College of Western Idaho who specializes in firearm history. "How often? We don’t know." "Until such time that we have some real, hard data," Cramer added, "the best thing to say is, there are examples where a churchgoer having a gun during a confrontation mattered or would have mattered," And that is where the claim of specific counts falls short. The data has some value in capturing the number of attacks on or at religious institutions. But there is no way to remove suicides from the death counts to ensure a more strict definition of attacks as understood by the general public. Without that ability, even a claim with some truth gives the wrong impression. We rate it Mostly False.	None	GeorgiaCarry.org	None	None	None	2014-08-01T00:00:00	2014-04-09	['United_States']

pomt-03702	"The NRA used to support expanded background checks."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/18/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-nra-used-support-expanded-backgr/	After the Senate failed to advance an amendment that would expand federal requirements for background checks on gun purchasers, President Barack Obama took to the White House’s Rose Garden to denounce the vote, calling it "a pretty shameful day for Washington." Flanked by relatives of some of the slain children from Newtown, Conn., and assassination survivor Gabby Giffords, Obama emphasized how broadly Americans support expanded background checks for gun purchases. At one point, Obama invoked his gun-policy adversary, the National Rifle Association. "Even the NRA used to support expanded background checks," he said. "The current leader of the NRA" -- referring to Wayne LaPierre -- "used to support these background checks." This echoed a similar claim we checked earlier this year. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said on NBC’s Meet the Press that "if you go back to 1999, Wayne LaPierre testified on behalf of the NRA that background checks were appropriate and should be done." We’ll recap what we found when checking the comment Bloomberg made. On May 27, 1999, LaPierre testified before the House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime. The Columbine High School shooting, in which 12 high school students and one teacher were murdered, had happened a month earlier. To rebut what he saw as a demonization of the NRA and its members, LaPierre listed a number of actions and laws he said were good policy. First on that list was this: "We think it's reasonable to provide mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show. No loopholes anywhere for anyone," he said. "That means closing the Hinckley loophole so the records of those adjudicated mentally ill are in the system. This isn't new, or a change of position, or a concession. I've been on record on this point consistently, from our national meeting in Denver, to paid national ads and position papers, to news interviews and press appearances." He also spoke in favor of preventing juvenile felons from ever owning guns, setting up instant background checks at gun shows, and keeping schools gun-free. There’s additional evidence, too. New York magazine, in a January 2013 story, dug up the advertising campaign LaPierre mentioned in his testimony. Titled "Be reasonable," the NRA ads that ran in national newspapers said, "We think it's reasonable to provide for instant checks at gun shows just like at gun stores and pawn shops. But what's unreasonable is how the proposed Lautenberg legislation ignores the 250,000 prohibited people, like felons, who've walked away from gun stores — instead of being prosecuted for a federal felony for trying to buy a gun." We contacted the NRA for our previous story but did not receive a response. In January, NRA board member Sandy Froman told CNN, "The NRA has changed its position, and the reason it's changed its position is because the system doesn't work." LaPierre himself acknowledged this change in a January 2013 Senate hearing in the wake of the Newtown, Conn., elementary school shooting. "I do not believe the way the law is working now, unfortunately, that it does any good to extend the law to private sales between hobbyists and collectors. … The fact is, the law right now is a failure the way it's working," he said. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., then said, "I understand, back in 1999, you said no loopholes anywhere for anyone. But now you do not support background checks for all buyers of firearms?" LaPierre responded: "I think the National Instant Check System, the way it's working now, is a failure. Because this administration is not prosecuting the people that they catch. Twenty-three states are not even putting the mental records of those adjudicated mentally incompetent into the system. Now, assume that if you don't prosecute, and they try to buy a gun, even if you catch them, and you let them walk away, to assume they're not going to get a gun -- they're criminals, they're homicidal maniacs, and they're mentally ill. I mean, we all know that homicidal maniacs, criminals and the insane ... don't abide by the law." The NRA’s website on March 12, 2013, posted its firm stance against expanding background checks. Our ruling In his Rose Garden comments, Obama said "the NRA used to support expanded background checks." He’s correct: In congressional testimony following the Columbine High School shooting, LaPierre called it "reasonable" to conduct a background check "for every sale at every gun show. No loopholes anywhere for anyone." Subsequent statements by NRA officials acknowledge that the group’s position has since changed to opposition to more background checks. So we rate Obama’s statement True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2013-04-18T15:37:46	2013-04-17	['None']

pomt-12436	"Fox star Tucker Carlson in critical condition (then died) after head on collision driving home."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/may/15/blog-posting/liberal-troll-behind-tucker-carlson-death-hoax-spr/	Fox News host Tucker Carlson was the latest conservative media icon targeted by a death hoax after Internet stories surfaced that said he had been killed in a car crash that was no accident. "Fox star Tucker Carlson in critical condition after head on collision driving home," read the headline on a May 13, 2017, post on DailyUsaUpdate.com, a known fake news site. Other suspect sites also ran the story. Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to cut down on bogus news in users’ feeds. The fake story said that Carlson was driving home from Tucker Carlson Tonight in New York when he "was rammed in what looked like an act of violence and not an accident." The post claimed Carlson was taken to a hospital for surgery, while the driver of a Ford Explorer with a reinforced bumper and extra foam padding on the steering wheel fled the scene after hitting the news anchor. That article was followed the next day by another on DailyUsaUpdate.com that said Carlson had died from his injuries, and that police had ruled the death a homicide. The story strongly suggested the crash was deliberate, and had something to do with either the Clinton Foundation, former FBI director James Comey’s firing, or both. This follow-up, too, ended up on other websites. First of all, we know the story is fake, because Carlson is alive. A Fox News Channel spokeswoman confirmed to us that the articles are a hoax. She also noted that Carlson is based in Washington, not New York. The post is yet another fake news story created by the parody purveyor TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a website that has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked. TheLastLineOfDefense.org publishes bogus posts keyed to topics designed to troll conservatives. The site’s creator, a man who said his name is Zeke Wilekenmeyer, has told PolitiFact he deliberately worked to get gullible readers to share his stories to prove those readers don’t rely on facts. The articles quite often end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without an indication that they are fake. The original fake post that Carlson had been in a crash appeared on the site on May 13, and its follow-up was published May 14. Then TheLastLineOfDefense.org published another story on May 14 that said the death rumors were actually a hoax perpetrated by someone who goes by the name Busta Troll. He had been paid more than $100,000 by billionaire George Soros to make up the story, the post said. While the update is written to make it sound as if TheLastLineOfDefense.org had been fooled into thinking Carlson had died because of Busta Troll, the real story is that Wilekenmeyer (or whatever his true name may be) actually is Busta Troll. The troll character is part of a years-long saga involving the author "goating" conservative web pages and using pseudonyms to spread contrived stories aimed at fooling conservative readers. A complex scheme to expose the identity of Busta Troll in 2014 turned out to be yet another trolling scenario. TheLastLineOfDefense.org had followed a similar strategy in April 2017 when saying that conservative rocker Ted Nugent had first been killed in a hunting accident, then had been assassinated, then had actually faked his own death. Nugent was still alive, and so is Carlson. We rate this statement Pants On Fire! See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2017-05-15T16:27:05	2017-05-13	['None']
pomt-14277	Says Rick Scott "stripped women of access to public health care."	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/apr/06/rick-scotts-starbucks-heckler/did-gov-rick-scott-really-cut-access-womens-health/	When Gov. Rick Scott walked into a Starbucks in downtown Gainesville, he got an earful from a woman who attacked his positions on health care. A video of the woman yelling at Scott for about a minute drew more than 259,000 hits on YouTube in about 24 hours and was shown on national television the next day. "You cut Medicaid so I couldn’t get Obamacare," yelled the woman, Cara Jennings, a former Lake Worth city commissioner who is now a stay-at-home mother. "You are an a------! You don’t care about working people. ... You should be ashamed to show your face around here." Scott countered by saying, "We’ve got a million jobs." "A million jobs? Great. Who here has a great job or is looking forward to finishing school? Do you really feel like you have a job coming up?" Jennings said. "You stripped women of access to public health care. Shame on you, Rick Scott! We depend on those services." In this fact-check we will explain whether Scott "stripped women of access to public health care." Jennings is referencing a law Scott signed in March that pertains to clinics that provide abortions. (Here is our fact-check about her comments on Medicaid, an issue on which we gave Scott a Full Flop for changing his position on Medicaid expansion in 2015. We also checked Scott's claim about 1 million jobs.) Scott’s action related to public health care The Palm Beach Post in 2010 described Jennings, then a city commissioner, as an advocate for the poor, illegal immigrants and homeless. We could not reach Jennings for comment. She told the Palm Beach Post and ABC Action News in Tampa that she had been reading about Scott signing a bill that cuts money for Planned Parenthood. Here's what Jennings had to say on Facebook: "I am upset about the awful bill Governor Scott signed last week - cuts funding to Planned Parenthood and restricts abortion access. Just last night I looked online to see if there is a march planned to defend our rights to abortion. And then today, the Governor walked into the coffee shop I was at.....and left with no coffee. (video credit to the stranger who recorded the scene)." On March 25, Scott signed a bill that removes state funding from any clinic that does abortions. HB 1411 passed the House 76-40 and the Senate 25-15, and it takes effect July 1. A key provision in the law is that it prohibits public funding for an organization that owns, operates or is affiliated with a licensed abortion clinic. The law includes several requirements for abortion clinics, including annual licensure inspections, and prohibits selling or transferring fetal remains. In 2014, there were 72,073 abortions performed in Florida. Federal funding is already banned for abortions due to the federal Hyde Amendment, which includes limited exceptions. Florida’s Medicaid program will cover an abortion if needed to save the life of the mother or if she got pregnant as a result of rape or incest. Those exceptions continue under the new law. Planned Parenthood serves about 5,500 Florida patients through Title X, a family-planning program that it provides through a state contract, and about another 2,000 more people through Medicaid in Florida. The state Department of Health spent about $139,000 for the Title X services provided by Planned Parenthood in 2014-15 and expected to spend about $163,000 in 2015-16. The Florida Medicaid program paid about $106,000 in claims to Planned Parenthood in 2014-15, according to staff analysis of the bill. Planned Parenthood offers many types of services beyond abortion, including birth control, STD testing and cervical cancer screening. These are the types of services that state dollars supported. So how much will Planned Parenthood lose in annual funding? We heard figures ranging from $114,000 from Scott’s office to $500,000 from Planned Parenthood. Scott’s office argued that the funding cut is small compared to the overall state dollars given to clinics. "Over $5 million in state funds are provided for non-abortion services at many charitable clinics and county health departments," according to a March 30 statement by Scott. "HB 1411 makes sure no state funds can indirectly fund abortions by supporting the same institutions that perform them. For Planned Parenthood, this would only affect about $114,000 in funds they get annually." Family planning services remain funded at various clinics and centers that don’t provide abortions, including all 67 county health departments. So Jennings exaggerated when she said that Scott "stripped women of access to public health care" because access to certain types of health care remain available. The Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates issued its own statement that Scott was low-balling the amount of money clinics could lose. Laura Goodhue, executive director of the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates, told PolitiFact Florida that she expects the total loss of money to be closer to $500,000. In a news release, Planned Parenthood said Scott was downplaying the effects "of patients losing access to care by only sharing the state funds that would be prohibited under this legislation. However, because the legislation is broadly written, Planned Parenthood will also lose access to reimbursements from local government entities and federal funding from the Title X program that is contracted through local county Health Departments." Planned Parenthood arrived at a potential figure of losing $500,000 based on $50,000 for Medicaid, $147,000 for Title X, and then funding for specific services or counties -- the largest chunk in Palm Beach. The two Planned Parenthood affiliates each had a budget of about $11 million last year. Planned Parenthood is determining whether it can find alternate sources of funding, so it couldn’t yet say how many fewer patients may be served. Also, 70 percent of Planned Parenthood centers are located in medically underserved areas, which means that sometimes they are "the only place where people can receive publicly funded family planning services," according to Planned Parenthood. Critics of Florida’s new law say similar provisions in Texas led about 20 clinics to shut down. Critics of the Texas law argued that it was unconstitutional before the U.S. Supreme Court in March. A spokesman for the ACLU of Florida said that it is analyzing the impact of the law but it hasn’t announced any decision about whether it will challenge it in court. Supporters of the bill, such as John Stemberger of the Florida Family Policy Council, argued that it will protect women. The federal government has warned state officials that the bill may place Florida out of compliance with federal Medicaid law that bans states from restricting individuals from accessing care from any qualified provider. But it’s unlikely federal officials will consider action until the law goes into effect July 1. Our ruling The Starbucks activist said Scott "stripped women of access to public health care." Scott signed a law this year that cuts off state funding for any clinic that provides abortions, including Planned Parenthood. We heard estimates that it will cut anywhere from $114,000 to $500,000 for Planned Parenthood, which provides other health services to low-income women. It’s possible to wrongly assume from Jennings’ statement that Scott slashed women’s health care services broadly across the state. The cut targets abortion clinics, so it isn’t a cut for health care offices that don’t provide the procedure, such as county health departments. There is some truth to the statement, but it’s too soon to tell exactly how the law will curtail women’s access to publicly supported health care.

pomt-00347	Scott Wallace wants to tax families of five for 'irresponsible breeding'	false	/pennsylvania/statements/2018/sep/14/national-republican-congressional-committee/no-congressional-candidate-scott-wallace-does-not-/	Scott Wallace’s family foundation has caused quite a few headaches for the multimillionaire, who is running for U.S. Congress in Pennsylvania’s 1st District. The GOP and conservative media outlets have used grants made by the Wallace Global Fund, which the candidate led for more than a decade, to paint the Democrat as anti-Israel and anti-police. Wallace will face Republican incumbent Brian Fitzpatrick in a recently redrawn district that includes Bucks County and left-leaning Philly suburbs. A number of stories published this summer by right-leaning outlets focused on grants the foundation made to so-called population control groups. Now, a particularly incendiary claim has made its way into a TV ad created by the National Republican Congressional Committee. The ad claims Wallace "wants to tax families of five for ‘irresponsible breeding.’" The NRCC released a similar web ad that states Wallace "thinks families with more than two children should be ‘taxed to the hilt.’" Does Wallace, who has three children, actually advocate for a multi-child tax? We decided to fact-check the claim. When contacted for comment, NRCC Regional Press Secretary Chris Martin cited a Fox News article from July that reported on the Wallace Global Fund’s donations to groups that advocate limiting population growth. As Fox News reported, the Wallace Global Fund donated money to a group called Zero Population Growth — now known as Population Connection — between 1997 and 2003. From the article: The group, shortly after being founded in 1968, released a brochure advocating abortion to stabilize population growth and claimed that "no responsible family should have more than two children." To deal with larger families, it also called for families to be "taxed to the hilt" for "irresponsible breeding." According to Wallace’s spokesperson, Zoe Wilson-Meyer, the candidate inherited the foundation from his parents in late 2003, after the donations were made. While the foundation's 990 tax form for that year lists Wallace as "president," internal meeting minutes show he was elected to that position in December 2013, according to Wallace Global Fund Executive Director Ellen Dorsey. Regardless of when Wallace took over his family’s foundation, it’s clear that he supports the aims of groups that seek to stabilize population growth through voluntary family planning. His father, the late Robert B. Wallace, was co-chairman of Population Action International, which advocates for increased access to birth control and other family planning methods. "When my generation took over the foundation in 2002 after my parents had both passed away, we developed an increasing focus on the climate crisis, which has only reaffirmed the importance of our population work," Wallace wrote in an essay for the Universal Access Project. "The population trajectory, combined with the inevitable aspirations of people in emerging economies to burn more fossil fuels and own more stuff – just like Americans! – is worse than unsustainable; it’s a pathway to disaster. And population growth won’t abate unless women have access to voluntary family planning, and girls are protected against coerced early marriage and childbearing." Under Wallace’s leadership, the foundation gave grants to Population Action International as well as the Population Council and Worldwatch Institute. The grants were earmarked for purposes including eradicating female genital mutilation, "research on population and the environment," and "global reproductive health and rights," according to the foundation’s Form 990 tax documents. The NRCC’s Martin also pointed to an endorsement for Wallace by the Population Connection Action Fund, the political arm of the group that produced the 1968 brochure. This isn’t the first time the NRCC has tried to link candidates endorsed by the fund to the brochure’s content. As The Morning Call reported, Martin emailed reporters about the organization’s endorsement of Democrat Susan Wild in Pennsylvania’s 7th District: "Out of curiosity, how many children does Susan Wild think families should be able to have before they’re taxed to the hilt?" Brian Dixon, a spokesperson for the Population Connection Action Fund, told the paper, "We do not advocate for increasing taxes on parents of any size family. We believe that parents should have exactly the number of children that they want." Dixon reiterated that statement when contacted by PolitiFact Pennsylvania, adding that he has never seen the 1968 brochure. "Even if it exists, it was written 50 years ago," Dixon said. "The world has changed a lot since." Wallace's campaign spokesperson said he does not personally advocate for a multi-child tax, and PolitiFact Pennsylvania was unable to locate any public records to contradict that statement. Our ruling When Scott Wallace held the reins, the candidate's family foundation awarded grants to nonprofits that advocate for family planning in order to limit population growth worldwide. An NRCC ad attempts to link Wallace to statements made in a 50-year-old brochure produced by a group his family foundation gave money to between 1997 and 2003. But Wallace has never personally called for the taxation of people with more than two children or accused them of "irresponsible breeding." We rate this claim False.

pomt-05945	Republican-leaning states get more in federal dollars than they pay in taxes.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/26/blog-posting/red-state-socialism-graphic-says-gop-leaning-state/	Many GOP-leaning states get more in federal funding than they contribute in federal taxes. That's the point made by a graphic that’s circulating on the Internet, titled "Red State Socialism." A reader recently pointed us to it and asked us to check it out. The chart suggests that Republicans are hypocritical for bashing the federal government and federal spending, when Republican-leaning states are reaping the lion’s share of federal dollars. The graphic emphasizes this point by showing two tables side by side. States that send more money to the federal government than they receive in federal spending are on the left, and they are primarily blue (or Democratic) states. The table on the right shows states that receive more in federal spending than they contribute in taxes. This table is predominantly red (or Republican). The graphic says: "Of the 32 states which receive more than they contribute, 27 states (84%) are REPUBLICAN. Of the 18 states which contribute more than they receive, 14 states (78%) are DEMOCRATIC." The source cited is a report by the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group. We checked with the Tax Foundation to see whether the data was legitimate and confirmed that it is. Spokesman Richard Morrison said that the chart uses 2005 data that was published in 2007. So the graphic is solidly grounded in reality. But we see two reasons for caution when using this chart. How do you define red and blue states? The graphic defines Republican states as those "that have voted Republican in a previous presidential election." Because the data is from 2005, that means states that voted for George W. Bush in 2004, which is a larger number than voted Republican in 2008. But the definition of states as Republican or Democratic isn't immutable. Just four years later, in the 2008 election, six states in the right-hand chart and three states in the left-hand chart switched from Republican to Democratic, making both charts more heavily blue. We should also note that some of the margins of victory were quite narrow. In fact, a dozen or more states can be characterized in most elections as swing states, which might be more appropriately shaded in purple. The data is seven years old As we noted, the data is for 2005. To the author’s credit, this is disclosed prominently, and because it’s the most recent data of its type available, we can hardly fault the creator of the graphic for using it. Still, since the data has almost certainly shifted in the interim, particularly with the 2009 stimulus and the general increase in deficit spending, those patterns could have shifted as well. "Because of the high deficit spending we’re seeing at the federal level, it’s likely that every state is currently receiving more in federal spending than its population paid in federal income taxes," the Tax Foundation's Morrison said. We tracked down the creator of the graphic, Jesse Erlbaum. Erlbaum said he was inspired to create the graphic after watching a presidential debate scene from the television show The West Wing, in which fictional Democratic President Jed Bartlet needles his Republican opponent, the governor of Florida, for seeming to diminish the importance of federal funds that his state receives. Erlbaum said he created the graphic "for fun" in October 2008, just before Barack Obama won the presidency. "Based on that, I selected the most recent previous presidential election cycle, namely 2004." That explains the chart’s use of older electoral data; it simply hasn’t been updated by subsequent posters. Erlbaum conceded the concerns we laid out. "It's definitely true that choosing a different election cycle and basis for assigning red versus blue will produce different results," he said. As for the age of the data, Erlbaum said, "I would love to see an update of this report." Erlbaum added, "I've listened to feedback about this chart for a few years now, and folks who don't like the insinuation it makes will always come up with some explanation. Popular ones are that there are more military jobs, more retirees, more farmers, and fewer cities in red states. I don't buy it. Whatever the excuse, the data is clear: These states receive more than they pay in. Everything else is just a rationalization based on someone deciding that one reason for spending money is good, and another is bad. This chart makes no such distinction. I say, ‘Deal with it!’ The facts are the facts." Our ruling The graphic’s data uses data from the 2004 election rather than 2008, and the figures on taxes and spending date back to 2005. There are fewer states that would be labeled Republican based on the 2008 election, and there’s a strong likelihood that tax and spending data would have changed as well. Because of this likelihood, we downgrade the accuracy of this generally accurate chart to Mostly True.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2012-01-26T17:37:19	2012-01-26	['None']
pomt-00333	"Arnold Schwarzenegger: 'I would be a better president than Trump ...2020 wait for me do you agree??"	false	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/sep/18/blog-posting/did-arnold-schwarzenegger-say-he-would-be-better-p/	A website called the Colorado Post claims that actor and former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said he would do a better job than President Donald Trump. "Arnold Schwarzenegger: ‘I would be a better president than Trump ...2020 wait for me do you agree??’" said the headline of a Sept. 9 story posted on coloradopost.site, which doesn’t appear to be affiliated with the newspaper Denver Post. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We could not find a verbatim quote of Schwarzenegger saying, "I would be a better president than Trump ...2020 wait for me do you agree??" In February 2017 Schwarzenegger, a vocal Trump critic, suggested that he and Trump switch jobs. "Hey, Donald, I have a great idea: why don’t we switch jobs, you take over TV, because you’re such an expert in ratings and I take over your job and then people can finally sleep comfortably again, hmm?" Schwarzenegger said in a video posted on Twitter. Text in Schwarzenegger’s tweet said, "The National Prayer Breakfast?" That day Trump delivered a speech at the National Prayer Breakfast and mocked Schwarzenegger for low ratings on the NBC show The Apprentice. Trump in January 2017 also taunted Schwarzenegger’s ratings compared to Trump’s time on the show. In response to that tweet, Schwarzenegger tweeted: "I wish you the best of luck and I hope you'll work for ALL of the American people as aggressively as you worked for your ratings." Beyond Colorado Post’s headline, there’s no indication in the story of when or where Schwarzenegger purportedly said that he would be a better president than Trump — and to wait for him in 2020. (Schwarzenegger is ineligible for the U.S. presidency since he is not a natural-born U.S. citizen. He was born in Austria.) The story rather talked about the causes and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and said Schwarzenegger "definitely hates Trump." "Shocking confession of Arnold Schwarzenegger made us think of his big hate," the story said. "A few day (sic) ago we say headlines of him telling Trump has PTSD." Coloradopost.site does not include any information on its website detailing who’s behind it or a way to contact its operators. (There are fields to post a comment to the story.) We found no evidence of Schwarzenegger saying exactly what the site claims — including to wait for him in 2020. Making up quotes, even if the some of the sentiment has been expressed before, is a big no-no. We rate the headline False.

pomt-13432	"Texas has lost the most law enforcement officers in the line of duty of any state in America."	true	/texas/statements/2016/sep/19/charley-wilkison/texas-top-state-law-enforcement-deaths-line-duty/	After the July 2016 ambush shootings of five Dallas police officers, there was much discussion about the dangers of police work and if (or how) the shootings, which also wounded nine officers and two civilians, might damage police-community relations. Amid the talk, the Texas Standard, a weekday public-radio program that airs around Texas, drew a claim to U.S. history from Charley Wilkison of the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas (CLEAT), a law enforcement advocacy and lobbying group. Laura Rice, interviewing Wilkison, said: "I wondered if there’s been sort of a heightened sense of fear since Dallas or if officers are also kind of feeling an outpouring of support from communities." Wilkison, CLEAT’s executive director, replied: "I think there’s a heightened sense of reality because the fear part, of course officers are trained to deal with that. But Texas has lost the most -- and I say that every time you guys invite me on -- Texas has lost the most law enforcement officers in the line of duty of any state in America. So that’s absolutely something they (police officers) are aware of coming into the job, coming into the profession." We wondered if Texas truly is No. 1 by this unfortunate indicator. By phone when we inquired, Wilkison told us his statement was based on figures from the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement (TCOLE). He also texted a photo of an ad CLEAT posted to the May 2016 edition of American Police Beat which stated that 1,959 Texas officers had been killed in the line of duty. To our inquiry, the commission’s Ken Mobley, said in an email that the names of "1,955 law enforcement officers are on the Texas Peace Officer Memorial. These are the individuals who were approved by the commission as per TCOLE rules of eligibility, some (individuals) dating back to the early 1800s." Wilkison’s figure turned out to be higher than other counts we found of law enforcement deaths for Texas though two other analyses support the notion that Texas leads in officer deaths. As of Sept. 7, 2016, when we looked, the Officer Down Memorial Page (ODMP) -- which was cited by Wilkison and others as a data source and is curated by a nonprofit that says it’s dedicated to honoring America's fallen law enforcement heroes -- listed Texas’ count at 1,866 officer deaths (plus 12 deaths of K9 dogs) across 27 cause-of-death categories: SOURCE: Web page, "Texas Line of Duty Deaths," Officer Down Memorial Page, (accessed Sept. 7, 2016) The group’s Texas tally, which considered deaths as far back as 1837 (before statehood), folded in 1,096 deaths by gunfire including the 1930 death of Uvalde Chief of Police John F. Connor and the July 2016 deaths in Dallas. Another 61 Texas deaths, from 1858 through 2007, were attributed to accidental gunfire. Among other populous states, per the group, California and New York had lost 1,569 and 1,568 officers, respectively, in the line of duty; Illinois had sustained 1,070 such deaths; and Florida had tallied 757 line-of-duty deaths. Seeking other counts, a web search led us to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund (NLEOMF), which says it’s dedicated to honoring and remembering the service and sacrifice of U.S. law enforcement officers and that as of March 24, 2016, Texas had sustained 1,682 law enforcement deaths--compared to 1,571 in California, 1,375 in New York and 1,013 in Illinois. To our inquiry, a fund spokesman, Steve Groeniger, told us by phone that Wilkison got it right about Texas having the most law enforcement deaths. The fund says on its "law enforcement facts" web page: "New York City has lost more officers in the line of duty than any other department, with 705 deaths. Texas has lost 1,682 officers, more than any other state. The state with the fewest deaths is Vermont, with 23." Groeniger also mentioned the FBI’s Law Enforcement Officers Killed or Assaulted (LEOKA), collected as part of their Uniform Crime Statistics. According to emailed figures provided by Stephen Fischer of the FBI, some 457 officer deaths in Texas since 1980 led other states and accounted for nearly 10 percent of 4,736 officer deaths nationally. California followed closely behind with 436 deaths. Our ruling Wilkison said: "Texas has lost the most law enforcement officers in the line of duty of any state in America." This appears to be so, both of late (since 1980) and since the 1800s. We rate the claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

pomt-06145	Says Oregon canned blueberries will be cheaper in South Korea thanks to a trade agreement.	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2011/dec/20/ron-wyden/will-free-trade-deal-drop-price-oregon-canned-blue/	U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden held up a can of Oregon Fruit Products blueberries at the Oregon Business Summit last week as an example of the state’s market expansion abroad. The berries are picked in the Willamette Valley, packed in light syrup and, according to Wyden, will be less costly for South Koreans thanks to a recent trade agreement. "Because of the Korean free trade agreement, South Koreans who want Oregon blueberries are gonna see their prices go down because we will be getting rid of a 45 percent tariff on this Oregon product," he said. "That's what I mean when I'm talking about expanding trade." As we’ve previously noted, sometimes we check a statement because it strikes us as wrong. Other times, we just want to learn more. And in this case, we just wanted to know more about the trade agreement and how it might affect Oregon products, in this case, our plump, nutritious, not-too-sweet blueberries. The pact, years in the negotiating, should make it easier to sell U.S. products to 49 million consumers in South Korea. Tariffs imposed on U.S. goods will be phased out or eliminated outright. So, the 40 percent tariff on U.S. muscle beef will be eliminated over 15 years. Fresh cherries, with its 24 percent tariff, will be duty-free as soon as the pact is in effect. The same goes for dried apricots, wine and grape juice. The tariff on canned blueberries is now 45 percent, as Wyden said. Unlike the tax on fresh cherries, the tax on canned blueberries will be phased out to zero over a decade. In 2012, the tariff will drop to 40.5 percent and in 2013, the tariff will be 36 percent. In 2016, the tariff will be 22.50 percent and in 2021, zero percent. It’s not clear when the new tariff rate will kick in. Dalton Hobbs, assistant director of the Oregon Department of Agriculture, says that while the pact technically is in effect now, practically speaking it’s not. "People who were waiting for this are probably going to sit on the sidelines for another few weeks until all of the mechanisms are fully in place for products to move," he said. South Korea is Oregon’s fifth largest export market, accounting for nearly $1 billion in sales last year. Hobbs estimates that Oregon producers will see an increase in sales in the $50 million to $100 million range over the next 12 months. That should increase significantly, Hobbs said. We asked Joseph Peterson, the president of Oregon Fruit Products, whether he anticipated a cost reduction for South Korean consumers. He explained that his sell price will stay the same, because the burden of the tariff is borne by the importer, and eventually the consumer. "As that duty goes away, the importer's cost will be less," he said. The price reduction "should go all the way to the consumer." We called the Office of the United States Trade Representative to see how eliminating a tariff over the longer term usually affects the price of the commodity. "Tariff reductions should lower prices of those goods receiving the tariff reductions," Carol Guthrie, an official at the office, said in an e-mail. "The price reduction may not equal the tariff reduction on a one-to-one basis (the issue of whether companies fully pass through the savings to the final consumer). "If consumer prices have gone up due to inflation, etc over the phase in period, then these prices would have been even higher if the tariffs were not reduced." Already, 2011 has been a landmark year for Oregon blueberries in South Korea. In a separate move, food officials there have authorized for import the first ever fresh blueberries from the United States. Of course, they will come from Oregon. By next summer, our blueberries should join berries from British Columbia and Chile in Korean markets. "Korea is just wild for blueberries, dermal cream, food products, it’s in other items as well, blueberry shampoo, all manner of consumer goods," says Bryan Ostlund, executive director of the Oregon Blueberry Commission in Salem. But we digress. In a printed version of the speech circulated by Wyden’s office, the senator was supposed to hold up the can of blueberries and say that "South Koreans who want Oregon blueberries are now paying 45 percent less per can." It’s a good thing he didn’t end up saying that. Such a statement would have been False. But what Wyden said is fairly accurate. It makes sense that South Koreans who want canned blueberries from Oregon should see prices go down -- or not increase as much -- over time, because the tariff on the product will decrease. But the tariff is going to be phased in slowly, so the full savings are still a ways off. We think Wyden’s statement needs that clarification. Based on our findings, we rate the statement Mostly True: accurate but needing additional information. Let us know what you think, by heading over to OregonLive and leaving a comment.

pomt-12534	Images show the turnout for President Donald Trump's 2017 ceremony with the New England Patriots was smaller than the team’s turnout with President Barack Obama in 2015.	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2017/apr/20/new-york-times/new-york-times-tweet-fumbles-comparisons-patriots-/	The New York Times faced criticism after implying in a tweet that far fewer members of the New England Patriots football team attended a White House visit with President Donald Trump than just two years ago with President Barack Obama. The newspaper’s sports account sent out a tweet that linked to a story about how fewer Patriots players were at the 2017 ceremony than in prior years. The tweet included the following images, and was sent out at 4:25 p.m. Eastern on April 19, 2017: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The top image is the team’s trip to the White House on April 23, 2015, to celebrate the Patriots’ victory in Super Bowl XLIX. The bottom image is their April 19 visit for their come-from-behind win in Super Bowl LI. The post was retweeted almost 49,000 times. The photos appear to show that a mere fraction of the team showed up to visit Trump, compared to the sprawling entourage that visited Obama. The comparison recalled the January 2017 dispute over images showing smaller crowds for Trump’s inauguration than for Obama’s 2009 swearing-in. But while several players were absent from the 2017 visit, it’s difficult to fairly compare the two photographs. The 2015 photo showed the team and its administrative staff, while the 2017 photo did not. The Patriots pointed this out at 8:45 p.m. the same day, noting that more than 40 staff members were seated instead of lining the staircases, forcing the New York Times to backpeddle a bit. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Why no photo with the entire staff this year? "That’s just what the White House chose to do," team spokesman Stacey James told the Boston Globe. The Patriots provided the Globe with a photo the team had tweeted of the ceremony’s rehearsal that did include more than 100 players and staffers. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Another tweet from the team included images that the Patriots said were a fair comparison by showing only the players and not the full staff. That example included a photo of the team visiting President George W. Bush on May 10, 2004. The New York Times updated its tweet by noting that the Patriots said 34 players visited in 2017 and 50 attended in 2015, but the total number of team and staff was "roughly the same." The newspaper’s story noted that several key Patriots players like LeGarrette Blount, Chris Long, Alan Branch, Dont’a Hightower, Martellus Bennett and Devin McCourty had stayed away specifically because they did not support Trump. Patriots owner Robert Kraft and head coach Bill Belichick have described themselves as Trump’s friends. So has quarterback Tom Brady, who had announced in a statement before the gathering that he would be absent because of "personal family matters." Brady also skipped the 2015 ceremony. NESN Patriots reporter Doug Kyed tweeted out a list of players who did not attend the ceremony before the New York Times story published. We attempted to contact both the New York Times and the Patriots via phone and email, but neither responded with any comment beyond prior public statements. Another element to the attendance appears to be that, well, it’s just not all that special for a team that’s won five Super Bowls since 2002 to visit the White House. The New York Times story provided figures from James, who said 45 players went to the White House in 2002, when Bush was president, closer to 2015’s 50 players. But in 2004 and 2005, the players numbered closer to this week’s 34 player attendees. (WBZ-TV sports anchor Dan Roche tweeted 36 players went in 2004, and just 27 in 2005.) New York Times sports editor Jason Stallman took responsibility for the deflating juxtaposition in an emailed statement to the Washington Post: "Bad tweet by me. Terrible tweet. I wish I could say it’s complicated, but no, this one is pretty straightforward: I’m an idiot. It was my idea, it was my execution, it was my blunder. I made a decision in about four minutes that clearly warranted much more time. "Once we learned more, we tried to fix everything as much as possible as swiftly as possible and as transparently as possible. Of course, at that point the damage was done. I just needed to own it." Even so, Trump took to his Twitter account the next morning to accuse the Times of lying: See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com The White House had no further comment when we contacted a spokesman. Our ruling The New York Times’ comparison made it appear the turnout for President Donald Trump's 2017 ceremony with the New England Patriots was smaller than the team’s turnout with President Barack Obama in 2015. While many Patriots players did skip the April 19 ceremony, some to avoid Trump, the use of the images together made a false equivalency. The 2015 photo shows not just players, but also Patriots staff members, while the 2017 photo does not. The New York Times updated their tweet and story, and the sports editor has apologized. While fewer players showed up at this year’s White House ceremony, it wasn’t drastically different than similar situations in prior years. If we’re talking just players, the team has said 34 players visited in 2017, compared to 50 in 2015. This claim rates Mostly False.

pomt-12199	Wisconsin is "dead-last in creating new businesses" for "three years in a row."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jul/26/andy-gronik/half-true-attack-scott-walker-and-if-wisconsin-3-y/	On the day he announced his run for governor of Wisconsin, Democrat and political newcomer Andy Gronik attacked Republican Gov. Scott Walker in an interview on WTMJ-AM in Milwaukee. The afternoon drive-time host, John Mercure, asked Gronik on July 11, 2017 how he would pay for his proposal to provide free college to needy students who have good grades, and how much Gronik’s idea would cost. The suburban Milwaukee businessman responded by making statistical claims criticizing Walker’s record on jobs, including this one: "We are 50th out of 50 states -- so we're dead last in creating new businesses in the state of Wisconsin for three years in a row." That would be a strong counter to Walker’s frequent boasts about how the state’s unemployment rate has dropped during his time as governor. It’s also a claim Gronik made in two other interviews. Let’s see if he’s right. Counting isn’t necessarily simple It’s worth noting at the top that even a simple count of new businesses isn’t necessarily simple. While running for governor in 2010, Walker promised to create 10,000 new businesses during his first term. Near the end of the term, the number of registered business entities had risen by more than 25,000. But we found the count of registered businesses is a general economic indicator with severe limitations. The count includes not only new ventures that bring new jobs, but thousands of entities with no workers on the payroll at all -- and little if any prospect of hires to come. Those include hundreds of nonprofits such as Scout troops and thousands of limited-liability companies set up by real-estate investors solely to hold ownership of property or properties. As we’ll see, Gronik’s claim also has issues. Gronik’s evidence To back Gronik’s claim, his campaign referred us to a May 2017 news article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on the 2017 Kauffman Index of Startup Activity. The index is produced by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, one of the country’s leading entrepreneurship advocacy and research organizations. Wisconsin did, in fact, rank last among the 50 states in 2015, 2016 and 2017 in startup activity, according to the index. But the Kauffman index is not simply a count of new business creations, which is what Gronik’s claim is about -- it is a combination of three measures that Kauffman thinks are important in assessing startup activity. One measure is the number of startup firms less than a year old that employed at least one person for every 1,000 such businesses in the state. The other two measures are the percentage of adults who become entrepreneurs and the percentage of new entrepreneurs who started businesses primarily because they saw a market opportunity, rather than because they were unemployed. Wisconsin ranked last because its overall index for the three measures (-3.65) was the lowest -- significantly below Alabama, the 49th-ranked state, at -2.69. Nevada ranked No. 1, at 3.22. We found two more narrowly tailored federal data sets that help evaluate Gronik’s statement. BLS rankings When we posed Gronik’s statement to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the agency suggested we look at its data on "establishment births" -- the number of new businesses created in a particular year -- as a percentage of all business establishments in each state. Wisconsin does better on this measure, ranking near the middle. The most recent figures show that for the first three quarters of 2016, new establishments accounted for 6.7 percent of all business establishments in Wisconsin, a rank of 29th, according to our calculations. It ranked 34th in 2015 and 32nd in 2014. Census rankings We were also directed to U.S. Census Bureau data on new businesses that had employees. But it is less useful, given that the latest data is for 2014. For 2014, Wisconsin ranked 44th when considering the percentage of firms in the state that were created during that year. A firm is defined as a business that has one or more establishments. Viewed another way, Wisconsin ranked 46th for the percentage of establishments that were opened in 2014. An establishment is a single location where business is done. (The BLS data is collected from administrative records and cover a wider spectrum of business establishments. The Census data is collected using a survey and covers a more limited set of businesses.) Our rating Gronik said Wisconsin is "dead last in creating new businesses" for "three years in a row." He’s correct when citing the 2015, 2016 and 2017 rankings from the respected nonprofit Kauffman Index on Startup Activity. But that index, while it takes into account what portion of a state’s businesses were created in a given year, also considers two other variables. So, it supports Gronik’s statement only to a point. Conversely, Wisconsin ranked between 29th and 34th for 2014 through 2016, according to the latest figures from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Those rankings are based strictly on the percentage of a state’s business establishments that were created in each year.

pomt-13047	Says climate scientist James Hansen says "we have until perhaps 50 years from now," or maybe a little longer "and at that point, we are looking at 10, 20, 30 feet of sea-level rise."	false	/texas/statements/2016/nov/23/jill-stein/jill-stein-overstates-forecast-about-seas-rising-3/	Presidential candidate Jill Stein told a boisterous Texas crowd that a respected scientist foresees the loss of coastal cities within a half century due to creeping seas. "In this election, we’re not just deciding what kind of a world we will have, but whether we will have a world or not going forward," Stein said Oct. 17, 2016 at a forum at Austin’s Huston-Tillotson University. As of mid-November 2016, with some votes left to be counted, Stein appeared to have drawn about 1 percent nationally in her second run as the presidential nominee of the Green Party, which emphasizes environmental sustainability. Its party platform describes environmentalism and justice as intertwined and calls for "an ecological society that is harmonized with nature." Stein said at the forum: "Jim Hansen, the father of climate science; he hasn’t been wrong yet in about 40 years of climate science. And his latest predictions are that, folks, we have until perhaps 50 years from now — maybe a little bit longer, but maybe not. And at that point, we are looking at 10, 20, 30 feet of sea level rise which means goodbye to population centers on the coasts." Of the nation’s 50 most populous cities, 16 lie in part at sea level, according to the US Geological Survey. The cities include New York, Miami, Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Baltimore, Portland and Seattle. Scientists have attributed sea-level rise to the melting of glaciers and ice caps, caused by the Earth’s warming atmosphere. In July 2013, PolitiFact rated True a claim by U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., that sea levels measured in Florida had risen nine inches since the 1920s, finding corroborating historical data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The agency attributes the rising seas to a combination of thermal expansion (because warm water expands) and melting ice. Then again, nine inches is a whole lot less than 10 to 30 feet. So, did a top climate scientist predict that much of a sea-level rise in about 50 years? We emailed the Stein campaign for the nominee's backup information but didn’t hear back. Otherwise, a Google search led us to think Stein was citing James Hansen, the climate scientist who testified to Congress about global warming in 1988 while he was director of NASA’s Institute for Space Studies; in that testimony, he warned of resultant heat waves and droughts to come, not of rising seas swallowing cities. We noticed too that Stein made a similar claim in an Aug. 10, 2016 Twitter post warning about Americans losing homes due to a nine-foot sea-level rise by 2050. At the time, Stein spokeswoman Meleiza Figueroa said Hansen was the candidate’s source. An Aug. 17, 2016, Washington Post news story went on to characterize the nine-foot figure as a possibility, not a prediction, also saying that the prospect "doesn’t represent a scientific consensus." Hansen’s hypothesis For our part, we emailed Hansen, who works for Columbia University’s Earth Institute, to run Stein’s claim by him. He wrote back that he has forecasted "multi-meter sea level rise" in 50 to 150 years, which he wrote "means loss of most coastal cities." Hansen also pointed us to a study he co-authored with 18 fellow scientists from the U.S., China and Europe, published March 22, 2016, in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics. The 52-page study flatly predicts the 50-to-150 year timeframe for sea-level rise. Yet it ties that expectation to the authors’ hypothesis that polar ice caps will melt drastically faster than what had been estimated by that time by most scientific studies. The study repeatedly warns of potential rise by "several meters," we noticed, but doesn’t have specific figures equal to the 10-to-30 foot range declared by Stein. The study also acknowledges that the data used to test the authors’ hypothesis were imperfect, making the implications uncertain. Researchers, the study says, used "coarse-resolution modeling and simplifying assumptions" and so "raises fundamental questions that point towards specific modeling and measurement needs." It also states "the record is too short to confirm the nature of the response"--meaning there’s too little data to know for sure how quickly the ice caps will melt. We’re sharing next more detail about the basis of the hypothesis and the authors’ related conclusions. The study, drawing on computer models taking into account ancient climate data revealed by ocean sediment cores plus more recent observations of ice melt, ocean currents and global surface temperatures, specifically hypothesizes that the ice caps will melt at an exponential, as opposed to linear, rate. Under that scenario, the study posits, the volume of discharged meltwater would double every 10, 20 or 40 years. Still, the authors note, "the record is too short to confirm" which timeframe will prove out, though limited modern observations put it nearer to 10 years, they say. "If (greenhouse gas) emissions continue to grow" (which they were as of 2011, according to federal data published in 2015), the study says, "multi-meter sea level rise would become practically unavoidable, probably within 50-150 years." The study says: "Social disruption and economic consequences of such large sea-level rise, and the attendant increases in storms and climate extremes, could be devastating. It is not difficult to imagine that conflicts arising from forced migrations and economic collapse might make the planet ungovernable, threatening the fabric of civilization." The Hansen-led study drew wide attention at its debut with some experts saying the conclusions were speculative rather than certain. On March 22, 2016, the New York Times ran a story headlined, "Scientists warn of perilous climate shift within decades, not centuries," and the Post wrote, "We had all better hope these scientists are wrong about the planet’s future." A main point of those news stories: the possibilities raised by Hansen and his co-authors overstepped the accepted spectrum for projected sea-level rise in existing scientific literature. Other sea level forecasts Other prominent predictions: --The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2013 forecasted sea level rise between 0.6 and one meter by 2100. --In 2014, the U.S. National Climate Assessment, a federal project, predicted between one and four feet of sea level rise by the century’s end, about 0.3-1.2 m. --The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, in its plans for incorporating sea level change into civil works construction, holds that "a credible upper bound for 21st Century sea-level rise would not exceed 2 meters. So, Hansen and others indeed made bold predictions. But the predictions were based on a hypothesized phenomenon of exponential ice cap melt. Other researchers Next, we turned to outside experts for interpretation. We looked up Climate Central, a New Jersey-based a New Jersey-based organization of scientists studying climate change, and emailed the head of sea level research there, Benjamin Strauss, to inquire if Hansen’s researcher seemed credible. Asked about Stein’s claim that Hansen hasn’t been wrong in 40 years, Strauss said Hansen "is definitely one of the greatest heroes of climate science, and he has often been prescient, but everyone makes mistakes." Regarding the March 2016 study, Strauss said it "was far outside the mainstream of climate or sea level science. It was very provocative, and coming from him it must be taken seriously, but specialists were and remain extremely skeptical of its projections and conclusions." We wondered what could set Hansen’s conclusions so far apart from the accepted projections. Per our reading, public discussions posted online and other news analyses, it was largely based on a hypothesized snowball effect in ice cap melting. The study said that as freshwater poured off melting polar ice, it would form a cap atop the relatively heavy ocean saltwater; that would suppress vertical currents that bring polar sea water to the surface to cool, thereby warming the ocean subsurface, speeding melting at the deepest levels of the ice caps and increasing the rate of freshwater runoff. When Hansen emailed, he also pointed out the extensive public review process posted online. There, we found commentary from other researchers on the study. Peter Thorne, director of the Irish Climate Analysis and Research Units at Maynooth University in Ireland, left a 12-page review in which he addressed the proposed snowball effect of ice cap melt. The hypothesis, he wrote, "relies to an uncomfortable extent upon a causal chain of the nature given a then b and because b then c and c means that d shall occur etc. Each link in the chain is certainly plausible based upon the relatively scant evidence at hand, but it is not by any stretch determinant." Thorne also wrote: "At the same time, however, it would be foolish in extremis to discount this out of hand as a possibility of what shall occur" because "we do not know enough about the earth system as a whole" and "I share many of the author’s manifestly obvious concerns" about the dangerous implications of a warming climate. Texas state climatologist By email, we ran the densely-worded study by Texas state climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon, a professor of meteorology at Texas A&M University. Nielsen-Gammon replied that the study's mention of sea level rise amounted to more of a "statement of the possible" as opposed to an actual sea-level-rise prediction." He wrote that he read the study and explained that Hansen and the team hypothesized an exponential increase in meltwater discharge, then tested the hypothesis using observed meltwater rates for Greenland and Antarctica. He said the authors "concluded that the observed record was too short to determine whether meltwater discharge is increasing exponentially, let alone what the time scale of increase is, though the data is consistent with their hypothesized rapid exponential increase." Hansen acknowledged as much in a 15-minute video he released in conjunction with the paper on March 21, 2016. Hansen said in the video: "The data records are too short, but if we wait until the real world reveals itself clearly, it may be too late to avoid sea-level rise of several meters and loss of all coastal cities." If the volume of discharged meltwater doubles in ten years, he said in the video, seas could rise one meter in about 50 years; if the volume doubles in 20 years, seas could rise one meter in about 100 years. Our ruling Stein said Hansen predicted 10 to 30 feet of sea-level rise within 50 years or "maybe a little bit longer." Hansen published startling predictions exceeding established forecasts of sea-level rise related to climate change. But even under the most urgent scenario, the Hansen-led study projects about one meter—3.3 feet—of sea-level rise in 50 years. It projects, with some admitted uncertainty, multi-meter sea-level rise within 50 to 150 years. We rate Stein’s claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-15029	"Remember that developers are forced to use the ‘195 land union’ contractors, so tap an extra $10 million into any construction project."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2015/oct/04/john-depetro/depetro-dead-wrong-about-unions-and-195-land/	The demise of the Pawsox’s Providence stadium proposal is a glaring case of union-friendly government policy stifling development, according to John DePetro. The "Red Sox baseball people" — who wanted to build a stadium on 195 land — were "no match for the ‘Allens Avenue’ gang" and they "underestimated the greed of the locals," the WPRO talk show host wrote in his Sept. 20 blog posted on DePetro.com. "Remember that developers are forced to use the `195 land union’ contractors, so tap an extra $10 million into any construction project." Are developers actually required to employ union workers for construction on property created by the relocation of Route 195? And does it cost an "extra $10 million" for "any construction project"? Yes, DePetro said when we reached him, "100 percent true." He told us that a "PLA," a project labor agreement for the development of the 195 land, requires the use of union labor for construction. Just check with the I-195 Redevelopment District Commission, said DePetro, who also said that he would try to provide a copy of the PLA. "I know that it’s in existence." Dyana Koelsch, spokeswoman for the commission, told us the commission is not aware of any requirement that obligates developers to use union labor. At DePetro’s suggestion, we contacted Robert J. Boisselle, president of the Rhode Island chapter of Associated Builders & Contractors, a nationwide association. The association represents 22,000 "open shop" construction companies that function without union labor. And like DePetro, Boisselle’s organization believes that union contractors unnecessarily add to the cost of a construction project, by 12 percent to 18 percent. Boisselle also cited a 2011 research paper produced by the law firm Venable LLP, which looked at projects across the country, including the Big Dig in Boston. But is union labor really required on the former Route 195 property? DePetro is sure of it. Boisselle isn’t sure: "I have not seen a document or a piece of paper that has said any projects down on the 195 land will have a PLA, but I have heard that from many sources." Our next stop was Greg Mancini, executive director of BuildRI, which promotes unionized construction labor. Mancini, who is a lawyer, told us there is "no special legal requirement at the federal, state or local level that mandates" the use of union labor on the former Route 195 land. "There’s absolutely nothing," he said, adding that it would be illegal for either the state or the commission to impose a requirement on developers’ privately owned construction sites. Further, when asked to respond to Boisselle’s comments on union labor costs, Mancini said he would not make a broad statement about the comparative cost of union labor. He said many developers have told his organization that unionized workers completed the job safely, on time and on budget. We also talked to Michael Sabitoni, president of the Rhode Island Building and Construction Trades Council, about DePetro’s statement. "He couldn’t be more misinformed," Sabitoni said. Finally, we doubled back to DePetro, to let him know that the commission says there is nothing that forces developers to hire union labor on the former Route 195 land. DePetro dismissed the information from Koelsch, the commission spokeswoman, pointing to the way the hotel workers’ union has mustered opposition to a new hotel in the Fogarty Building, downtown. "Why? No labor agreement with hotel workers, so no hotel. In theory, one should be able to build a hotel in Providence, but in reality they cannot," he wrote. "I deal in real Rhode Island," he said in an email. "You are buying the Chamber of Commerce BS." Our ruling On his blog, DePetro wrote: "Remember that developers are forced to use the ‘195 land union’ contractors, so tap an extra $10 million into any construction project." DePetro was in Pants on Fire territory. But the state has entered into PLAs in the past. Construction unions are influential and the state can decide to only hire union-labor contractors for work on state land. The I-I95 commission, however, has no such requirement. Because of that, the business about $10 million in extra costs for "any construction project," is irrelevant, in addition to being unsubstantiated in the original version of the blog. So "100 percent true"? Not even close. We rate this ruling False.	None	John DePetro	None	None	None	2015-10-04T00:00:00	2015-09-20	['None']

pomt-09874	"53 percent of Americans cut back on their health care in the last year because of costs."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/30/bill-pascrell/pascrell-says-53-percent-americans-cut-back-health/	The debate over reforming the U.S. health care system has inspired a torrent of often conflicting statistics. We will look at three assertions made by Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey. In this item, we will test his assertion that 53 percent of Americans cut back on their health care in the last year because of costs. On July 28, 2009, Pascrell took to the House floor to counter assertions by Republicans and others that a Democratic bill under consideration in the chamber would lead to the rationing of health care. Pascrell’s larger point was that rationing already exists today, just a different type — thanks to the financial barriers to coverage faced by millions of Americans. Specifically, Pascrell said: “Forty-five percent of Americans went without needed care because of costs in this country in 2007. That’s rationing. Fifty-three percent of Americans cut back on their health care in the last year because of costs. That’s rationing. … As many as 22,000 Americans die each year because they don’t have health insurance. My brothers and sisters, that’s rationing.” We are not going to weigh in on the question of whether it’s fair to equate Pascrell’s examples of “rationing” with what the bill’s critics charge the bill would do if enacted. Rather, we wanted to gauge whether Pascrell’s numbers were sound. So we looked at these three claims individually. Pascrell’s second claim is based on a tracking poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, which is a respected, independent source of data on health policy. Pascrell chose a survey result from February, when the foundation sponsored a poll of 1,204 randomly sampled adults ages 18 and over. All told, 53 percent said that they or a family member in their household had done one of the following things because of cost concerns: relied on home remedies or over-the-counter drugs instead of going to see a doctor (35 percent said yes); skipped dental care or checkups (34 percent); put off or postponed getting health care you needed (27 percent); skipped a recommended medical test or treatment (23 percent); not filled a prescription (21 percent); cut pills in half or skipped doses (15 percent); or had problems getting mental health care (7 percent). What Pascrell or his staff apparently wasn’t aware of was that the same survey has subsequently been repeated three more times — that’s the purpose of a tracking poll, after all — and that, in fact, the percentage of respondents saying they had done one of those things has jumped around quite a bit. In April, the number rose to 59 percent, before falling to 55 percent in June and 49 percent in July. Another point to note: Not all of the actions mentioned to survey respondents are equally damaging, which suggests that the 53 percent figure ought to be taken with a grain of salt. Taking over-the-counter drugs for a temporary condition such as a cold might not be very risky; indeed, for minor illnesses such as colds that doctors aren’t able to treat well anyway, some health care economists would be delighted to see Americans skipping a visit to the doctor. Moreover, the poll data shows that Americans who did scale back their visits seemed to have the right priorities. Of the 27 percent of respondents in the February poll who answered “yes” to the question about putting off needed health care, the two most common items skipped were “a visit to the doctor for a temporary illness, such as a cold or stomach flu” and “preventive care such as a yearly physical exam,” both at 19 percent. Lower rates were recorded for more urgent situations, including a visit for a chronic condition such as diabetes or asthma (10 percent), minor surgery (6 percent) or major surgery (5 percent). Cathy Schoen, a senior vice president with the Commonwealth Fund, agreed that the results on chronic conditions are especially important. “Health plans have started to notice this, as have some employers, and they are lowering cost-shares for essential and effective medications, especially generics,” she said. “Otherwise, plans are seeing an increase in emergency room or hospital visits for complications, which mean higher costs.” Schoen added, “Fortunately most people are healthy each year: The healthiest 50 percent of the population accounts for only 3 percent of all spending. The sickest 10 percent account for 64 percent of all spending. This is where timely and appropriate medical care can make a difference.” Finally, the survey wording raises a bit of a red flag. Pascrell said that 53 percent of Americans “cut back on their health care in the last year because of costs,” a number that reflects anyone who cited one of the seven possible actions offered to respondents. But Pascrell’s statement is not far off from one of those seven offerings, a rather broadly worded question that asked respondents whether they had “put off or postponed getting health care you needed.” That question drew a yes from 27 percent of respondents, well below the 53 percent Pascrell chose to cite. Pascrell accurately conveyed the survey’s topline figure, but he did use old numbers (figures that have varied a bit in subsequent months) and the survey provides other data that make the problem seem less dire than the headline number indicates. We rate his assertion Half True.	None	Bill Pascrell	None	None	None	2009-07-30T17:27:02	2009-07-28	['United_States']
pomt-03672	"Not one dime gets added to the deficit because of Social Security."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/apr/26/mark-pocan/social-security-doesnt-add-federal-deficit-us-rep-/	In a move that upset liberals, President Barack Obama proposed in his 2014 budget a change to something called "chained CPI," which would result in smaller increases in future Social Security benefits. Among those objecting -- at a news conference outside the White House a day before Obama officially made the proposal -- was U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis. The freshman congressman elaborated on his position a week later, in an April 16, 2013 interview with John "Sly" Sylvester, a liberal talk show host on WEKZ-FM (93.7) outside of Madison. And he made this statement: "Social Security didn't cause our deficit. Not one dime gets added to the deficit because of Social Security. It's not allowed to, by law." The one-dime claim -- likely to be repeated in one form or another as Congress debates Obama’s proposal -- is about as absolute as it gets. Is Pocan right? ‘Chained CPI’ Currently, cost-of-living adjustments to Social Security benefits are calculated using the traditional Consumer Price Index, a measure of overall inflation. Obama wants to switch to the so-called chained CPI, which some analysts believe is a more accurate measure. It accounts for how people change their behavior when costs rise -- if the price of pasta goes up, you might buy cheaper rice instead. Chained CPI would save the government some money because it would trigger smaller Social Security benefit increases than the traditional CPI. If chained CPI were put in place in 2014, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the average Social Security benefits would be roughly 2 percent lower -- $30 a month -- by 2023. Pocan’s evidence Pocan, a former state legislator, arrived in Congress in January 2013. He won election to the House seat vacated by Democrat Tammy Baldwin, who ran successfully for the U.S. Senate. To support Pocan’s claim, Pocan spokesman Samuel Lau cited federal documents from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and Congressional Research Service to make two points: 1. Social Security runs a surplus, and therefore doesn’t contribute to the overall federal deficit. 2. Social Security benefits can be paid only from the Social Security trust fund, not general funds. But there is more to the story. Andrew Biggs, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and former principal deputy commissioner of the Social Security Administration, explains it this way: Budget experts use two main measures of the budget deficit: the "on-budget" balance, which includes everything except Social Security and the postal service, and the "unified budget," which merges the on- and off-budgets. The unified budget approach is by far the most common for budget experts and the media -- and when the Obama White House talks about a 2013 budget deficit of $901 billion, it's the unified budget deficit that's being cited. On a unified budget basis, when Social Security's financial position worsens, the budget deficit grows. Social Security contributes about $53 billion to the budget deficit. But let’s go a little deeper, relying on experts such as the Tax Policy Center’s Howard Gleckman and the work of our PolitiFact colleagues and the Washington Post Fact Checker. Social Security’s red ink Although Social Security used to run surpluses, over the past few years it hasn’t collected enough in taxes to pay in benefits. And the trust fund consists not of prior Social Security surplus funds, but of interest-bearing securities provided through federal government borrowing -- thus the link to the deficit. Social Security is a pay-as-you-go system: Payroll taxes paid by current workers and their employers go to pay benefits to current retirees and other Social Security recipients. From 1984 to 2009, Social Security collected more money in payroll taxes than it paid out in benefits. That surplus was transferred from the Social Security program to the federal government's general fund. In return, the Treasury gave Social Security bonds that it could redeem to pay future benefits. The government, in turn, incurred obligations to repay the bonds, plus interest, to the Social Security trust fund. Since 2010, Social Security has been paying more in benefits than it has collected in payroll taxes. To meet its payments, Social Security began redeeming the bonds, plus interest, from the federal government. In other words, money was transferred from the government’s general fund to Social Security. That has an impact on the government’s deficit because the Treasury has had to borrow money in order to make such a transfer. Pocan noted that in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2012, Social Security had a $36 billion surplus. But he ignores the fact that Social Security had to tap its trust fund. A closer look shows that Social Security actually had a cash flow deficit and used roughly $110 billion in interest to help make benefit payments. Because the government had to borrow money in order to pay the interest to Social Security; that contributes to the federal deficit. Indeed, White House figures show the Social Security shortfalls contributing to the overall federal deficit. And Obama has acknowledged that Social Security adds to -- though isn’t the primary driver of -- the deficit. Our rating Pocan is not the first to claim that Social Security does not contribute to the federal government’s budget deficit. Nor even the most recent. Two days after Pocan made his statement, Baldwin said on C-SPAN: "Social Security has not contributed one penny to our current deficit or debt." But unlike Pocan, she noted the government has used "other taxpayer funds" when payroll taxes weren’t enough to pay Social Security benefits. In 2011, 2012 and 2013, our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas, Georgia and New Hampshire examined claims similar to Pocan’s. Each reached the same rating: Mostly False. And that’s what we rate Pocan’s statement.	None	Mark Pocan	None	None	None	2013-04-26T09:00:00	2013-04-16	['None']
pomt-06172	"President Obama has increased the federal workforce 192,000 individuals -- about 10 percent since he’s taken office -- while we’ve lost 2 million jobs."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/dec/15/ron-johnson/sen-ron-johnson-says-obama-has-increased-federal-w/	Continuing a trend that began under President George W. Bush after 9/11, the federal government workforce has grown under President Barack Obama, mostly in defense, homeland security and related agencies. Wisconsin’s junior senator, Republican Ron Johnson, wants to roll back the Obama-era growth by 2015 by not filling positions as people leave or retire. He says it could save $248 billion over a decade. That proposal is part of a $1.4 trillion deficit-cutting plan Johnson presented to the congressional "supercommittee" that haggled over a budget-balancing plan before it reached a stalemate. In the wake of the failure, Johnson argued it shouldn’t be that hard to find savings, especially in the federal worker ranks. "I’m not talking about firing or terminating anybody, but we’ve got about 400,000 workers ready to retire," Johnson said in a Nov. 17, 2011 appearance on Bloomberg television. He added: "President Obama has increased the federal workforce 192,000 individuals, about 10 percent since he’s taken office, while we’ve lost 2 million jobs." Were Johnson’s numbers on target? PolitiFact National has tested many jobs claims. Its gold standard for official jobs figures is the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, considered the official arbiter of U.S. employment numbers. Checking those numbers, we found that it’s accurate that 2 million jobs were lost in the overall private and public sectors (local and state governments dropped considerably). We used a baseline of January 2009, the last partial month of President George W. Bush. What about the federal workforce? Using the same Bureau of Labor Statistics figures, we found a smaller jump in the federal workforce than Johnson claimed -- a 129,900 gain, or 6 percent -- from January 2009 to October 2011. That’s based on preliminary numbers posted as of late November. Where did Johnson get his 192,000 jobs and 10 percent increase? He pointed us to the official executive-branch jobs data kept on the FedScope website by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. The June 2011 FedScope data on civilian jobs -- the latest available when Johnson spoke -- showed 2.137 million federal employees, excluding most of the judicial, legislative and postal jobs. Johnson provided us data for December 2008 -- just before Obama took office -- that he said he obtained privately from the agency. It showed 1.945 million federal jobs. The agency declined to comment on Johnson’s data. An OPM official said the agency did not publicly put out FedScope data for that month. The agency referred us to publicly available September 2008 data, a few months prior, which showed 1.938 million federal jobs. Either starting point gets you to Johnson’s 10 percent increase, about 190,000 jobs added. Another important note: On the federal government growth, most of the increase goes away if you include the U.S. Postal Service, which has shrunk significantly. When you do, the increase is 29,000. PolitiFact has found that both presentations -- postal workers in, postal workers out -- are used and credible. But they measure different things. Some researchers see the quasi-governmental Postal Service as separate; others say it’s still part of the federal government. "If you ignore that fact and say ‘The federal government is growing strongly’ and leave unsaid ‘except the parts that are shrinking fast,’ aren’t you just misleading readers?" asked Gary Burtless, senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. What about Johnson’s data source, FedScope? FedScope is considered reliable and is used by researchers who prefer an actual headcount to the sample-based approach used by BLS. So Johnson is in good company when citing FedScope, which his office views as more precise than the BLS for the federal workforce. Johnson, though, mixes his data sources, and there are other problems with his numbers. If he had stuck with BLS for both numbers, he would gotten a significantly smaller increase in federal jobs -- 6 percent instead of the 10 percent he cited. Plus, the FedScope numbers are not adjusted for seasonal swings, while the BLS data is tweaked for that. It’s impossible to judge the impact of that, but the difference might be notable, based on our review of BLS seasonal and non-seasonal data. In addition, Johnson’s time frame is off in a couple ways. His start date of December 2008 is about a month shy of Bush’s final month. So his figures wrongly attribute a small chunk of federal government growth to Obama. And while his data was the latest available on FedScope, it was not as current as BLS. Our conclusion Despite all that, we found, it’s clear Johnson is on target on the 2 million jobs lost overall, and accurate or very close on the federal workforce trend -- at least using FedScope. But juxtaposing the two numbers invites an apples to oranges comparison because they are from two different data sources. FedScope is credible, but a different animal than the BLS figures, so a lot of clarification of differences is needed to explain the relationship between the two measurements. If Johnson had used the more up-to-date and widely quoted Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers for both calculations, the federal growth trend would have been less dramatic, though still significant. Finally, we’ll note that PolitiFact routinely checks not only the accuracy of jobs numbers, but whether blame or credit is justifiably fixed on the subject of the political claim. For job-creation and job-loss claims, we have noted in the past that politicians’ policies are just one factor in employment levels. That’s true in this case, though the first part of Johnson’s claim -- on federal government growth -- arguably relates in large part to policy decisions by Obama. Bottom line: A generally accurate statement that leaves out some key details. That fits our definition of Half True.	None	Ron Johnson	None	None	None	2011-12-15T09:00:00	2011-12-15	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-12123	Wages "haven’t gone up for a long time."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/aug/17/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-wages-havent-gone-long-time-s-wr/	It was hardly the most widely noticed remark in his Trump Tower lobby question-and-answer session on Aug. 15 -- that would be his comments on the unrest in Charlottesville, Va. But one economic assertion by President Donald Trump caught our attention. As Trump was leaving, a reporter asked him what he thought "needs to be done to overcome the racial divides in this country?" "I really think jobs can have a big impact," Trump said, going on to tout investments by car companies and iPhone manufacturer Foxconn. "I think if we continue to create jobs at levels that I’m creating jobs, I think that’s going to have a tremendous impact, positive impact, on race relations." The reporter then pressed him on how an improved economy would ease race relations. "Because the people are going to be working," Trump said. "They’re going to be making a lot of money, much more than they ever thought possible. That’s going to happen. The other thing, very important: I believe wages will start going up. They haven’t gone up for a long time." Is Trump correct that wages "haven’t gone up for a long time?" Short answer: No. They’re going up now, in fact. While it’s true that wages were stagnant for several years -- especially after the Great Recession -- they have been on an upward swing since early 2014. We put together the following chart showing median, inflation-adjusted weekly earnings for wage and salaried workers, 16 years of age and older, going back to 1979: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com It shows that for much of the time between 2012 and 2014, median weekly earnings were lower than they were in 1979 -- a frustrating disappearance of any wage growth for 35 years. But that began changing in 2014. After hitting a low of $330 a week in early 2014, wages have risen to $354 a week by early 2017. That’s an increase of 7.3 percent over a roughly three-year period. "In this case, you can say the president is flatly wrong," said Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless. "Real wages have been rising more slowly than anyone wishes, except perhaps employers. Nonetheless, they have been rising." Burtless noted that the increases for a subset of all workers -- "production and non-supervisory employees" -- have been occurring for even longer. They’ve gone up every month but two since late 2012. Jed Kolko, the chief economist with the jobs site Indeed.com, added that "not only have wages gone up overall, but wages are now increasing most for people with less education. So, wage gains aren't being driven only by top earners." He provided this chart, showing that non-college full-time employees have been growing by 3 percent to 4 percent a year. The White House did not respond to an inquiry. Our ruling Trump said that wages "haven’t gone up for a long time." That was once accurate, but it’s significantly out of date. Wages have been increasing for the past three to five years, depending on the measurement you use. We rate the statement False.

pomt-15380	"By one leading measure, what business owners pay out in wages and salaries is now finally growing faster than what they spend on health insurance" for the first time in 17 years.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/30/barack-obama/are-wages-finally-growing-faster-health-insurance-/	Even if you’re not a direct beneficiary of Obamacare, you’ve reaped its benefits, said President Barack Obama in response to the Supreme Court’s ruling upholding elements of the Affordable Care Act. "By one leading measure, what business owners pay out in wages and salaries is now finally growing faster than what they spend on health insurance. That hasn't happened in 17 years," he said on June 25. Obama’s point is that employers have been spending more and more on health care, so they couldn’t increase wages. Now, he says, health care costs are reined in, which means workers can get more in their paychecks. We wanted to know if Obama was right that this was the first time this has happened since 1998. The White House told us Obama got his numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Employment Cost Index, which measures changes in employee compensation over time. The data shows that, in the past 17 years, wages grew faster than health care in just one 12-month period, and it was recently: from March 2014 to March 2015. Health care costs grew by 2.5 percent, compared to a 2.6 percent rise in wages. Obama’s claim was specific in looking at the growth in employer health care costs from year to year. Other measures have found similar trends when looking at changes over longer periods of times and employee share of the insurance tab. Bloomberg, for example, bookended a 25-year period and found that health costs for business almost quadrupled from 1987 to 2012, while wages doubled. According to a report from the health care think tank the Commonwealth Fund, between 2003 and 2013, average family premiums jumped 73 percent, while median family income increased by 16 percent. While Obama’s numbers are accurate, experts had a few words of caution. First, it’s too early to tell how big of a role Obamacare played in curbing health care costs. Beyond legislation, experts also count the recession and a slowdown in medical advancements as potential reasons. "I don't think people know the exact relationship between health care costs and Obamacare," said Janet Currie, a professor of labor and health economics at Princeton University. "I think (the claim) is true now. Whether it'll be true next quarter is another matter." Second, because wages and health benefits are typically a zero-sum game, Obama’s purported impact on paychecks could go both ways. "Because of the (law’s) increasing binding tax or penalty on the ‘Cadillac’ insurance plans, some employers may scale back on the generosity of plans and shift compensation towards wages," said Jeffrey Clemens, a professor of health economics at the University of California San Diego. Small firms may be pushed the other way, he said: "If their insurance packages fall short, firms in that position would need to increase benefits and maybe take from wages." Third, less expensive health care isn’t necessarily something to cheer about. It could reflect more bang for your buck and a more efficient system, but if the price reflects the quality of care or access to it, cheaper doesn’t mean better, said Clemens. Our ruling Obama said, "by one leading measure, what business owners pay out in wages and salaries is now finally growing faster than what they spend on health insurance" for the first time in 17 years, and he credited the Affordable Care Act. His claim is backed by numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that compare change in costs over a 12-month period: Wages grew faster than health care costs for the first time since 1998 between March 2014 and March 2015. Experts say Obama used the BLS data accurately and reasonably. They did caution that the law's role in this dynamic is still uncertain, and more data may show different results.

pomt-10240	Joe Biden "voted against the first Gulf War. He opposed the surge. He wanted to partition Iraq."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/01/lindsey-graham/only-as-a-last-resort/	John McCain's campaign readily acknowledges Joe Biden's expertise in national security matters. But that isn't stopping McCain surrogates from questioning the Democratic vice presidential nominee's judgment, especially when it comes to Iraq policy. McCain ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., raised the issue in an Aug. 31, 2008, interview on ABC News' This Week, implying that Biden lacked the backbone to stand up to powerful foes or to fix broken governments. "He has national security experience. But experience and judgment need to come together. He voted against the first Gulf War. He opposed the surge. He wanted to partition Iraq," Graham said in response to a statement about Biden's national security experience. As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Biden indeed opposed the troop buildup and called for separating Iraq into three autonomous provinces — Shiite, Sunni and Kurd. We've previously checked his Iraq policy in this story and in this ruling. But what of his opposition to the first Gulf War? It turns out Biden, with the majority of Senate Democrats, did oppose a 1991 congressional resolution authorizing the use of force following Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. The question of whether to commit troops was the first decision the 102nd Congress faced upon convening in January 1991. In spite of diplomatic initiatives that followed Iraq's invasion, the elements of a major war were in place by Jan. 1: nearly 1-million troops poised along either side of Kuwait's border with Saudi Arabia; the U.N. authorization for member nations to "use any means necessary" to secure Iraq's removal after Jan. 15; and Hussein's unwavering position that he would hold on to his conquest. Congress was put in the position of making a firm and formal stand. Democratic leaders spurned President George H.W. Bush's request for an open-ended vote of support and urged members to delay any action on the crisis, lest it undermine a final attempt at a diplomatic solution. Nonetheless, the Senate began debate on Jan. 4. On Jan. 12, a sharply divided Congress authorized the president to go to war — the first time since World War II that Congress directly confronted the issue of sending large numbers of American troops into combat. The joint resolution authorized the president "to use United States Armed Forces" to enforce a Nov. 29, 1990, U.N. Security Council ultimatum that Iraq withdraw troops from Kuwait. The resolution put no time limit on the use of American force if Iraq failed to live up to the U.N.-imposed conditions. The Senate voted 52-47 to authorize the use of force, with Biden among those voting no. Ten Democrats joined with virtually unanimous Republicans in support of the resolution. Minutes later, the House approved identical legislation by a vote of 250-183. Most of the Democratic opponents argued that war should be only a last resort, and insisted that the administration and its allies should have waited months — and maybe as long as a year — on the expectation that the pressure from economic sanctions would eventually force Iraq to withdraw. That view was endorsed by some scholars and former Pentagon officials who had testified before congressional committees, but was emphatically disputed by others. As the vote approached, Biden expressed concern about the United States bearing an undue burden of the military operations, and derided other nations in the anti-Iraq coalition, calling it, "a coalition that has allowed us to take on 95 percent of the sacrifice across the board." The vote represented the thinnest congressional margin backing military action since the War of 1812. And senators split the same way on a resolution offered prior to the use of force measure by Majority Leader George J. Mitchell of Maine and Armed Services Committee chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., that demanded a continued reliance on economic sanctions. That resolution was defeated 46-53, with Biden voting in favor. On the campaign trail, Biden makes the case that he has the requisite toughness to go head-to-head with foreign leaders. As an example, he points to a 1993 encounter with Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic duiring the Balkan wars in which he called Milosevic a war criminal to his face. But Biden's two votes on the eve of war in 1991 clearly show he favored continued economic sanctions over the use of military force. For this reason, we rule Graham's statement True.

pomt-07004	"China owns more of our bonds than do Americans."	false	/virginia/statements/2011/jul/08/george-allen/allen-says-china-owns-more-us-bonds-americans/	Republican Senate candidate George Allen said recently that the U.S. is indebted to China, and not in a good way. "China owns more of our bonds than do Americans," Allen said in a July 2 interview with the NBC 29 television station in Charlottesville. "That’s not a good position to be in." Are China’s holdings of U.S. government debt larger than the amount Americans own? We checked to see if that was true. The national debt stands at $14.3 trillion. Nearly $6 trillion of that is held by the Federal Reserve and U.S. government agencies in various funds such as the Social Security Trust Fund. The rest of the amount, about $8.3 trillion, is "privately-held" debt owed to mutual funds, pension funds, foreign investors and other bond holders. There’s no doubt China holds a lot of U.S. government debt. In fact, it’s the largest foreign owner of U.S. Treasury securities. As of March 2011, China owned about $1.2 trillion of U.S. debt - more than a quarter of the total $4.5 trillion in U.S. treasuries held by foreign investors, according to statistics from the U.S. Treasury Department. But the rest of the roughly $3.8 trillion of privately held debt was owned by United States investors such as banks, pension funds and mutual funds. So there’s no way that China owns more U.S. debt than domestic investors. But Bill Riggs, an Allen campaign spokesman, told us that when the former governor said China held more bonds than Americans, he was referring to debt held by ordinary American investors. To support that narrower contention, the Allen campaign sent us a couple of reports from the U.S. Treasury to argue that regular American investors’ U.S. debt holdings were less than China’s. Allen’s campaign pointed to an April 2011 Treasury report showing the June 2010 amount of foreign holdings of U.S. securities, which includes treasury securities as well as other investments including stocks and debt owed by U.S. agencies.According to the report, China had $1.6 trillion of U.S. securities. Riggs then sent us a Treasury Department table showing the breakdown of how much U.S. Treasuries are held by various classes of investors. That chart breaks out holders of U.S. treasuries into about 10 groups such as U.S. banks, savings bonds, pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds, foreign investors, state and local governments and a miscellaneous "other investors" category. Riggs said the campaign tallied up the total debt held by what Allen termed American investors. Allen’s campaign included debt tied up in U.S.savings bonds, private pension funds, state and local government pensions and mutual funds. Investors in those funds held a total of $1.5 trillion of debt in June 2010, Riggs said. The Allen campaign did not include in its calculations U.S. Treasury debt held by banks, insurance companies, state and local governments outside their pension funds or tallies from the "other investors" category. That $1.5 trillion tally that Allen attributes to American investors is less than the $1.6 trillion attributed to China in Treasury’s April report. But there are serious flaws with the Allen campaign’s reasoning. First of all, Allen’s rationale is an apples-to-oranges comparison. The smaller $1.5 trillion tally for so-called American investors only includes U.S. Treasury securities. But the larger $1.6 trillion tally linked to China includes not just Treasury debt, but other investments a well -- such as stocks and corporate debt. Derek Scissors, an economist who specializes in Asian affairs at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said the two numbers are not measuring the same thing. "It’s not a comparable number," Scissors said. "They’re trying to build a skewed case." Scissors was also skeptical of how the Allen campaign defined debt held by regular American investors. If the Allen campaign was going to count debt held by mutual funds, Scissors wondered why they didn’t include debts held by U.S. banks. Scissors also said some portion of the "other investors" category, which held $1.2 trillion of U.S. treasury debt in June 2010, would certainly include some debt owned by Americans. But Allen’s calculations for American-held debt doesn’t count a penny of debt held in that category, which includes debt held by individuals, government-sponsored enterprise and businesses. For the record, we checked a pair of Treasury Department charts to get the latest official tally of how much U.S. treasury securities were owned by China. As of December 2010 -- the most recent month for which we could find comparable data -- mainland China and Hong Kong (which are reported separately) together held nearly $1.3 trillion in U.S. Treasury securities. In that same month, the investor categories comprising Allen’s definition of regular investors held $1.6 trillion in U.S. securities. To sum up: Allen said China owns more U.S. bonds than Americans. That statement is wrong on its face, but the Allen campaign offers a qualifier -- his spokesman said Allen’s statement is a reference to regular American investors. But the reports Allen cites are not comparable and don’t even prove that narrower assertion. Official debt tallies, even using Allen’s definition of ordinary American investors, show U.S. citizens held more government debt than China. As an added defense, Allen’s campaign said Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke in February testified before Congress that he thinks China owns more than $2 trillion of U.S. government bonds. That still doesn’t prove Allen’s point. The bottom line is that Allen’s methodology of including some U.S. investors and ignoring others is highly questionable, and his evidence doesn’t add up to his conclusion. We rate the claim False.

pomt-04218	"In the past year alone, Ohio businesses have created more jobs than almost every other state in the country."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/nov/29/jobs-ohio/jobs-ohio-claims-buckeye-state-nearly-tops-new-job/	The nasty political ads have been gone for weeks, but the launch of a marketing campaign aimed at trumpeting Ohio’s improving economy offers a preview of the next great election battle. JobsOhio, the state’s private economic development agency, is on air with a 30-second commercial that celebrates workers of all stripes and conveys an optimistic message. The agency is the brainchild of Republican Gov. John Kasich, who has ridden Ohio’s rising fortunes to rising poll numbers. And the "Thrive in Ohio" spot, which also asks viewers to share their success stories on a web site, has rankled Democrats hoping to unseat Kasich in 2014. Never mind that the spot doesn’t feature Kasich or identify him or the governor’s office in any way. Democrats see a calculated political move bankrolled by state development money. The push also includes print advertising and will cost $1.4 million, the Columbus Dispatch reported. Cuyahoga County Executive Ed FitzGerald, one potential challenger to Kasich, has publicly called on Kasich to suspend the campaign, declaring it a waste of taxpayer dollars. Given the dust-up surrounding the JobsOhio blitz and the role the state’s economy is sure to play in the gubernatorial race, PolitiFact Ohio decided to evaluate the claim central to the TV spot. "In the past year alone, Ohio businesses have created more jobs than almost every other state in the country," an unseen narrator says, his words scored to an inspirational piano melody. "And it’s only the beginning." So how does the statement stack up when peeled away from such slick marketing? Laura Jones, communications director for JobsOhio, cited employment data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Via email, Jones said the numbers showed that from October 2011 through October 2012, only California, Texas and New York created more jobs than Ohio. Jones referred us to the bureau’s Regional and State Employment and Unemployment report. According to seasonally adjusted employment numbers in October, 30 states reported statistically significant increases in employment year-over-year -- Ohio among them. Table E, found on page seven of the 21-page report, breaks down the employment trends by state. Since October 2011, according to preliminary data, Ohio has added 96,500 jobs. Indeed, that increase ranks fourth, behind the more-populated California, Texas and New York. Because the report was dated Nov. 20, three days after JobsOhio posted the commercial to YouTube, PolitiFact Ohio went back to look at the previous month’s report, which evaluated the period from September 2011 and September 2012. We found the Buckeye State in the same position: fourth among states with statistically significant employment increases. We also checked with George Zeller, an economic research analyst from Cleveland. He was familiar with the Thrive in Ohio campaign and, after paging through the BLS reports agreed that the numbers cited by JobsOhio were legitimate. But what do the numbers prove? "What they’re saying there is that Ohio’s No. 4," Zeller said. "What you have to recognize is that of course we’re going to gain more jobs than Vermont, because Vermont is smaller. There are 50 states, so being fourth is higher than others. But we’re by no means at the top." Zeller makes a valid point. Ohio, by virtue of being one of the nation’s most populous states, is destined to have and add more jobs than smaller states. Ohio is the seventh-most populous state, according to Census figures, ranking behind California, Texas, New York, Florida, Illinois and Pennsylvania. In terms of jobs added, Ohio is up there with other highly populated states. Zeller also noted that Ohio’s recovery, while real, is coming slowly. At current pace, said Zeller, citing his research, it will take the state 11 years to recover all jobs lost during the recession. "There’s nothing untrue about what [JobsOhio] said," Zeller continued via telephone. "Now does that mean that we are outstripping the rest of the country? No. First of all, because we lost more jobs than the rest of the country did … we have to do a lot more to make them up." Of course Democrats will come armed with other numbers as the gubernatorial fight nears. They often cite BLS data that show the state’s unemployment rate began dropping in early 2010, under Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland and and Democratic President Barack Obama. To their point, it’s worth noting that public policy set outside Ohio affects the state’s economy. Exhibit A: The federal government’s bailout of the U.S. auto industry, a huge Ohio employer. As such, Democrats argue that Ohio was en route to economic recovery months before Kasich defeated Strickland in the November 2010 election. Ironically, Kasich’s constant ballyhooing of these improved prospects was at odds with the message pushed by Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and might have helped Obama’s re-election bid this year. Now that the race for the White House in the rearview mirror, it is no surprise that Democrats see the JobsOhio commercial as the unofficial kickoff of Kasich’s re-election campaign. Perhaps that makes this the unofficial kickoff of PolitiFact Ohio’s monitoring of the contest, whether it’s FitzGerald, Strickland or another candidate who takes on the incumbent governor in 2014. For its Thrive in Ohio campaign, JobsOhio said businesses here "have created more jobs than almost every other state in the country" over the last year. A second later, the ad’s narrator added: "And it’s only the beginning." That qualifier is appropriate given the perspective Zeller supplied. Considering Ohio’s size, a statement about the state’s comparatively high level of job creation is not the ultimate benchmark of success. JobsOhio seems to realize this. On the Truth-O-Meter, the agency’s statement rates True.	None	Jobs Ohio	None	None	None	2012-11-29T06:00:00	2012-11-17	['Ohio']

pomt-11287	Says Jacky Rosen promised "to repeal middle-class tax cut."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/24/dean-heller/middle-class-tax-cuts-weapon-nevada-senate-race/	In his re-election bid, U.S. Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., argued that his leading Democratic opponent wants to take away tax cuts for working families. Heller’s campaign announced its latest attack on Rep. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., in a press release on tax filing day. "Heller campaign releases new digital ad on Jacky Rosen’s reckless promise to repeal middle-class tax cut," the campaign wrote on April 17. The Heller campaign ad consists mainly of broadcast clips of reporters giving examples of companies that announced bonuses and raises for workers. But it closes by saying Rosen "wants the tax bill repealed," and includes a clip of a newscaster saying "Nevada Congresswoman Jacky Rosen wants the recently passed GOP tax bill repealed." The Heller campaign said that report was about a Las Vegas event held by the advocacy group Not One Penny. The event was part of a nationwide protest against the Republican-backed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and Rosen participated. The group billed the national action as the "Repeal the Trump Tax Tour," saying the new tax law "will raise taxes for 92 million middle-class families, rip health care away from 13 million people, and threaten life-saving programs — all to give tax breaks to millionaires, billionaires, and wealthy corporations." According to the Tax Policy Center, a project of the Urban Institute and Brookings, 90 percent of middle-income households would pay less in 2018, but those savings largely disappear by 2027, except for the top 1 percent of earners. For its stop in Las Vegas on Jan. 15, 2018, the group called on Republicans to "repeal the Trump Tax on middle-class Families," as the group’s press release put it. We watched the full video of the event. Rosen left no room for doubt that she opposed the Republican tax cuts. "This tax bill at its core is a giveaway to special interests and the wealthy," Rosen said. "And it will disadvantage millions of working families in the long run. In 10 years, by 2027, more than half of all Americans will pay more in their tax bill." Rosen said the bill was "out of balance," but stopped short of calling for full repeal. "We must come together to use common sense to fix this reckless tax bill and protect our families against long-term damage," Rosen said. While the news report quoted in the Heller ad said she called for repeal, Rosen herself didn’t say that. A search of the Nexis news database and of Rosen’s Twitter accounts reveals no mention. Nor could the Heller campaign provide any examples. Heller campaign spokesman Keith Schipper said, "Rosen never made it a point to say she just wanted to change part of it and keep other parts." In a March 27 op-ed, Rosen said she supports middle-class tax cuts and chastised Heller. "If Sen. Heller and Republicans had really wanted to give a tax cut to working families, why not give them a bigger, permanent tax cut directly instead of relying on trickle-down economics?" she wrote. Our ruling Heller said that Rosen promised to repeal middle-class tax cuts. The Republican tax law provides immediate tax relief to middle-class families, though those savings expire without further action for all but the highest earners. Rosen spoke at an event that called for repeal of what they called the "Trump Tax" on the middle class. However, Rosen said the law should be fixed; she did not say it should be repealed. As a point of policy, both Rosen and the organizers of the event where she spoke support middle-class tax cuts, but not the package passed by Republicans. There’s some nuance here, but Rosen didn’t vow to repeal the current tax law. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-01018	"Common welfare programs give income of $43,330 or $20.83 an hour."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2015/feb/01/rhode-island-center-freedom-and-prosperity/do-common-welfare-programs-pay-equivalent-2083-hou/	Rhode Island's minimum wage just rose to $9 an hour. There's a push by Democrats to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10. That’s chump change if you believe a Jan. 10 tweet by the Rhode Island Center for Freedom and Prosperity. It said you can earn the equivalent of $20.83 an hour by not working and being on welfare. The conservative think tank reported: "RI should make working more attractive than welfare! Common welfare programs give income of $43,330 or $20.83 an hour." That struck us as very attractive. We wondered if it were true. First we asked the center's CEO, Mike Stenhouse, if there were any important caveats omitted from the tweet, which is restricted to 140 characters. With more characters available, he said in an email, the statement would have been something like: "Estimating the combined value of certain public assistance programs available in Rhode Island, common welfare programs can give recipients a pretax income equivalent of up to $43,330 or $20.83 an hour." Neglecting to say "up to" and "equivalent to" are important omissions. So the $43,330 represents the maximum value of the benefits, not actual cash income that recipients can spend as they wish. The source for the claim, said Stenhouse, is a report from the libertarian Cato Institute called "The Work Versus Welfare Trade-Off: 2013." It examined the value of various welfare programs by state. The Rhode Island total comes from starting with the $6,648 a year in cash welfare that a single parent with two children could receive, which is the only unrestricted cash that recipients would see. (It's also 34 percent less than what recipients got in 1995, adjusted for inflation, according to Cato.) Then you add in $6,249 per year in food stamps (now called the SNAP program), $12,702 in housing subsidies, $11,302 as the cost of buying health care coverage comparable to Medicaid, $275 in heating assistance, $300 a year under the Emergency Food Assistance program (TEFAP), and $1,156 in food under the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program for pregnant women, new mothers and children up to age 5. The total -- $38,632 -- is equivalent to what a single parent with two children would get to keep after taxes if the parent earned $43,330 a year, or $20.83 an hour for a 40-hour work week, Cato said. "Many welfare recipients, even those receiving the highest level of benefits, are doing everything they can to find employment and leave the welfare system," the Cato report concludes. "Still, it is undeniable that for many recipients -- especially long-term dependents -- welfare pays more than the type of entry-level job that a typical welfare recipient can expect to find. As long as this is true, many recipients are likely to choose welfare over work." But there's a problem: There's nothing typical about this amount because very few poor people are eligible for -- or take advantage of -- all these programs. The Cato report acknowledges that most people won't be getting close to the $38,632. For example, welfare recipients aren't eligible for WIC benefits unless they have children under age 5. Another example: Many poor people can't get a housing subsidy -- only 1 in 4 Rhode Islanders receiving cash welfare are also receiving housing assistance. Anticipating such criticism, Cato did another calculation, looking only at the welfare, food stamp and Medicaid programs that, they said, nearly all poor people would be eligible for. Cato found that the value of just those benefits was equivalent to being paid $17,347 a year, or $8.34 an hour. That's a far cry from $20.83 an hour. On the other hand, $8.34 an hour is still only 66 cents below the current Rhode Island minimum wage, with no need to punch a time clock, find child care, or arrange for transportation to and from a job. It's not clear how many welfare recipients are actually enrolled in the food stamp and Medicaid programs. Cato, the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the Economic Progress Institute, a liberal think tank at Rhode Island College that studies poverty and other economic issues, didn't have that number. Finally, the Rhode Island Center for Freedom and Prosperity uses the value of the benefits to argue that the state "should make working more attractive than welfare." But Linda Katz, policy director of the Economic Progress Institute, argued there's already a huge incentive to working instead of being on welfare. She said a family of three, with the parent earning $13 per hour, can still receive food stamps, heating assistance, housing assistance and other benefits that Cato values at $28,000. "Instead of having $6,000 in your welfare check, you have $27,000 in your paycheck. And you still keep everything else," she said. That's not true, said Justin Katz (no relation), the Center for Freedom and Prosperity’s research director. The food stamp allotment, for example, would be cut dramatically for someone making $13 an hour full time. We confirmed that with the state's SNAP administrator. A single mother at that pay level would not even be eligible for food stamps unless other expenses were taken into account. With monthly bills of $1,000 in rent, $60 in utility costs, and a friend or relative caring for the children, that mother would get about $2,000 in food stamps per year, far less than the $6,000 she would get if she has no income. The same with a housing subsidy. A single mother in Providence making $13 an hour would potentially be paying $8,112 a year for subsidized housing (if she could get it). That same mother with no income would have to pay just $600 a year for that apartment, according to Michael V. Milito, deputy assistant director of Rhode Island Housing. In a subsequent email, Linda Katz acknowledged that she had erred. Our ruling The Rhode Island Center for Freedom and Prosperity tweeted that "Common welfare programs give income of $43,330 or $20.83 an hour." It's not income as most people think of it. It's how much a poor single parent with two children under age 5 would have to earn to get the equivalent value of all programs, including food stamps, medical care, heating assistance and housing subsidies, plus $6,648 a year in cash assistance. But that's a hypothetical maximum that only a small fraction of welfare recipients reach because they're not eligible for those specific benefits, they didn't apply for them, or a benefit is not available. The Center’s tweet suggests the scenario is more common than it is. It could have added the caveats and still stayed within Twitter’s 140-character limit. For example: "RI should make working more attractive than welfare! Common welfare programs give income up to $43,330 or $20.83/hr for single parent of 2." Because the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-15031	"HIV/AIDS among women is skyrocketing in Austin."	false	/texas/statements/2015/oct/02/ora-houston/ora-houston-incorrectly-says-hivaids-skyrocketing-/	Public health’s focus on HIV/AIDS typically tilts toward men. That’s because men who have sex with men still face the greatest risk of getting the disease and represent most new cases. But out of the spotlight, how are women faring? "HIV/AIDS among women is skyrocketing in Austin," Austin City Council Member Ora Houston told council colleagues Sept. 8, 2015, "and we need to do some specific targeting for that." Houston, who represents District 1, sought an additional $150,000 in spending in the 2015-16 budget year for the Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department’s HIV/AIDS initiatives. Houston’s ask was made in the context of bolstering efforts aimed at improving the quality of life of African-Americans in Austin, an initiative the city launched several years ago. The proposal didn’t win council approval, although the department drew a 16-percent surge in its overall budget. Also, it turns out, Houston wasn’t right about HIV and AIDS among Austin women "skyrocketing." Yet for decades and across the nation, African-Americans have been the racial group hardest hit--with black women the most disproportionately affected. It’s a wide gap that similarly persists in Travis County. Houston says she misspoke Houston, asked how she reached her "skyrocketing" declaration, told us by phone she misspoke. "The larger issue is what do we do to save the women in my community infected with HIV/AIDS," she said. Some background: In Travis County, fewer than one in 10 residents is black, but more than one in five of the 4,401 residents living with HIV at the end of 2014 was black, according to health department data. Also that year, nearly 711 in every 100,000 black females living in the county, or 318 individuals, had the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS. That was double the number of Hispanic females (156) and nearly triple the number of white females (109) living with HIV. From another vantage point, the rate of black females living with HIV in Travis County was over 17 times higher than the rate for white females and nearly nine times higher than the rate for Hispanic females. There were still many more men, of all races, with HIV. The rate of black males living in the county with HIV was 1,589.4 per 100,000 in 2014, reflecting 670 individuals. The rates were 634.9 for white males (1,743 people) and 617.8 for Hispanic males (1,235 individuals). Put another way, the rate of black males living with HIV/AIDS in Travis County was 2.5 times higher than the rate for white or Hispanic males. A national pattern The disparity in rates of African American women getting infected with HIV or diagnosed with AIDS, which has deepened since the epidemic began, is rooted in a variety of factors, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office on Women’s Health. A key factor is poverty, which is more widespread in the African-American community and can result in less access to care and, often, a failure to know one’s HIV status. Also, the office says, because African-Americans tend to have sex with partners of the same race, and because the disease is higher in that population, their risk of getting HIV is greater. "Stigma, fear, discrimination, homophobia and negative perceptions about HIV testing can also place too many African-American women at higher risk," the Office on Women’s Health says. "Many at risk for infection fear stigma more than infection. They may choose instead to hide their high-risk behavior rather than get counseling and testing." No skyrocket among Travis County women In Travis County, annual diagnoses of HIV and AIDS for women mostly declined from 2005 through 2014, health department figures show. Most recently, 4 in 100,000 female residents in the county were newly diagnosed with HIV in 2014 compared to an average 6.1 incidence rate from 2005 through 2013. The AIDS incidence rate for all women in the county was 1.9 per 100,000 women in 2014 compared to an average 4.3 rate from 2005 through 2013. Women of all races represented a small number of Travis County residents diagnosed with HIV in 2014: just 23 of the 244 cases. Also in 2014, 98 Travis County residents, including 11 females, were diagnosed with full-blown AIDS. We did not learn how many black females fell into these categories. Health department staff epidemiologist Jeff Taylor advised us by phone that because very few women are diagnosed with HIV/AIDS each year, the department doesn't publicly release raw numbers based on by race and ethnicity. "Some of those numbers may be one, two, three or four, and people get concerned about confidentiality," Taylor said. We were, however, able to compare rates among racial and ethnic groups for a decade. Each year, from 2005 through 2014, the rates of HIV and AIDS among African-American males and females in Travis County was higher than the rates among Hispanics and whites. The far higher rates in black females, when compared to Hispanic and white females, are "startling," Shannon Jones III, director of the city/county health department, said at a recent conference on health disparities. Then again, the data show a 27 percent drop in new HIV diagnoses for black females between 2013 and 2014, though there was an increase in AIDS diagnoses; the incidence of 16 black females per 100,000 black women was up from 12.3 in 2013. Between 2013 and 2014, HIV rates also fell for white females but ticked up among Hispanic females from 3.2 per 100,000 in 2013 to 3.7 per 100,000 in 2014. New diagnoses of HIV are the best barometer of how the disease is trending in a community, Taylor said. Between 2005 and 2014, the rate of new HIV infections for black females in the county ranged from a high of 42.9 per 100,000 black women in 2006 to a low of 19.4 in 2011. Our ruling Houston said HIV/AIDS among women is skyrocketing in Austin. That’s not so. While black women have persistently been diagnosed with HIV/AIDS at higher rates than other women, HIV/AIDS incidence rates for Travis County women declined for most of the past decade.

pomt-15293	President Barack Obama "said at the beginning of the negotiations that the basic approach was to dismantle Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for dismantling the sanctions."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/22/tom-cotton/was-obamas-goal-beginning-negotiations-dismantle-i/	In the wake of the newly completed Iran nuclear agreement, a number of Republicans have charged that the Obama administration has struck a deal that they see as dangerous and inadequate. Among them is freshman Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., a frequent critic of Obama’s foreign policy. In an appearance on CNN on July 15, Cotton lamented what he saw as a weak agreement: "He (Obama) said at the beginning of the negotiations that the basic approach was to dismantle Iran's nuclear program in exchange for dismantling the sanctions. In fact, we are going to keep Iran's nuclear program in place. In fact, Western countries are going to help Iran develop advanced capabilities." We decided to check the claim that the administration’s original intent was to dismantle Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for dismantling the sanctions. Which nuclear program? Since Iran has long asserted that it has a right to pursue nuclear energy -- as distinct from nuclear weapons -- a key question for us was whether the term "nuclear program" referred narrowly to nuclear weapons or more broadly to any kind of nuclear research, including nuclear energy. It’s easy to see how a speaker could say "nuclear program" when they actually intended to say "nuclear weapons program." The answer, according to Cotton’s staff, is that the senator was referring to the nuclear program as a whole, not simply the weapons program. Cotton’s staff also pointed PolitiFact to some quotes from Obama’s 2012 presidential debate against Mitt Romney to back up their claim. In the debate, Obama boasted of the success of sanctions in paving a way forward for negotiations: "The work that we’ve done with respect to sanctions now offers Iran a choice. They can take the diplomatic route and end their nuclear program or they will have to face a united world and a United States president, me, who said we’re not going to take any options off the table," he said. He alluded to Iran either giving up or ending their nuclear program — he didn’t specify that he was referring to the Iranian nuclear weapons program — two more times during the debate. However, this wouldn’t have been, as Cotton said, "at the beginning of negotiations" -- the first meeting between Secretary of State John Kerry and his Iranian counterparts was held on Sept. 26, 2013. (Here's a detailed timeline.) So we decided to see if we could find some stronger evidence. As it happens, a pro-Israel group, the Israel Project, also made a statement much like Cotton’s, and a spokeswoman pointed us to several pieces of evidence. One is a remark by Kerry before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Dec. 10, 2013, right around the time negotiations were kicking into gear. "But I don’t think that any of us thought we were just imposing these sanctions for the sake of imposing them. We did it because we knew that it would hopefully help Iran dismantle its nuclear program. That was the whole point of the regime." Upon examining the full context of Kerry’s speech, however, it becomes clear that Kerry was not referring to the strategy of the White House, but rather to his own time in the Senate, and he seems to reflect the mind-set he and his fellow senators had toward sanctions. "I will tell you that in my 29 years, just about shy of the full 29 I’ve served in the Senate, I was always a leading proponent of the sanctions against Iran. I’m proud of what we did here. But it was undeniable that the pressure we put on Iran through these sanctions is exactly what has brought Iran to the table today, and I think Congress deserves an enormous amount of credit for that," said Kerry. Only then does he add, "But I don’t think that any of us thought we were just imposing these sanctions for the sake of imposing them. We did it because we knew that it would hopefully help Iran dismantle its nuclear program. That was the whole point of the regime." The Israel Project also pointed us to a comment by Wendy Sherman, the under secretary of state for political affairs, during a PBS interview on Dec. 4, 2013. Asked whether a comprehensive agreement will "include dismantling, full dismantling," Sherman replied, "This includes a lot of dismantling of their infrastructure … At the end of the day, what is critical here is that the international community and the United States of America must have full confidence that Iran truly has a peaceful program." But Sherman’s statement refers to "a lot of dismantling," which is short of a full dismantling. Contrary evidence Perhaps the most definitive refutation of Cotton’s claim comes from Obama himself, in an appearance on Dec. 7, 2013, at a Middle East policy forum -- again, right around when the negotiations were starting. "If we could create an option in which Iran eliminated every single nut and bolt of their nuclear program and forswore the possibility of ever having a nuclear program, and for that matter got rid of all its military capabilities, I would take it. But I want to make sure everybody understands it — that particular option is not available. So as a consequence, what we have to do is make a decision as to, given the options available, what is the best way for us to (ensure) Iran does not get a nuclear weapon?" This suggests that the Obama administration was focused not on completely eliminating the Iranian nuclear program, but rather on blocking the pathway to a nuclear weapon. "It has not been the goal of the George W. Bush administration or the Obama administration to completely dismantle every aspect of their nuclear program," said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, a group that aims to educate the public on arms control policy. He added, "Look at the context — (the U.S.) goal is to dismantle, curtail, reduce, to the point (Iran) cannot acquire a nuclear weapon. Nobody is arguing about completely eliminating the nuclear program." The time element of Cotton’s claim is one of its most problematic features. If Cotton had been referring to statements Obama made before he was president, he would have had a better argument, experts say. "There’s a difference between what the president has said about the nuclear program while he was in the process of trying to get elected and comments that he has made when trying to garner support in Congress and then today, when trying to explain what he has," said Richard Brennan, a political scientist at the Rand Corp. Brennan pointed us to a March 2007 speech Obama made in Chicago to the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel group. In his remarks, Obama said, "The world must work to stop Iran’s uranium enrichment program and prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons." Uranium enrichment is a key component of any nuclear program, not simply a nuclear weapons program, so this could be interpreted as Obama talking about more than simply preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. On balance, Brennan agreed with other experts we checked with that, on its face, Cotton’s statement "was probably not accurate." By the time negotiations seriously began in late 2013, the administration had changed its position to ensuring primarily that Iran did not have a nuclear weapon. Our ruling Cotton said that Obama "said at the beginning of the negotiations that the basic approach was to dismantle Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for dismantling the sanctions." In 2007 or even as late as 2012, that might have been true, though believing so requires some careful parsing of the words and intentions of Obama and his advisers. Still, by late 2013 -- the negotiation period Cotton specifically referred to -- the administration had settled on a strategy of blocking a pathway to a nuclear weapon, rather than eliminating any trace of nuclear activities in Iran, including energy. On Dec. 7, 2013, Obama himself explicitly repudiated the idea that it would be possible to fully dismantle "every single nut and bolt of their nuclear program." We rate Cotton’s statement False.

pomt-04886	Says Georgia ranks "near the bottom in per capita transportation spending."	true	/georgia/statements/2012/aug/07/stacey-abrams/does-georgia-have-pothole-transportation-spending/	The morning after the Atlanta area overwhelmingly said no to a 1 percent sales tax to fund more than 150 transportation projects across the region, one prominent leader said that her fellow state lawmakers now needed to take the lead on the issue. "Georgia has under-invested in our transportation network for years, and we rank near the bottom in per capita transportation spending," House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, an Atlanta Democrat, said in a press release. PolitiFact Georgia wondered if the state representative was correct. Or do we need to put a "stop" sign in front of Abrams before she repeats this claim again? As we began our research, PolitiFact Georgia found several officials making similar claims, including the state’s Transportation Department. "Georgia is the 6th fastest growing state in the nation, yet 49th in per capita spending on transportation," said a May 16 press release from the state agency about bridge replacements over Lake Lanier. A spokeswoman for the state’s House Democratic Caucus, which sent out Abrams’ press release, initially forwarded us a link to the Atlanta Regional Commission’s top 10 facts about the recent transportation referendum. The ARC, which works on growth and development issues for the 10-county metro area, said that Georgia was 48th in per capita spending on transportation. The ARC report did not have any charts or graphics showing how Georgia compares to other states. The caucus later sent us a report by the fiscally conservative Georgia Public Policy Foundation that said Georgia ranks 49th in per capita transportation spending. The report did not have a chart showing Georgia in comparison to the other states. We decided to do the math for ourselves as well. As part of our research, we noticed that several groups used data compiled by the Federal Highway Administration to calculate how much money each state spends on transportation. One chart we saw on its website had revenues used for highways. The most recent year was 2010. PolitiFact Georgia calculated the totals for each state and excluded federal funds since we are examining a claim about state spending on transportation. We then divided the total for each state by the number of its residents. Only two states had lower per capita highway spending, South Carolina and Tennessee. Georgia spent about $298 per person on highways. How did that compare to other reports on per capita highway spending that we reviewed? Georgia ranked similarly low. The Washington, D.C.-based Tax Policy Center found in 2009 that Georgia ranked ahead of just Rhode Island and South Carolina in per capita highway spending. The Tax Policy Center, a partnership between the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, examines federal and state tax policies and those of this year’s presidential candidates. Another report we found that examined transportation spending in Pennsylvania, based on data compiled in 2010, ranked Georgia 50th in per capita highway spending, using data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Federal Highway Administration. The report on Pennsylvania shows Georgia has more miles of highway than 40 states. Most of the states with more miles of highway also ranked low in per capita highway spending. The National Conference of State Legislatures ranked Georgia second to last in per capita revenue on highways in a report it released in 2006. The report examined highway spending from 1999 to 2004. Georgia spent about $220 per person annually, the report found. Only California was lower. Delaware was first, spending more than $900 per person, according to the research. The NCSL report also included data on spending for public transportation. Georgia ranked 38th of the 45 states that had data that could be examined. Georgia spent 55 cents per person in 2004, according to a chart in the report. Massachusetts was first, spending approximately $376 per person. Northeastern states dominated the top of the rankings and had more sources of transportation funding. We did not see any other reports on public transportation spending by state. The charts we reviewed and our own research all showed the same thing: Georgia was among the five lowest states in terms of per capita spending on highways. The most recent NCSL report on public transportation showed a similar conclusion. Therefore, we rate the statement by Abrams as True.

pomt-09690	"Barack Obama won't even use the term 'war on terrorism.'"	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/11/sean-hannity/hannity-says-obama-wont-even-use-term-war-terroris/	On Sean Hannity's Fox News show on Nov. 9, 2009, the topic was what the government knew about Fort Hood psychiatrist Nidal Malik Hasan, an Army major who authorities say killed 13 people and wounded 30 others. "There is a chance our government knew all about this guy Hasan and did nothing because nobody wanted to be called an Islamaphobe," Hannity said. "Now, this is a terrorist act," Hannity said. "What does that say about Barack Obama and our government?" "Here's the point," Hannity said, "Barack Obama won't even use the term 'war on terrorism,' because he's apologizing to America in every Muslim country he can." We've heard a number of conservative radio and talk show hosts criticize President Obama for not using the "global war on terrorism" phrase adopted by his predecessor, George W. Bush. And so we decided to check it out. We did a word search of Obama's public statements and could not find that Obama has used the phrase "war on terrorism" as president, though he said it numerous times as a candidate. And early in his presidency, Obama used the phrase "war on terror," but only a couple of times. So what gives? We found two instances where Obama directly addressed the question. The first was during a Jan. 27, 2009, interview by Hisham Melhem with al-Aribiya, an Arabic-language television news station. Melhem noted that Obama seemed to eschew Bush's phrase "war on terror" and "frame it in a different way, specifically against one group called al-Qaida and their collaborators." Obama: "I think that you're making a very important point. And that is that the language we use matters. And what we need to understand is, is that there are extremist organizations -- whether Muslim or any other faith in the past -- that will use faith as a justification for violence. We cannot paint with a broad brush a faith as a consequence of the violence that is done in that faith's name. "And so you will, I think, see our administration be very clear in distinguishing between organizations like al-Qaida -- that espouse violence, espouse terror and act on it -- and people who may disagree with my administration and certain actions, or may have a particular viewpoint in terms of how their countries should develop. We can have legitimate disagreements but still be respectful. I cannot respect terrorist organizations that would kill innocent civilians, and we will hunt them down. "But to the broader Muslim world what we are going to be offering is a hand of friendship." The issue was again raised in a Feb. 3, 2009, interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper: Cooper: "I've noticed you don't use the term 'war on terror.' I think I read an article that you've only used it once since inauguration. Is that conscious? Is there something about that term you find objectionable or not useful?" Obama: "Well, you know, I think it is very important for us to recognize that we have a battle or a war against some terrorist organizations. But that those organizations aren't representative of a broader Arab community, Muslim community. ... You know, words matter in this situation because one of the ways we're going to win this struggle is through the battle of hearts and minds." Cooper: "So that's not a term you're going to be using much in the future?" Obama: "You know, what I want to do is make sure that I'm constantly talking about al-Qaida and other affiliated organizations because we, I believe, can win over moderate Muslims to recognize that that kind of destruction and nihilism ultimately leads to a dead end, and that we should be working together to make sure that everybody has got a better life." So Obama isn't fond of the phrase "war on terror." But did that ever become blanket White House policy? According to a Washington Post story in March, a memo e-mailed to Pentagon staff members from the Defense Department's office of security review said "this administration prefers to avoid using the term 'Long War' or "Global War on Terror.' Please use 'Overseas Contingency Operation.' " According to the memo, the direction came from the White House Office of Management and Budget, which reviews speeches given by administration officials. Kenneth Baer, an OMB spokesman, told the Washington Post there was no such guidance, that it was only the opinion of "a career civil servant." Still, you don't hear administration officials using the term "war on terror," or the like, very often. Obama was criticized in some circles when he failed to even utter the words "terror" or "terrorism" in a June 4, 2009, speech in Cairo, Egypt, directed to Muslims around the world. The absence of those words "goes to the heart" of Obama's new approach, said John O. Brennan, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, who provided perhaps the clearest and most in-depth explanation of the White House lexicon in a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies on Aug. 6, 2009. "As many have noted, the president does not describe this as a 'war on terrorism.' ... Instead, as the president has made clear, we are at war with al-Qaida, which attacked us on 9/11 and killed 3,000 people. We are at war with its violent extremist allies who seek to carry on al-Qaida’s murderous agenda. These are the terrorists we will destroy. These are the extremists we will defeat." Brennan warned that it would be wrong for people to conclude that Obama is not committed to fighting terrorism. "President Obama has articulated a clear policy — to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qaida and its allies," Brennan said. "That is our mission, and the president described it in no uncertain terms in his inaugural when he said, 'Our nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred.' And to win this war against al-Qaida, the administration continues to be unrelenting, using every tool in our toolbox and every arrow in our quiver." Our aim here is not to wade into the war of words over the "war on terror." Rather, we just wanted to see if Hannity was right that Obama won't use the term "war on terrorism." And except in a couple of instances where he used the phrase "war on terror," Obama has generally employed different words. And it's deliberate, as he has explained on several occasions. Obama provides nuanced explanations for his word choices, and you may agree or disagree with them, but the bottom line is that Obama has chosen not to use the phrase "war on terrorism." And so we rate Hannity's statement True.	None	Sean Hannity	None	None	None	2009-11-11T19:19:37	2009-11-09	['None']
pomt-06620	"[Eighty-five percent] of the funds collected in each county will be redistributed elsewhere -- not spent in the county in which it is collected."	false	/georgia/statements/2011/sep/20/debbie-dooley/could-counties-be-out-luck-if-sales-tax-passes/	The road to next year’s referendum on a new sales tax to fund transportation projects in the Atlanta region is getting treacherous for the idea’s supporters. State lawmakers last month punted on a proposal to hold the referendum in November 2012, on the date of the presidential election -- when more Democrats are likely to be at the polls. Experts believe the referendum has more support among Democrats. Political observers called the decision to stick with holding the referendum on the July 2012 primary date a victory for tea party supporters, who said the idea of moving the referendum was tantamount to voter shopping. This month, one active tea party member raised another concern about the tax in an op-ed that was published in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Eighty-five percent "of the funds collected in each county will be redistributed elsewhere -- not spent in the county in which it is collected," Debbie Dooley wrote. "That means if DeKalb County raises hundreds of millions of dollars over a decade and wants to spend it on filling potholes, synchronizing lights or providing turn lanes, it is out of luck. It has to send the money to the region for redistribution on an already-determined project list." Hmmm. Isn’t the reason that leaders in some metro Atlanta counties want the tax is to pay for transportation projects in their communities? The current project list shows nearly $150 million in projects solely for DeKalb County, which Dooley mentioned in her op-ed. Norcross Mayor Bucky Johnson, chairman of the group of regional leaders tasked to come up with a list of projects, said Dooley’s statement doesn’t add up. "If a jurisdiction wasn’t getting their part, you would hear them crying by now," Johnson told us. Dooley cited state Transportation Department reports to back up her argument. "Only 15 percent is guaranteed to stay local," she said. "We don’t know what their [final] project list is going to be," Dooley said. "They’ve got a lot of wiggle room. They can change [the list]." Dooley correctly points out that 15 percent of the money collected in each county must go to that jurisdiction. The remaining 85 percent is put into a pot of money that will pay for various projects that are put on the list, which is supposed to be finalized on Oct. 15. The counties in the Atlanta region are Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, Gwinnett, Henry and Rockdale. If passed by voters, the 10-year, 1 percent sales tax is expected to raise about $6.1 billion for regional transportation projects. Julie Ralston, communcations director for the Atlanta Regional Commission, said each county will get a minimum return of at least 77 percent on what it collects from the tax for those projects in their jurisdiction. "Everyone is getting something beyond their 15 percent," Ralston said. "[Dooley’s statement] is absolutely false." Dooley’s concerns about the tax are twofold. She thinks all the funds collected in a county should be spent in its jurisdiction. Her other problem with the tax is she thinks it is a ruse to expand MARTA, the bus and rail system that currently operates in DeKalb and Fulton counties. "I think they’re using smoke and mirrors on this," she said. Fayette County Commissioner Steve Brown, like Dooley, has his concerns about the tax. For example, he doesn’t think the current list allocates enough money for some projects. Case in point, planned improvements at I-85/ Ga. 74 interchange, which is heavily used by Fayette County residents. There is currently $22.5 million set aside for the project. "To widen the on and off ramps will cost $22 million," he said. "That’s not going to begin to do that project." Brown said he understood Dooley’s concern about the tax, but he doesn’t fully agree with her statement. "Technically, you could have a county on the short end of the stick," he said. "I don’t know if that is going to happen." Johnson said there’s a very small likelihood that Dooley’s concerns are accurate. "I guess that’s a possibility. There could be some changes," he said. "But the point of what we looked at is geographic equity. It is spread out reasonably throughout the district." Johnson added, "Every county is getting at least 75 percent or 80 percent of what they’re putting in." Dooley believes it is the intention of local leaders to use a portion of the 85 percent of money from the tax, if approved, in each county. She is worried, however, that the list will be changed and leave a county without any of that 85 percent. Others closely involved in putting the list together say such a scenario is slim. Rockdale County has only three projects that are solely in its county on the current list. There’s not much concrete at this point to support Dooley’s claim. We rate it False.

pomt-15239	"The Mexican government ... they send the bad ones over."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/06/donald-trump/trump-mexican-government-they-send-bad-ones-over/	In the first Republican primary debate of the 2016 presidential race, billionaire developer Donald Trump -- the leader in recent polls -- made a splash. Early in the debate, Fox News’ Chris Wallace, one of the moderators, pressed Trump on some of his past statements about undocumented immigration -- the signature issue of Trump’s campaign. Wallace asked Trump, "What evidence do you have, specific evidence, that the Mexican government is sending criminals across the border?" Trump cited conversations with "border patrol people" who told him that it was true: "Our leaders are stupid, our politicians are stupid, and the Mexican government is much smarter, much sharper, much more cunning, and they send the bad ones over because they don't want to pay for them, they don't want to take care of them. Why should they, when the stupid leaders of the United States will do it for them?And that’s what’s happening, whether you like it or not." We checked a previous comment by Trump on this topic. In a July 8 interview with NBC, Trump told interviewer Katy Tur, "The Mexican government forces many bad people into our country because they're smart. They're smarter than our leaders, and their negotiators are far better than what we have, to a degree that you wouldn’t believe. They're forcing people into our country. … And they are drug dealers and they are criminals of all kinds. We are taking Mexico’s problems." Is the Mexican government sending people across the border, rather than individuals making decisions on their own to leave in search of seek employment or to join family members in the United States? When we talked to a range of immigration experts, we found wide agreement that that there is no evidence to support Trump’s claim. For evidence, we started with the Mexican Migration Project, a bi-national research effort founded in 1982 to study Mexican migration to the United States. Anthropologists, sociologists and other experts with the project gather data, including field interviews with migrants, that illuminate migration patterns. The co-director of the project is Douglas Massey, a professor of sociology and public policy at Princeton University. Based on more than three decades of field research, Massey found Trump’s assertion to be flat wrong. He pointed to findings from a paper he published in 2014 in the journal International Migration Review. In the paper, he and his co-authors concluded that undocumented migration from Mexico "was driven largely by U.S. labor demand and by the existence of well-developed migrant networks that provided migrants with access to U.S. labor markets despite a rising enforcement effort. The taking of additional trips is likewise tied to U.S. labor demand and access to migrant networks, as well as the number of U.S. trips a migrant has accumulated over his or her career." What about Mexican government efforts to push migrants into the United States? Nonexistent, Massey told PolitiFact. "Mexico has never had a policy of pushing migrants toward the United States, much less ‘forcing many bad people into our country,’ " Massey said. "Mexican migration is tied to social and economic circumstances on both sides of the border." Other experts sided with Massey. "Immigrants come to work or to join family," said Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer with the Pew Research Center’s Hispanic Trends Project. "And no, the Mexican government doesn’t force anyone to leave." "No, the Mexican government doesn't force anyone to move here illegally, though it certainly doesn't object," added Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors low levels of immigration. Tom Smith, a demographer at the University of Chicago, drew a contrast with one historical example in which a government did take a role in pushing certain people to emigrate to the United States -- the Mariel boatlift from Cuba in 1980. "While most immigrants were simply part of the general Cuban population of people wanting to emigrate, it appears that the Cuban government did intentionally send a disproportionate number of those they deemed to be undesirables, including prisoners and other institutionalized groups," Smith said. But there is no such evidence that the same thing has happened in Mexico, he added. About the closest support for Trump’s claim that we could find is the argument that the Mexican government’s failure to provide strong economic growth and restrain drug violence has been a factor in convincing people to leave the country and come to the United States. Still, it’s not accurate to equate the Mexican government’s inability to accomplish these goals and the idea that the government is pushing people out. It’s also worth noting that migration from Mexico to the United States has been declining in recent years. This is due to demographic factors more than anything else, Massey said. Trump "does not seem to have gotten the memo, but undocumented migration stopped in 2008 and has been zero or negative since -- not because the economic fundamentals have changed, but because the fertility rate dropped from 6.7 births per woman in 1970 to 2.2 births today, bringing about an aging of the population," Massey said. "People initiate migration between the ages of 18 and 30, and if they don't migrate then, they are unlikely ever to migrate." In other words, Massey said, the number of people in the age category most conducive to immigration is dropping, so immigration is dropping as well. Our ruling Trump said, "The Mexican government ... they send the bad ones over." Setting aside the question of whether Mexicans who have come to the United States are "bad" or not, we found no evidence of any Mexican policy that pushes people out of Mexico and into the United States. As has been the case for decades, a combination of economic and family factors accounts for most of the migration from Mexico to the United States. For the second time, we rate this claim Pants on Fire.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2015-08-06T22:12:35	2015-08-06	['Mexico']
pomt-09546	"We're also cutting a Forest Service economic development program that strayed so far from any mission that it funded a music festival."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/04/barack-obama/obama-proposed-axe-budget-forest-service-program-v/	In remarks after unveiling his proposed 2011 budget on Feb. 1, President Barack Obama spoke of the need to rein in spending by cutting "what doesn't work to pay for what does." Obama boasted that the administration has gone through every department's spending "line by line" looking for "inefficiency, duplication and programs that have outlived their usefulness." Last year, he said, the administration found $17 billion in cuts; and "this year, we've already found $20 billion." And then Obama threw out a few "commonsense" examples: "We cut $115 million from a program that pays states to clean up mines that have already been cleaned up," Obama said. "We're also cutting a Forest Service economic development program that strayed so far from any mission that it funded a music festival." We'll briefly touch on the first example later, but we want to focus on that second one, the proposal to eliminate the $5 million budget for a Forest Service economic development program "that strayed so far from any mission that it funded a music festival." Forest Service officials told us the Economic Action Program (EAP) was created in the 1990s to stimulate and assist natural resource-dependent rural communities and natural resource-based businesses to pursue self-sufficiency and sustainability. And what about the music festival Obama mentioned? It's true. The EAP awarded a $10,000 grant to the Pacific County (Washington) Economic Development Council -- which it leveraged with $57,075 of its own funds -- to "provide partial funding for operation of the 1997 Water Music Festival including hiring local and regional artists and musicians. The Festival will help to enhance tourism and provide cultural opportunities for the small communities in southern Pacific County." In case you missed it in the middle of the sentence, we reiterate: The music festival was in 1997! The first year of Bill Clinton's second presidential term. The year Comet Hale-Bopp made its closest approach to Earth and the English Patient won the Oscar for Best Picture. Asked about the festival, Becky Rine, a spokeswoman for the Forest Service, explained via e-mail that "in the late 1990s, the Forest Service awarded a number of small grants to the state of Washington to help small communities hurt by the economic downturn following decreased logging (associated with the spotted owl). Project selection was based on the ability to implement the project quickly and put people to work, as hundreds of logging mills were shut down in the Northwest." "The music festival funding was not earmarked," Rine stated. "The grant was part of a multiagency revitalization effort for the Pacific Northwest." The EAP has not funded a music festival since. Still, Forest Service spokesman Joe Walsh acknowledged, "For sure, that went beyond the scope of the forestry service. We concur that it does not serve the interests of the agency." But what does the EAP fund these days? Is it still funding projects that stray from the Forest Service mission? We asked the Forest Service press office several times for a list of last year's grant recipients. We finally got this e-mail response from Rine: "Since 2002, specific funding for projects has not been determined by the Forest Service, because they have been enacted by Congress." Can you say earmarks? In its formal budget proposal documents, the White House states that the EAP has provided funding for projects that have "marginal relation to the mission of the Forest Service or to forestry in general," though it doesn't provide a timeline. It lists several examples, including the music festival, and adds that "the program is also duplicative of other USDA programs that can address priority needs in rural areas and assist forest-based industries." It's almost the identical argument made by the Obama administration when it proposed that the program be cut last year. Congress funded it with $5 million anyway. In fact, it's also the same argument made by the Bush administration, when in 2008 it proposed to ax the EAP's funding. Congress awarded the program nearly $5 million that year, too. Clearly, this program has a patron (or patrons) in Congress who keeps shoving the money back in. But good luck finding out who that (or they) might be, said Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan Washington advocacy group that tracks government spending and highlights waste. The same scenario is true for the first example cited by Obama, the proposal to cut $115 million "from a program that pays states to clean up mines that have already been cleaned up." Obama proposed a similar cut last year, as did Bush the year before. In other words, Obama administration officials may have gone through the budget line-by-line to find waste, but these two examples were initially identified as wasteful or duplicative by the Bush administration. And when Obama says the administration found $17 billion in cuts last year, and $20 billion so far this year, we're not talking about $37 billion in total cuts. "A lot of the cuts are repeat customers from last year," Ellis said. Interestingly, Obama did not mention the biggest-ticket item on his list this year, the plan to cut nearly $3.5 billion from NASA's Constellation Systems Program, which aimed to resume manned missions to the moon. That proposed cut is not sitting well with some legislators in Florida, home of the Kennedy Space Center, and they have vowed to fight to have the funding restored. When it comes to the two examples cited earlier, we think it's misleading for Obama to say "we found" them. Both of the cuts were suggested by Bush in 2008. We also think Obama's remarks suggest the administration has identified $20 billion in cuts this year in addition to the $17 billion in cuts it found last year. In fact, many of the proposed cuts this year are repeats from last year that were ultimately overridden by Congress. The two examples cited by Obama here make for good belt-tightening sound bites. But this strikes us as part of the annual budget dance that happens every year: The administration proposes cuts it knows full well will be restored by some anonymous member of Congress who supports the program. And maybe the Forest Service's EAP program is "not targeted" or duplicative, as Obama's budget documents suggest, but it's misleading for Obama to employ a way-back machine to discredit a $5 million Forest Service program by citing a $10,000 grant awarded for a music festival in 1997, during the Clinton administration. And so we rule his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-10464	Barack Obama's health care plan "will cost taxpayers $1,700 more to cover each new person."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/21/hillary-clinton/hard-numbers-are-just-guess-timates/	Sen. Hillary Clinton has a new health care ad in Pennsylvania in which she accuses Sen. Barack Obama of attacking her, and then takes a few jabs at him. Obama's plan "will cost taxpayers $1,700 more to cover each new person," Clinton's ad states. "Obama's health care plan leaves 15-million people with no coverage." We've previously checked her statement that Obama's plan leaves 15-million people without coverage and found it to be Half True . For evidence that Obama's plan will cost $1,700 more, the Clinton campaign pointed to a blog post by Paul Krugman of the New York Times. Krugman believes Clinton's plan, with its universal mandate that requires every person to have health insurance, is superior to Obama's plan, which does not. Krugman's numbers come from a study by Jonathan Gruber, an economist with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Gruber's latest working paper is about covering the uninsured in the United States. Gruber studied broad models for providing health insurance, comparing a plan that includes a mandate with one that does not. Krugman and Clinton's ad both correctly note that the per-person cost difference between the two models is about $1,700 per year. But as Krugman notes, the models, while "broadly similar" to Clinton's and Obama's health plans, are not the same. For one thing, Obama's plan has a mandate for children, so it is not the same as a plan with no mandates at all. Also, experts we've interviewed previously about the Clinton and Obama health plans have emphasized the difficulty of putting hard numbers to the campaign proposals. The proposals are broad outlines and contain little in the way of hard numbers for subsidies or eligibility for subsidized insurance. This makes it hard to say exactly how much the plans will cost. ( We looked at this point previously when Obama said his plan would save more .) So Clinton's ad is pushing the envelope quite a bit to say that her plan would save $1,700 per person. Yes, there is evidence that a mandate lowers costs for everyone, but whether $1,700 would be the difference between her and Obama's plan is a different matter. We find her statement to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00187	Says Patrick Henry said, "The Constitution is not a document for the government to restrain the people: it is an instrument for the people to restrain the government."	false	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/oct/19/blog-posting/bloggers-spreading-false-patrick-henry-quote-limit/	Did Patrick Henry, the patriot best known for saying, "Give me liberty or give me death," assert that, "The Constitution is not a document for the government to restrain the people: it is an instrument for the people to restrain the government"? In a Facebook post, Sean O'Brien suggests that there are allegations that Henry never uttered those words, but he dismissed them. "There are people accusing me of this quote being fake. I can assure you, there is some evidence that Patrick Henry did say this, and if you want to call it fake, you’re really missing the actual message of it. Who said it isn’t as relevant as the message itself!!!" The Oct. 2, 2018, post has been shared more than 43,000 times. The sentiment has also been used by politicians such as Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Readers are free to embrace the message, but to say Henry or any other famous person said something he didn't is an example of fake news. In this case, the attribution is designed to give a statement extra gravitas by attributing it to a founding father. So whether Henry said it or not is important. When we asked O'Brien for evidence that Henry was the author, he quickly responded via Facebook Messenger that the only thing he could find was a reference at goodreads.com, which does not cite a source. "As to whether he actually said it, none of us were alive back in the 18th century to know for certain about this," he said. The meme, complete with flawed punctuation, says it was created by ConstitutingAmerica.org, which didn't respond to an email asking for its source. Evidence that the quote is a fabrication has been around for years. In 2012, Thomas S. Kidd, distinguished professor of history at Baylor University and author of "Patrick Henry: First Among Patriots" said it as one of several bogus Henry quotes on the Internet. The earliest reference he could find at the time was from a pair of books published in 2003. "Why create a bogus quotation when Henry actually said similar things about the need to restrain government?" Kidd wrote. Since the essay, Kidd said in an email, "I still have never seen any information that would suggest that this is a legitimate Henry quote." Jon Kukla, historian and author of the 2017 book "Patrick Henry: Champion of Liberty" and former director of Red Hill -- The Patrick Henry National Memorial in Charlotte County, Virginia, agreed via Facebook Messenger, "Regardless of sentiment — these words are NOT Patrick Henry's." The "phrasing strikes me as very 20th century," he wrote. "And I'm afraid there are several more bogus Henry quotes floating in cyberspace along with bogus quotes from other founders. I have never understood why advocates of any cause stoop to inventing quotations? Wouldn't you want to know that your cause is true? How can you do that if you're making up fake quotations. It's beyond me." We rate the claim as False.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2018-10-19T12:51:32	2018-10-02	['None']

pomt-01964	ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi was "released by Obama in 2009."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/19/jeanine-pirro/foxs-pirro-obama-set-isis-leader-free-2009/	The march of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, across a swath of Iraq has fractured a nation and spurred Republican attacks that the Obama administration is on the verge of "snatching defeat from the jaws of victory." Fox News host Jeanine Pirro tied President Barack Obama to the roots of the current assault. On June 14, Pirro offered listeners this insight into the ISIS leader. (ISIS is also called ISIL, for Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.) "The head of this band of savages is a man named Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, the new Osama Bin Laden," Pirro said. "A man released by Obama in 2009, who started ISIS a year later. And when Baghdadi left Camp Bucca, where the worst of the worst were held in Iraq, he threatened his American jailers saying, ‘I’ll see you in New York.’ " A reader wanted to know if Obama actually released Baghdadi, and we decided to look into it. Whatever the truth, the assertion has gained traction. For the president’s critics this fits with their disdain for the recent prisoner swap that freed Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl in exchange for five Taliban leaders who had been kept at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Red State, a conservative blog, used the Baghdadi connection to talk about Obama’s "catch-and-release" policy. We have two elements to verify. Was Baghdadi in U.S. custody in 2009 and did Obama have a direct connection to his release? We’ll deal with them in order. Will the real Abu Bakr al Baghdadi please stand up There have been several articles -- from Slate, and NBC among others -- that place Baghdadi at a detention facility in Iraq called Camp Bucca in 2009 (when Obama would have been president). However, all the talk tracks back to a Daily Beast interview with Army Col. Kenneth King, the former commander of Camp Bucca. That article said King knew Baghdadi at the camp and that he didn’t expect to see him become the leader of a spectacularly vicious and brutal movement. "I’m not surprised that it was someone who spent time in Bucca but I’m a little surprised it was him," King said. "He was a bad dude, but he wasn’t the worst of the worst." In this storyline, Baghdadi was handed over to Iraqi justice system late in 2009 shortly before Camp Bucca closed. However, when PunditFact asked the Defense Department to confirm the story, officials there said Baghdadi was released in 2004, not 2009. "Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim Al Badry, also known as ‘Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’ was held as a ‘civilian internee’ by U.S. Forces-Iraq from early February 2004 until early December 2004, when he was released," the Pentagon said in a statement. "He was held at Camp Bucca. A Combined Review and Release Board recommended ‘unconditional release’ of this detainee and he was released from U.S. custody shortly thereafter. We have no record of him being held at any other time." In short, according to the Defense Department, the man who heads ISIS was released in 2004, long before Obama took office, and was not recaptured. ABC News also has questioned King’s recollection, citing a "a U.S. official" that Baghdadi was not in American custody in 2009. "I could be mistaken," King told ABC News, "but I’m 99 percent. He’s a dead ringer for the guy I had the run-in with … His face is very familiar." King declined to comment to PunditFact. A troubled detention policy If Baghdadi wasn’t in American custody in 2009 as Defense Department officials say, then there’s no way Obama could be to blame. But even if he was, the link between the ISIS leader and the American president are flimsy because the framework was set in in 2008 while George W. Bush was president. A little backstory. By July 2005, the United States had four detention facilities -- two near Baghdad, one in the northeastern corner of the country, and Camp Bucca in the far southeastern corner near the Kuwait border. The entire operation was known as Task Force 134. In the course of the war, some 80,000 people passed through these centers, according to the Defense Department. A Pentagon-commissioned study by RAND, a private policy analysis group, described a system that struggled with competing expectations. The incoming population was a mix of captured Sunni and Shiite militants, people rounded up in military raids and ordinary criminals. At times, a blend of overcrowding and sectarian animosities led to riots. The RAND study also said the 2007 "surge" -- the addition of 20,000 new troops into Iraq to quell spreading unrest -- pushed detainee levels to over 25,000 people. From 2007-08, Navy Captain Brian J. Bill served as the legal adviser to Detainee Operations for the Multi-National Force in Iraq. Bill described the process of vetting inmates in the U.S. Naval War College journal, International Law Studies. The military established nine review boards, working six days a week, to hear 20 cases each day. Bill reported that when the boards first began they released about 25 percent of the individuals who came before them. Later, that rose to 40 percent. The end of the detention policy At the end Bush’s second term in 2008, American and Iraqi negotiators moved toward getting the United States out of the business of holding large numbers of Iraqis. Robert Chesney, professor of international security law at the University of Texas School of Law, said neither side wanted to see the network of detention centers continue. "Its demise reflected a deliberate policy choice by the United States and Iraq to phase out that system and to rely instead on the Iraqi criminal justice system as the sole mechanism for detention going forward," Chesney wrote in 2011. That goal became part of the U.S.-Iraq Status of Forces Agreement, signed in November 2008. Under that agreement the United States agreed to "turn over custody of such wanted detainees to Iraqi authorities pursuant to a valid Iraqi arrest warrant and shall release all the remaining detainees in a safe and orderly manner." The United States continued to hold about 200 prisoners judged to pose the greatest risk. They were what remained from a group that numbered about 14,000 at the start of 2009. "Aside from the so-called ‘Deck of Cards’ detainees held at Camp Cropper (the top leaders in Saddam Hussein’s government), it’s hard to imagine how anyone in Washington would have any interest in who we held or released," Bill told PunditFact. "By the end of 2009, it’s hard to imagine how we could have continued to hold anyone if the Iraqis themselves didn’t decide to detain them." Our ruling Pirro said that Obama released the current head of ISIS from government custody in 2009. The Defense Department said that the man now known as Baghdadi was released in 2004. The evidence that Baghdadi was still in custody in 2009 appears to be the recollection of an Army colonel who said Baghdadi’s "face is very familiar." Even if the colonel is right, Baghdadi was not set free; he was handed over to the Iraqis who released him some time later. But more important, the legal contract between the United States and Iraq that guaranteed that the United States would give up custody of virtually every detainee was signed during the Bush administration. It would have required an extraordinary effort to have held on to Baghdadi and there is no evidence that he was on anyone’s radar screen, assuming that he was in custody at all in 2009. The U.S.-Iraq agreement drove the release of thousands of detainees in 2009, but Obama had nothing to do with that. We rate the claim False.

pomt-06205	"Ohio’s Planned Parenthood operations received millions of taxpayer dollars via federal grants in 2010 and 2011."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/dec/09/ohio-right-life/ohio-right-life-says-millions-federal-aid-went-sta/	Ohio and several other states across the country this year have passed laws to restrict abortion rights, including legislation to defund Planned Parenthood, a nonprofit organization that provides health care services, including abortions. Ohio lawmakers, who already have passed a late-term abortion ban and other anti-abortion measures this year, have just begun hearings on Senate Bill 201, which is designed to defund Planned Parenthood and other family planning centers. The day before the first Senate hearing on SB 201, Ohio Right to Life, an anti-abortion group, promoted the proposed law as a key component of its agenda. "Ohio’s Planned Parenthood operations received millions of taxpayer dollars via federal grants in 2010 and 2011," a Dec. 5 news release from Ohio Right to Life said. Ohio Right to Life went on to say that Planned Parenthood has performed more abortions annually as its federal funding has increased. It lauds the bill as one that will direct funding away from abortion providers and calls the hearings on the bill a step toward making 2012 a "groundbreaking year for Ohio's pro-life movement." PolitiFact Ohio decided to examine Ohio Right to Life’s claim about public funding of Planned Parenthood, in light of its underlying contention that the funding of the agency supports abortion. We asked Michael Gonidakis, executive director for Ohio Right to Life, for specifics on the taxpayer money Planned Parenthood has received. Gonidakis said state agencies disbursed the federal grants, authorizing more than $1.6 million in 2010 to Planned Parenthood locations in Ohio and more than $1.7 million this year. He also provided a memo the nonpartisan Ohio Legislative Service Commission prepared detailing state agencies’ disbursement of federal grants to Planned Parenthood branches in Ohio. LSC compiled the information for Rep. Kristina Roegner, a Republican from Hudson who is a primary sponsor on companion legislation introduced in the House to defund Planned Parenthood. Roegner’s office confirmed the memo’s authenticity. Tara Broderick, president and chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood of Northeast Ohio, said the organization does receive federal grant money. But none of that money pays for abortions, she said. "A huge myth," Broderick said. "Absolutely I can say taxpayer money is not used for abortion services," she said. Planned Parenthood must sign an agreement affirming it will not use taxpayer money to provide, promote or refer abortion services, said a spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Health, which distributes the bulk of federal grant money that Planned Parenthood receives. Additionally, an audit is performed to account for the organization’s use of government dollars, Broderick said. According to Planned Parenthood, the vast majority of its clients receive health care services such as Pap tests, birth control and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases. Less than 4 percent of Ohio Planned Parenthood clients received an abortion, the organization stated. Nationally, Planned Parenthood performed 332,278 abortion procedures in 2009, the most recent year data was available. Those procedures made up 3 percent of the organization’s services, according to a Planned Parenthood fact sheet that was last updated in October. Gonidakis, of Ohio Right to Life, acknowledged that the federal Hyde Amendment and state law prohibits tax dollars for paying for abortions. "However, the significant public dollars Planned Parenthood does receive keeps them afloat and pays for pretty much their entire operations," he said in an e-mail. Not true, said Broderick, of Planned Parenthood of Northeast Ohio. She said the federal dollars make up 16 percent of the branch’s budget. So where does that leave us? Ohio Right to Life is correct to say that Planned Parenthood locations in Ohio have received millions in federal grants. But the connection between Planned Parenthood’s federal funding and its abortion services is not as direct as Ohio Right to Life’s news release implies. Federal law bars Planned Parenthood from using taxpayer money for abortions, and the agency must certify to the state that it does not do so. The money that would be redirected by S.B. 201 is used to provide other health services. Ohio Right to Life’s claim about funding for Planned Parenthood is accurate. That the money cannot be used for abortions and that abortion procedures make up a small percentage of Planned Parenthood services are additional pieces of information that provide the full picture. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Ohio Right to Life	None	None	None	2011-12-09T06:00:00	2011-12-05	['Ohio', 'Planned_Parenthood']
pomt-02003	Jason Carter supports using Georgia tax dollars to promote Obamacare	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2014/jun/11/republican-governors-association/gop-misfires-carter-claim/	Death and taxes have nothing on the inevitability of attack ads during election season. And since we live in Georgia – where an Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll in May found that 86 percent of voters see a candidate’s stance on the Affordable Care Act as a very important factor in their vote – it was another certainty that the federal health care overhaul also known as Obamacare would get prime billing. Enter "Bad Idea," a Republican Governors Association ad against Jason Carter, the Democratic state senator locked in a tight race against Gov. Nathan Deal. It opens with claims that health care premiums will increase under the law before asking why Carter would say expanding the Medicaid program to more low-income Georgians "should be on the table." Then, the hammer: "And why would Jason Carter support using Georgia tax dollars to promote Obamacare?" it asks. Carter’s staff disagrees with that assessment, saying his vote on an anti-Obamacare bill was about information, not taxpayer money. And that’s exactly the sort of conflict that sets the PolitiFact Truth-O-Meter aquiver. Jon Thompson, the RGA’s press secretary, pointed us to House Bill 943, which bars state or local government employees from advocating for the Affordable Care Act and prevents creation of a state-run health insurance exchange. It also prohibits the use of state or local money to hire people to help Georgians sign up for coverage under the law. Carter was among 17 senators who voted against the measure, 16 of them Democrats. "This law says we will not use our resources to implement a federal policy that our state disagrees with," said state Rep. Edward Lindsey, R-Atlanta. Lindsey wrote the amendment that watered down a previous bill, House Bill 707, that aimed to bar any state or local government agency from using money or resources to implement, not just promote, Obamacare. "Essentially, it is a statement from Georgia," Lindsey added. William Custer, the director of the Center for Health Services Research at Georgia State University, notes that Obamacare remains the law of the land, though. Even in Georgia. Even with House Bill 943. To that end, the bill as passed mostly prohibits what Georgia already didn’t plan to do – Deal had previously said he would not set up a state-run health exchange – and limits speech by public employees on taxpayers’ time, Custer said. "It’s certainly reasonable that a person could vote no on that because of First Amendment concerns or objection to the state telling local government what to do," he said. "As such, it was a message law. " Carter read the restrictions in the bill as banning Georgia from accepting federal dollars, not using state dollars, to help explain the overhaul to constituents, said his spokesman, Bryan Thomas. "Whatever anyone’s opinion on Obamacare, it’s a huge change to federal health care law," Thomas said. "(Carter) voted no because this bill prevented state and local government agencies from helping people understand that massive change." Carter did not issue a public statement to that end on the day of the vote, Day 39 of the 40-day session. In fact, he has remained mostly noncommittal about his thoughts on Obamacare in general as well as specific pieces of the law. That leaves his few statements open for interpretation – and political attack. This week, Carter told the AJC that expanding Medicaid would be one way to secure federal money to help keep rural hospitals open in the state. But Thomas, when asked whether Carter supports Medicaid expansion, said the candidate would also look at whether Georgia could get the same deal that Arkansas secured, to take new Medicaid money from the federal government to help the uninsured poor buy insurance on the private market. Thomas called it "a false choice" to answer yes or no if Carter would support Medicaid expansion as governor. "It’s not a yes or no question," Thomas said. That kind of non-answer answer does Carter no favors. Mischaracterizing his stance isn’t hard to do when he won’t give clear answers to the policy questions on voters’ minds. In summary, though, it is still a stretch to conclude that Carter’s objection to one anti-Obamacare bill translates into support for spending state taxpayer money on the law. PolitiFact could not find any specific tax increase that Carter supported as a state senator, shoring up his office’s claims that it would be out of the norm for him to vote in favor of a measure if he believed it would increase taxes. But because Carter’s stance has been so fuzzy, it opens the door for interpretation about what he really believes. We rate the GOP claim as Mostly False.

pomt-15116	Atlanta has issued an increasing number of citations - and collected an increasing amount of revenue - since Mayor Kasim Reed took office in 2010.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/sep/11/reader-email/are-citations-and-revenue-atlanta/	Anyone who has landed in a speed trap in some never-before-mentioned small town on I-75 in South Georgia understands the most basic example of policing for profit. A 2014 analysis by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution of five years of traffic fines paid in every police jurisdiction in the state – more than 500 in all – exposed numerous departments raking in exorbitant fine amounts. Atlanta collected below the metro region average of $116 per capita in fines, but still netted $50.6 million, or $112.98 for every person in the city. A scathing U.S. Department of Justice Department report found a more troubling kind of policing for profit in Ferguson, Mo., saying the city’s court system worked in tandem with police to charge escalating fines for minor offenses such as traffic violations in order to raise revenue. A reader reached out via email, arguing Atlanta actually mirrored the troubled Missouri city under Mayor Kasim Reed, when looking at all citations, not just traffic tickets, all in the name of generating income. Had Atlanta issued an increasing number of citations – and collected more money – since Reed took office? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check. Reed spokeswoman Anne Torres said traffic citations play an important role in overall public safety. There are more citations now, she said, because Reed has put more cops on the street in a bid to make Atlanta safer. "With hundreds of additional officers on patrol, and special tactical units assigned to traffic enforcement, the number of citations issued today versus 2009 will be significantly different, " Torres said in an emailed statement. By the numbers The reader email claimed that the number of tickets and citations issued in Atlanta had grown 20 percent during Reed’s tenure, from 337,697 in 2010 to 404,652 in 2014. Those numbers, he said, came from the Atlanta Police’s website, which includes data downloads, and a record request for the number of citations issued annually by PARK-atlanta, the name of the city’s outsourced parking enforcement. City leaders agreed in 2009 to a seven-year contract with Milwaukee-based Duncan Solutions to take charge of ticketing illegally parked vehicles and to install hundreds of parking meters across the city. Duncan agreed to pay the city $5.5 million a year under the PARK-atlanta program and keeps any additional money collected. That deal was problematic within days of beginning, with residents, business owners and patrons complaining that PARK-atlanta was too aggressive in its enforcement. Our reader attached a 2011 quote from Reed that he contends shows the reason for the complaints: a push for new revenue. "I think that if we do it well that that is an area to generate approximately $10 million dollars or more in revenue. We are going to have robust traffic enforcement and the court needs to be prepared to handle those cases because that is how revenue is being lost," the quote read. "We could ethically and appropriately, carrying out an essential government function, have a significant spike in revenue while protecting people," the quote continued. "Revenue is being lost." We were able to confirm the quote, part of Reed’s response to whether the increased enforcement would pay for the judges necessary to oversee the court, not pad the city budget. More problematic was coming up with the actual numbers of citations issued in Atlanta every year. The reader provided us with data from PARK-atlanta showing the number of annual citations. City officials confirmed the numbers are: 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 141,156 220,185 221,119 200,078 196,895 That’s a 40 percent increase in citations in five years. But remember, the city collects a set amount - $5.5 million a year – to hand over the enforcement to PARK-atlanta.So there is no reason for the city or Reed to encourage more citations. It’s a different story at the Atlanta Municipal Court, which handles the citations issued by Atlanta Police. The number cases handled each year are: 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 260,982 288,820 309,529 261,704 269,257 The city court collected $19.33 million from all fines and other sources, including fines and fees such as those associated with controversial private probation in 2010. By 2014, that number had grown to $27.94 million – a 45 percent increase in money that goes to the city’s general fund to pay for police, courts and other basic government needs. Torres said some increase would be expected, in part because Reed kept a campaign promise to grow the city’s police department. The department is constantly in flux but ended 2010 with 1,770 officers and ended 2014 with 1,936 (after briefly reaching Reed’s long-sought goal of 2,000 officers in 2013). Even accounting for attrition, that’s a 9 percent increase in the number of police on patrol in Atlanta. And that growth came on the heels of furloughs that reduced manpower in the police department by as much as 10 percent in 2009 because of the city’s financial woes during the economic downturn. In the meantime, Reed canceled red light cameras, and that revenue, in 2014 and has said he isn’t opposed to ending the deal with PARK-atlanta when it expires. That helps show the jump in tickets, and revenue, stems from the increased focus on public safety and is hardly a driver of the city’s budget, Torres added. Citations accounted for 3.5 percent of the city’s $552 million general operating fund in 2010 and about 5 percent of the $565 million operating fund last year. "It’s not a money maker to just issue tickets," Torres said. "The reason the city has a surplus today is because of pension reform, not revenue from traffic tickets. " Beyond Atlanta That brings us back to places like Ferguson. Atlanta doesn’t set policing policies in a vacuum. And given all of the problems cited in the Justice Department report, the city’s attitude about tickets is "remarkable," said Karin Martin, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. "I think you can’t really divine motivation," Martin said. "The language being used about increasing revenue is problem enough. Atlanta has its own socio-economic and racial divides, so who is subjected to this police force and is the proportion reflected by the population?" In other words, is Atlanta over-policing specific segments of the community with its citations? We didn’t get demographic details on citations, so that much is unknown. Given the city’s population grows by about half every workday, many of the citations are expected to be against people who live outside Atlanta but travel into it for jobs or special events. While research would support that an increase in police officers would increase citations, Martin said those studies generally focus on foot patrols and so-called community policing that assign officers to the narrow areas to build visibility and trust. If visitors turn out to be the bulk of those cited, it effectively makes the tickets a tourist tax, not the result of renewed enforcement in unsafe areas, Martin said. "If people are afraid of having their purse snatched or to walk alone because of crime, you would have a reason to approach traffic enforcement as increased policing," she said. "But that doesn’t appear to be the explicit need here, which raises the speculation about motive." Our ruling A reader reached out to PolitiFact Georgia, claiming Atlanta has issued an increasing number of misdemeanor citations since Mayor Kasim Reed took office in 2010. The reason was money, the reader argued. We couldn’t confirm the numbers the reader had calculated. But our research showed that tickets issued since Reed took office have increased, both when issued by city police and the city’s outsourced parking enforcer. Combined, the number of citations increased about 16 percent in that time – and the revenue collected from them swelled a whopping 45 percent. City leaders have a point that some growth would be expected, given the private parking enforcement and the increase in officers in the city. Proving the motivation – increased revenue, more focused policing or a combination of both – is difficult, if not impossible, to pinpoint. But even with the caveats, the statistics back up the claim about ticket and revenue growth. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Reader	None	None	None	2015-09-11T00:00:00	2015-09-03	['Kasim_Reed']
pomt-14470	"There have been multiple media reports about (Donald Trump's) business dealings with the mob, with the mafia."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/02/ted-cruz/yes-donald-trump-has-been-linked-mob/	Donald Trump "seems terrified to release his taxes" because they may reveal his true net worth, his donations to liberal causes, or something even seedier, Sen. Ted Cruz suggested on Meet the Press. "There have been multiple media reports about Donald's business dealings with the mob, with the mafia," Cruz said Feb. 28. "Maybe his taxes show those business dealings are a lot more extensive than has been reported." Pressed by host Chuck Todd to back up his claim, Cruz cited reports by ABC and CNN. A Cruz spokesman forwarded us several other media reports detailing the real estate developer’s alleged ties to organized crime. The Trump campaign did not get back to us. Is Cruz right that the Donald has worked with a few Dons in his career? HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRA FACT-CHECKER It’s important to note that Trump hasn’t been charged with any illegal activity, and it’s reasonable to argue that he was unaware or even a victim in some cases. But Cruz has a point that the mogul has been linked to the mob for decades. Mob control a ‘fact of life’ Before we detail Trump’s alleged ties, none of this proves that Trump was happy doing business with the mafia or even in cahoots with them at all. La Cosa Nostra had a virtual monopoly on concrete in New York at the time Trump was adding his name to its skyline in the 1980s. And the mafia’s control over building supplies and labor unions meant that the crime families had a hand in most construction projects in Manhattan. Trump and other major developers "had to adapt to that situation" or build elsewhere, said James B. Jacobs, a mafia expert who was part of a state task force on organized crime. "That was the fact of life, that was the way it was," he told PolitiFact. "The contractors and developers weren’t pure victims. You could bribe the mob-controlled union leaders and get relief from the more arduous conflicts. But we had no information that Trump was any different." That being said, Trump’s business dealings with the mob or mob-related characters are widely documented. Let’s run through them. Mafia concrete for Trump Plaza Trump was first tied to the mafia in the 1980s, when a $7.8 million subcontract for Trump Plaza was awarded to S&A Concrete, according to Fortune. The company, as Cruz correctly says, was partially owned by Anthony "Fat Tony" Salerno, the boss of the Genovese crime family. Trump himself acknowledged as much in a December 2015 interview with the Wall Street Journal, admitting that S&A Concrete was "supposedly associated with the mob." "Virtually every building that was built was built with these companies," he said, adding, "These guys were excellent contractors. They were phenomenal. They could do three floors a week in concrete. Nobody else in the world could do three floors a week. I mean they were unbelievable. Trump Tower, other buildings." When Salerno was indicted in 1986, the charges specifically mentioned Trump Plaza. Salerno’s 1992 obituary ends with a nod to the luxury highrise and 15 other Manhattan buildings. Trump World Tower, supported by the Quadrozzi Concrete Company, is also tangentially related to La Cosa Nostra. The head of the company, John Quadrozzi Sr., was tied to the Lucchese crime family and indicted for making illegal payoffs to the mob in 1992. TIME and Daily Beast have speculated that Trump Tower was also built with mafia influence, though the evidence is less concrete. Atlantic City partnerships Trump’s alleged mob dealings were not confined to New York. According to reports from the Huffington Post and Philadelphia Inquirer, Trump made a deal in Atlantic City with Kenneth Shapiro, an associate of mob boss Nicky Scarfo, and mob-connected labor boss Daniel Sullivan. Trump seemed aware of this, calling Shapiro "a third-rate, local real estate mafia" and Sullivan "the guy who killed Jimmy Hoffa." Nonetheless, in 1981, Trump leased a portion of the land for Trump Plaza and Casino from a company the two men controlled, according a report by New Jersey gaming regulators. The company refused to cooperate with the authorities, and Trump eventually ended the partnership and bought out their shares. Later Trump brought on Sullivan as a labor negotiator at the Grand Hyatt Hotel and introduced the man to his own banker, according to the Los Angeles Times. Through intermediaries Trump bought the property for the casino from the "crown prince" of the Philadelphia mob, Salvatore Testa, for $1.1 million in 1982. Multiple media reports and an unauthorized biography about Trump allege this was more than twice its market value. (Testa purchased the property in 1977 for $195,000.) According to The Federalist, two construction companies controlled by Nicky Scarfo ended up building Trump Plaza and Casino. "You had contractors that were supposedly mob-oriented all over Atlantic City," Trump said when the Wall Street Journal asked him about it, adding that "every single casino company used the same companies, just I hope you will say that." A few years later, Trump’s organized crime connections extended overseas. In 1992, a Senate subcommittee named Danny Leung, who was then the vice president for foreign marketing at Trump Taj Mahal, as an associate of the Hong Kong-based organized crime group 14K Triad. "Leung has also given complimentary tickets for hotel rooms and Asian shows to numerous members and associates of Asian organized crime," reads the report, which also identified three other triad-connected business associates or former employees of Trump’s gambling empire. According to gaming regulators, Leung "flew in 16 Italian organized crime figures from Canada who stole more than $1 million from the casino in a credit scam," reported the New York Daily News in 1995. "The incident was never reported because Trump never filed charges." Leung, who had a separate contract to bring gamblers from Toronto to the casino, denied the affiliation to organized crime, and his casino and junket licenses were renewed. (The Trump Taj Mahal declared bankruptcy in 1991, and his other Atlantic City properties folded a decade later.) Mob-linked business adviser And there’s Felix Sater, "a twice-convicted Russian émigré who served prison time and had documented mafia connections" and the subject of the ABC story Cruz referenced. Sater pleaded guilty to a charge of money laundering in 1998 and was indicted again in 2000 for taking part in a $40 million stock scheme involving four Mafia families, according to the New York Times report. From 2003 to 2007, Sater traveled the country promoting projects for Trump, and his company was a partner in the Trump SoHo hotel. Trump told the Times he "never knew that." Three years later, Sater returned to the Trump Organization and had business cards that described him as Trump’s "senior advisor," the AP reported. Trump told the AP that he’s "not familiar" with Sater. Our ruling Cruz said, "There have been multiple media reports about Donald's business dealings with the mob, with the mafia." While it’s important to note that these connections were not atypical in the real estate and casino businesses in the 1980s, Cruz’s statement is accurate. Media reports have linked Trump to mafia bosses and mob-connected business associates for decades. We rate the claim True.

pomt-09808	"It’s a plan that incorporates ideas from many of the people in this room tonight – Democrats and Republicans."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/09/barack-obama/Obama-says-health-plan-incorporates-ideas-of-Democ/	In his address on health care to a joint session of Congress on Sept. 9, 2009, President Barack Obama suggested the health care bills in Congress are a bipartisan collaboration. "It’s a plan that incorporates ideas from many of the people in this room tonight — Democrats and Republicans," Obama said. Earlier in the day, in a conference call with the media, Obama's deputy communications director, Dan Pfeiffer, argued that while the health bills in the House and Senate have not gotten Republican votes, the process was bipartisan because dozens of Republican amendments were adopted. And that's technically true. But it's a stretch to characterize it as bipartisan. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions adopted 159 amendments offered by Republicans, but only two of them were significant or controversial enough to merit roll call votes. One of those two affected the manufacture of biologics medication and another required members of Congress and congressional staff to enroll in the government-run option. Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, said 132 of the 159 were for "technical amendments" and that it was a misnomer to call them proof of bipartisanship. None of the Republicans' priorities have gotten any traction, he said: Tort reform, equalizing the tax code, reducing the proposed cuts to Medicare spending, and scrapping the proposed "public option." In fact, he said, only one big-picture Republican issue seems to have gotten the attention of the Democratic majority: creating incentives for wellness, such as cutting insurance costs for people who exercise or don't smoke. Over in the House, several versions of health care bills have passed various committees. Here's how Republican amendments fared there: In the Energy and Commerce Committee, 16 Republican amendments were adopted. With the exception of one that would create a pathway for nonpioneer drug companies to manufacture "follow-on" biologics, said Lisa Miller, a spokeswoman for Republicans on the committee, none of the Republican amendments could be considered major, and none change the core of the legislation. "The process in our committee was bipartisan only in that we were given the opportunity to mark up the bill," said Miller. "In large measure, the bipartisanship that existed during the E&C markup was that of luck and circumstance, not intent among Democrats." In the Education and Labor Committee, just six of the 17 amendments offered by Republicans were adopted. Several "probably are best described as technical," said Alexa Marrero, a spokesman for Republicans on the committee. And one, which sought to have members of Congress be enrolled in any government-run plan that would be created, was defeated by Democrats in other committees. One, from Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., would allow employers who would have to cut jobs to meet health coverage costs the opportunity to seek a waiver from the bill’s requirements. It was adopted by voice vote. In the House Ways and Means committee markup, all 38 of the Republican-sponsored amendments were rejected along a party-line vote. To see a more detailed accounting of some of the Republican amendments that have been considered, click on some of the links in our list of sources. But suffice to say, we didn't come across many that passed that seem significant. Michael Steel, spokesman for House Republican Leader John Boehner, said that while it's true that some Republican or bipartisan amendments were accepted, the legislation itself has received zero Republican votes. "No amendments have changed the core of the legislation" or altered the public option, Steel said. Back when the House Education and Labor Committee considered its version of the bill in mid July, several Republican legislators complained that there was little real effort to engage a bipartisan process, and they called on Democrats to scrap the plan and start over. According to an article in Congressional Quarterly , the panel’s chairman, George Miller, D-Calif., said that Republicans and Democrats simply have a "serious difference in opinion on how to approach health care in this country." We also note that after Obama's appeal to the joint session of Congress, the man designated to offer Republican rebuttal, U.S. Rep. Charles Boustany, R-La., again called on Obama and Congress to "start over on a common-sense, bipartisan plan focused on lowering the cost of health care while improving quality." When Obama said the health plan incorporated ideas from Democrats and Republicans, we think he grossly overstated the bipartisanship of the process to date. Both sides claim the other party is to blame for that, an issue that we will not wade into here. However, we note that none of the plans that have graduated from congressional committees have received a single Republican vote. Yes, Congress adopted dozens of the amendments proposed by Republicans, but we couldn't find any that dramatically altered the plan. Still, to the extent there were at least some, we give Obama's statement a Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00319	Says Tennessee Senate candidate Phil Bredesen "supports single-payer health care."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/sep/20/senate-leadership-fund/gop-super-pac-wrongly-says-democrat-bredesen-suppo/	In Tennessee’s U.S. Senate race, Democrat Phil Bredesen presents himself as a centrist candidate who just wants to fix problems. The Senate Leadership Fund aimed to change that image with an ad that casts him as a radical leftist when it comes to health care. The Republican super PAC, built by allies of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is spending $1.2 million on a television ad that opens with the bold headline: "Bredesen supports single-payer health care." "Phil Bredesen is on record supporting single-payer health care," a woman’s voice says. "He even wrote a book pushing socialized medicine." The ad pops the cover of Bredesen’s 2010 book Fresh Medicine. Bredesen made a small fortune as a health care executive. He was an early critic of Obamacare but now says he does not want to repeal the law. Single-payer health care didn’t seem quite like his style, so we cracked open his book and took a look at the ad’s claims. Key takeaways In 2010, Bredesen had a plan that would give every American a voucher that they could use to buy basic health coverage –– not from a traditional insurance company but from newly created "systems of care." The money for the vouchers would come from a payroll tax of about 20 percent. Providers would redeem the voucher money from the government, but the government would not be paying claims as it does under Medicaid and Medicare. Bredesen today says he opposes single-payer health care. Super PAC makes its case The Senate Leadership Fund draws heavily from Bredesen’s 2010 interview on C-SPAN about Fresh Medicine. "Single-payer, the federal government collecting the money and then turning it over, I mean that’s what I think actually we should do," Bredesen said Oct. 20, 2010. "Single-payer in the sense of Medicare, where government is collecting the money and then is paying all the claims, I think would be a disastrous direction for the country." In that one answer, Bredesen used the term single-payer two different ways, and had totally opposite takes on each. In another of the super PAC’s examples, Bredesen redefined Medicare for All, a popular shorthand for single-payer care. "What I was proposing was really a two-piece thing," Bredesen told Governing magazine in 2010. "It's Medicare for All, but give people a voucher and limit the amount of it. I don't think you can solve it by leaving it as an open-ended entitlement." Bredesen’s proposal went way beyond vouchers, but the idea of vouchers for Medicare, often called premium-support, is something most Democrats have pilloried, and some Republicans, such as House Speaker Paul Ryan, have supported. Not your grandfather’s Medicare for All There is a bill in Congress by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., to create a Medicare for All program. It would provide soup-to-nuts care for everything that is "medically necessary." From family doctors, to prescription drugs, to long-term care, Medicare for All would cover it. Importantly, every American of any age would be eligible and the government would pay doctors, hospitals and every other type of provider. That means no vouchers. As the advocacy group Physicians for a National Health Program put it, "single-payer national health insurance, also known as ‘Medicare for All,’ is a system in which a single public or quasi-public agency organizes health care financing, but the delivery of care remains largely in private hands." Bredesen’s proposal would cover every American, and government would play a huge role in defining what is and isn’t covered. But after that, his approach takes a different path. In his 2010 book, Bredesen envisioned a country filled with large multi-faceted provider networks he calls "systems of care." "What I mean specifically by this phrase is a formal organization that receives a determined payment for each of its patients, takes responsibility for the delivery, quality, coordination and payment for health care for for those who belong to it, and which competes with other systems of care in its geographic area for the business of citizens," Bredesen wrote. So the government would determine how much a standard basket of care would cost, give everyone a voucher for that amount and let them pick the network they liked best. The network would know that the voucher is all it would get for each person. If people wanted more, they could buy it from their own pocket. Employer-sponsored health insurance would be gone, and in large measure, so would insurance companies. The money for the vouchers would come from payroll taxes, which would be high, but less than the premiums people pay today, Bredesen argued. This table summarizes some of the key similarities and differences between Medicare for All and Bredesen’s plan: Everyone covered Basic package of care Voucher Government pays providers Medicare for All Yes Yes No Yes Bredesen Yes Yes Yes No "Single-payer implies that there is one entity such as the federal government that collects funds and pays for health care," said RAND health economist Christine Eibner. "The voucher system described –– which involves multiple competing payers –– wouldn’t fit into that category." Health policy professor Paul Ginsburg at the University of Southern California also said that today’s single-payer label wouldn’t apply. Ginsburg does see some key similarities between Bredesen’s idea and today’s Medicare Advantage program. With Medicare Advantage, a person over 65 picks a private plan and pays premiums, with some additional payments coming from Washington. "Large delivery systems are partnering with insurers to offer Medicare Advantage plans with networks built around the system," Ginsburg said. Eibner told us that while Bredesen’s approach doesn’t fit with the popular understanding of single-payer plans, the term is not precisely defined. Bredesen today vs. 2010 Bredesen’s vision for a future health care system built on organizations that don’t yet exist comes from a book he wrote eight years ago. Where he stands today is less clear. At a June 20, 2018, campaign event in Tennessee, he said he was "not for single-payer, particularly." His campaign website gives no details of his plan, although it does offer a link to Fresh Medicine. We asked his campaign if he had a policy paper on health care and heard that he does not. Our ruling The Senate Leadership Fund said Bredesen supports a single-payer plan. Bredesen used those words in a 2010 book interview, but in the same breath, he said a single-payer plan would be disastrous. Health policy researchers find telling differences between Bredesen’s ideas and single-payer plans as they are proposed today. Most important, Bredesen proposed a voucher system and the government would not pay provider claims. By that yardstick, they said his proposal does not fit the single-payer category. Plus, Bredesen said recently that he is not for a single-payer plan. The ad obscures some very important details and misleads voters on Bredesen’s stance. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-01783	"We have a 40 to 50 percent dropout rate in our inner-city schools."	false	/texas/statements/2014/jul/27/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-incorrectly-says-texas-has-40-percent-/	Houston state Sen. Dan Patrick, the Republican lieutenant governor nominee, vowed to reach out to all Texans in his general-election campaign. Addressing his party’s June 2014 state convention, Patrick continued: "I’m going to go into Democratic strongholds and I’m going to tell them about school choice and educational opportunities, because we have a 40 to 50 percent dropout rate in our inner-city schools, and that cannot stand, for those families and for our state." We wondered about those proclaimed dropout rates. The numbers from Patrick, who chairs the Senate Education Committee, contrast sharply with those cited by the the Texas Education Agency, which reported a statewide high school dropout rate for the class of 2012 of 6.3 percent. (Austin’s high schools averaged a 3.7 percent dropout rate, topping out at LBJ High School’s 8.4 percent rate, according to the agency.) The state said nearly 88 percent of more than 316,000 seniors graduated in 2012, with another 5 percent staying in high school and 1 percent receiving GED certificates. Patrick’s back-up information Asked how Patrick reached his percentages, Patrick’s campaign manager, Logan Spence, said by email Patrick looked at graduation rates for selected high schools in the Houston, Dallas and Fort Worth school districts. Spence listed 11 high schools in those districts that he described as having graduation rates ranging from nearly 60 percent down to 47 percent, implying dropout rates of more than 40 percent to 53 percent. Spence said Patrick’s numbers were based on raw data for the class of 2012 posted on TEA web pages for each school. Spence also suggested we contact Caroline Neary of the Houston-based Children at Risk Institute; she told us the group was the source of the graduation rates that Patrick used. Neary said the institute, which describes itself as a non-partisan research and advocacy organization dedicated to addressing the root causes of poor public policies affecting children, works from state data to calculate school graduation rates in part by choosing not to believe some of the reasons schools use to account for students leaving before graduation. Like the TEA, Children at Risk acknowledges students who have died or left for home-schooling and doesn’t count any of them as dropouts. The institute’s president, Bob Sanborn, told us it also credits a school with a graduate even if a student transfers to another Texas public school sometime before graduating. But unlike the state, the institute doesn’t assume students recorded by schools as leaving for private school or moving to a school in another state or country actually did so, instead considering such students all to be dropouts, Sanborn confirmed. Summing up: By Patrick’s approach, the dropout rates for his subset of 11 inner-city schools ranged from nearly 41 percent to 53 percent. By the accepted state and federal gauge, the rates ranged from 5 percent to 27 percent. We took a close look at Patrick’s dropout methodology. Snapshot: Lee High School, Houston To take one school as an example, we spoke with Houston school spokeswoman Sheleah Reed about the graduation rate result indicated by Patrick for students at the district’s Lee High. The school’s TEA profile page says the 2008-09 school year started with 608 "brand new ninth graders. If you had visited our school in May 2012, you would want to see 608 students wearing caps and gowns, right?" But students moved in and out of the school over the years, the profile says, leaving a net 531 students who "you would expect" to be 2012 graduates. Still, only 272 students received diplomas, the profile says. At a glance, this suggests a graduation rate of 51 percent, though not acknowledging students leaving or coming to the school over the four years yields a 45 percent graduation rate, a result based on dividing the 272 graduates by the 608 students in ninth grade four years earlier. This is close to the 47 percent graduation rate for Lee High presented by Patrick’s camp. Then again, drawing on the "leaver" codes employed by high schools, the state profile for Lee accounts for nearly all the students who didn’t graduate, stating that fewer than five students earned GEDs while 35 students remained at the school longer. Others were marked as returning to home countries (69 students); enrolling out of state (55) or in private school (41); or shifting to home schooling (less than 20). Also, 40 students dropped out or couldn’t be tracked, according to the profile. Asked for comment, a spokeswoman for the Houston school district, Sheleah Reed, suggested it’s an error not to adjust for students who have left and entered a school over four years or not to consider the students enrolled for another year. By email, Reed noted that by the metric accepted by the state (the longitudinal definition we covered above), Lee High had an 80 percent graduation rate. We confirmed that figure from a state chart posted online, which further indicated Lee’s class of 2012 had a 9.4 percent dropout rate. Source: Texas Education Agency, search of website starting here, July 2, 2014. Other analysts For outside expertise, we reached out to Grover J. "Russ" Whitehurst, a Brookings Institution senior fellow and former U.S. Department of Education official. Whitehurst, testifying in December 2012 on behalf of the state in a lawsuit over its school funding system, expressed concern that high schools could game the dropout reporting system. He said what commonly happens is a student drops out but is instead listed as having moved or transferred when his classmates and even school administrators know the truth. Still, Whitehurst, by email to us, called Patrick’s calculations idiosyncratic, hence generating the problems noted by the Houston district. Also, at our request, Lori Taylor, an associate professor in Texas A&M’s Bush School of Government and Public Service, explored how Patrick reached his graduation/dropout rate result for Lee High. Taylor, a member of the Children at Risk Institute’s Public Policy Advisory Board, then replied that any calculation getting to the graduation rates cited by Patrick for Lee and three other high schools he singled out as "bogus," she said by email, for ignoring certain students each school recorded as having left for other reasons. Taylor went on to say she didn’t see a way Patrick’s figures could be accurate. Responses from Patrick, institute We shared Taylor’s analysis with Neary and Spence, who emailed: "Dan doesn't use the state definition of ‘dropout’ because it doesn't accurately reflect the significant number of students who are leaving our schools before graduating." Neary said by email she could understand Taylor’s reasoning, adding: "Of course we know that every student who moves from public school to private school (or another state, or their home country) isn’t actually a dropout, even though our model does assume this. Since there is no way to independently verify leaver codes," meaning how the schools account for each student who leaves, "it is all or nothing in using them. We choose to use this more conservative estimate as a counterpoint to the state’s rates. We don’t claim to have a perfect calculation for exact graduation rates, but we are transparent in our method." Sanborn said by phone the institute's calculations are "the closest to the truth you’re going to get." Our ruling Patrick said: "We have a 40 to 50 percent dropout rate in our inner-city schools." Asked to back up his statement, Patrick failed to account for all the state’s inner-city high schools and the handful of schools he singled out had official 2012 dropout rates of 5 percent to 27 percent, far short of 40 percent or more. His proclaimed figures depend on assuming schools hide dropouts by misrepresenting them as leaving for private school or for schooling outside Texas. We rate this claim as False.

pomt-15337	Says President Obama "is reducing our naval fleet to 1917 levels..."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2015/jul/13/ew-jackson/ew-jackson-says-obama-cutting-naval-fleet-1917-lev/	E.W. Jackson, a minister who was the Virginia GOP’s nominee for lieutenant governor in 2013, says President Barack Obama is trying to sink the Navy. "(Obama) is reducing our naval fleet to 1917 levels, while China establishes naval hegemony over the Pacific," Jackson wrote in an Independence Day email announcing the formation of a veterans group seeking better treatment of active and former service members. We wondered whether Obama really is cutting the fleet to a level not seen since the U.S. entered World War I. Jackson backed his claim by sending us a 2012 PolitiFact National article detailing a downward trend in the fleet’s size and a 2014 op-ed in The Hill by two former Navy officers. Jackson is hardly the first politician to criticize the nation’s military readiness by comparing today’s fleet size with that of about 100 years ago. He joins company that includes Mitt Romney, the GOP presidential nominee in 2012; Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a current presidential candidate; and Leon Panetta, Obama’s secretary of defense from 2011-2013. The comparisons usually start in the final years before the United States’ 1917 entry into World War I. In 1915, the U.S. had 231 active ships, according to Navy figures. That rose to 245 ships by December 1916. The fleet rapidly grew in 1917, the year Jackson cited. That April 6, the date the United States formally entered the war, the Navy had 342 active ships. The Navy offers no other figure for 1917. Last year, the Navy had 289 active ships, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service. That’s four more ships than Obama inherited when he became president in 2009. So available statistics show it would be impossible for Obama to reduce the Navy to 1917 levels because the fleet, in raw numbers, was already below that level when Obama took office. We also examined Jackson’s statement using the December 1916 data, when the Navy had 245 active ships. Is Obama taking the Navy down to that level? There’s two ways to read the numbers. For several years, the White House has embraced a long-term plan that would elevate the Navy to 300 active ships in 2019 and keep it at or above that level through 2045. But any hope of achieving that depends on repealing sequestration -- a bipartisan agreement between Congress and Obama to slice debt by $1 trillion over nine years, with half of the savings coming from defense and half from domestic programs. The automatic cuts began in early 2013 after Democrats and Republicans failed to agree on any other way to pare debt. Adm. Jon Greenert said two years ago that sequestration, if not repealed, could force the Navy to trim its fleet to 255 or 260 active ships by 2020. That would be the lowest number since the end of 1916. Greenert, the chief of Naval operations, said during Senate testimony earlier this year that the Navy would do its best to shield ship building and restoration from sequestration by trying to find savings from other parts of its budget. He said the 255-ship figure was no longer valid, but didn’t provide an updated figure. There’s a final matter to consider in Jackson’s claim. Even if the number of ships is cut to a pre-World War I quantity, would that mean, as Jackson wrote, that Navy fleet has been reduced to almost a 100-year low point in readiness and capability? Many military analysts answer with a resounding no, saying those who utter such claims confuse quantity with quality. "Now, our fleet has nuclear-powered supercarriers and nuclear-powered attack submarines," said Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. "The capabilities of the ships we have today, you can’t even compare that to the ships we had in 1917." Alex Roland, a military history professor at Duke University, offered a similar take to PolitiFact National last year during a fact check on comments made by Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. "One of the reasons for the decrease in size -- both Army and Navy -- is that we now rely far more on technology than on sheer numbers," Roland said. "The question is not how we compare to our army in 1940 or our Navy in 1915, but how we compare with our potential enemies in 2014. We are head and shoulders above them." The bottom line, analysts have told PolitiFact time and again over the years, is that historic military numbers are not a good gauge of present-day strength. Our ruling Jackson says Obama "is reducing our naval fleet to 1917 levels." Even if we give Jackson a break and start his comparison at the end of 1916 -- prior to the U.S. entry into World War I -- his statement has significant problems. No doubt, our military is facing cuts from sequestration and, if the automatic reductions for defense and domestic programs continue, the Navy has said its number of active ships could fall to pre-World War I levels. But this has not been a solo act by the president. Sequestration is the consequence of a bipartisan deal between Congress and the White House who, otherwise, haven’t agreed on a plan to reduce debt. And counting the historic size of the fleet, analysts tell us, is a flawed way to assess Naval might. What chance would you give the dreadnoughts of the early 20th century against today’s nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and submarines? We rate Jackson’s statement Mostly False.	None	E.W.

pomt-04114	The fiscal cliff deal "ultimately raised taxes."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/jan/11/tom-price/fiscal-cliff-impact-taxes-matter-perspective/	Even before the smoke cleared from the new year’s fiscal cliff battle, politicos were at it again. They couldn’t agree whether the deal hiked taxes or cut them. Erstwhile allies contradicted each other. Tax nemesis Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, tweeted that it was a tax cut. Members of Congress who signed his group’s pledge to never raise taxes kept their promises, he said. U.S. Rep. Tom Price, a Roswell Republican and a fiscal hawk, came away with the opposite impression. "My assessment was that it ultimately raised taxes and didn’t decrease any spending. In fact, it increased spending," Price said during a Jan. 2 interview on WMAL-FM, a Washington-area radio station. So which one is it? A tax increase or a tax cut? We waded chin-deep into the swampy depths of federal budget making to find out. We’ll tackle whether the deal is a spending cut or an increase in a separate story. A spokesman for Price said that the congressman was referring to a variety of provisions that change taxes for individuals and businesses, such as the switch in marginal tax rates for those who make more than $400,00 a year and alterations to estate and investment tax rules. But this is only part of the story. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office issues independent analyses of legislation to help lawmakers gauge its impact on the federal government’s coffers. It found that the fiscal cliff deal, otherwise known as the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, will actually cut the money the federal government raises through taxes by $3.6 trillion through 2022. This means that by its reckoning, the deal is a tax cut. How can taxes rise and fall at the same time? It’s a matter of perspective, experts told us. The fiscal cliff was a legislative package of painful tax increases and spending cuts set to begin if Congress failed to take action on the budget by midnight Jan. 1. The lawmakers who designed it thought the measures would be so draconian that Congress would have to act before then. It wasn’t, and the country fell off the cliff. But something about staring into the fiscal abyss stirred the House of Representatives into action. A deal passed hours into the new year. If it had failed to act, the old law would have placed projected tax revenue at $44 trillion through 2022, according to the CBO. But under the new deal, revenue would equal $40.4 trillion -- hence the $3.6 trillion tax cut But there’s another way of assessing whether new tax legislation is a cut or increase: comparing the revenue to the taxes we used to pay in 2012. From this perspective, they’re up. In August, the CBO released tax revenue projections based on an "alternative fiscal scenario" where taxes through 2022 would stay much the same as they were in 2012. Its analysts found that receipts would have totaled $38.9 trillion. Under terms of the last-minute deal, they’re some $1.4 trillion higher. Both of these perspectives, or "baselines," have their strengths and weaknesses. Budget analysts use the first method because it keeps them from having to guess what future law will be. But the latter comparison can give more perspective on the law’s impact on consumer spending. "When politicians talk about this, either analysis is legitimate," said Howard Gleckman, an Urban Institute expert. The trick is to make sure you don’t mix up your baselines. If you’re comparing current taxes with the ones we paid in 2012, use it for spending as well to avoid an apples-to-oranges comparison. (Price runs into trouble on this front. We’ll address this in a future PolitiFact.) This brings us to the unsatisfying conclusion that Price is right and wrong. The fiscal cliff deal raises taxes compared with prior policy, but it lowered them compared with prior law. Or, in other words, if Congress kept the 2012 law, our taxes would be higher than they are now. But if our taxes stayed at 2012 levels, they’d be lower. This means Price’s statement that the fiscal cliff deal "ultimately raised taxes" is Half True. It is accurate but leaves out important details.

pomt-10147	"As mayor, every year I was in office I did reduce taxes."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/03/sarah-palin/property-taxes-rates-went-down-sales-tax-up/	In the vice presidential debate on Oct. 2, 2008, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin reached back to her tenure as mayor of a small Alaska town to make a point that she has some history as a tax cutter. "I’m going to talk straight to the American people and let them know my track record also," Palin said. "As mayor, every year I was in office I did reduce taxes. I eliminated personal property taxes and eliminated small business inventory taxes and as governor we suspended our state fuel tax. We did all of those things knowing that that is how our economy would be heated up." We’re going to focus here on the claims Palin makes about her record as mayor of Wasilla, Alaska, from 1996 to 2002. During that time, Wasilla’s property tax rate did inch down year after year, from 2 mills to 0.5 mills. But did taxes actually go down? That depends on how you define taxes. The overall amount of taxes collected increased by 25 percent under Palin. According to a review of Wasilla's financial reports, the amount of revenue taken in during 1996 was $6,070,806 and rose to $8,710,166 in 2002. That’s a 43 percent increase (25 percent when adjusted for inflation). So how is it possible to lower the property tax rate but take in more in taxes? The simple answer is sales tax. The sales tax is overwhelmingly the chief source of revenue in Wasilla. In 2002, the sales tax brought in nearly $6-million, compared to $343,000 from property taxes. And according to a city analysis, the amount of money brought in by the sales tax increased each year, by a total of about 50 percent between 1997 and 2002. That's a testament to economic growth in Wasilla, said current Mayor Diane M. Keller. In fact, under Keller, property taxes were later eliminated. The increased sales tax revenues allowed Palin to cut the property tax rate each year at the same time spending increased. The operating budget for Wasilla went from $6,050,160 in fiscal year 1996 to $9,393,768 in 2002, according to figures provided by the city. That’s a 55 percent increase (35 percent when adjusted for inflation). While the property tax rate decreased on Palin's watch, the sales tax rate increased from 2 percent to 2.5 percent. The increase was approved by voter referendum to pay for construction of a multiuse sports complex. Due to the economic growth in the community, Keller said, Wasilla is going to be able to stop charging that extra 0.5 percent sales tax two years earlier than anticipated. Under Palin’s mayorship, the city also took on an additional $23.7-million in long-term debt to finance the sports complex as well as for street and water projects. According to Keller, much of the additional spending under Palin was due to the growth of the city during those six years, both economically and in increased population. Palin is right when she says personal property tax and business inventory taxes were eliminated. But those cuts were mostly offset by an increase in a vehicle tax enacted by Matanuska-Susitna Borough — the equivalent of a county in many states — where Wasilla is located. A portion of the vehicle tax is distributed to Wasilla. According to a Dec. 24, 1997, article in the Anchorage Daily News , the elimination of Wasilla's personal property tax and business inventory taxes amounted to a revenue loss of about $93,000 a year. The borough's vehicle tax increase brought Wasilla an additional $70,000 a year. Palin can rightly claim that the property tax rate decreased when she was mayor. But she fails to note that while property tax rates went down, sales tax revenues went up. Some may not consider that a tax increase. But in addition to more revenue from increased economic activity, the sales tax rate also was increased. That increase was tied to funding a new sports complex, and was passed by referendum, but it’s still an additional tax. And so we find Palin's statement Half True.

pomt-09408	"Americans who get their insurance through the workplace, cost savings could be as much as $3,000 less per employee than if we do nothing."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/19/barack-obama/obama-says-health-reform-legislation-could-reduce-/	As the health care reform legislation heads toward a final vote, President Barack Obama has been out stumping hard for the plan, promising that if it passes, insurance premiums for most people will go down, at least compared to where they would be if the bill doesn't pass. "Americans who get their insurance through the workplace, cost savings could be as much as $3,000 less per employer than if we do nothing," Obama said in a health reform speech at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., on March 19, 2010. "Now, think about that. That’s $3,000 your employer doesn’t have to pay, which means maybe she can afford to give you a raise." We couldn't help but notice that this statistic is at odds with the forecast from the government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that Obama has been so fond of citing in the health care debate. But the CBO is not where the president got his number. Rather, the White House told us he got this statistic from a November report commissioned by the Business Roundtable, an association of CEOs from some of the country's leading companies. The report, prepared by Hewitt Associates, a global human resources outsourcing and consulting company, states, "We estimate that if enacted properly, the right legislative reforms could potentially reduce that trend line by more than $3,000 per employee, to $25,435." As a baseline for its analysis, Hewitt assumed that if the government does nothing, health care costs will continue to rise at the same pace they have over the last decade -- just over 10 percent a year. By that measure, health care expenses for companies would rise 166 percent by 2019, a rate they conclude is "not sustainable." The report is not a line-by-line analysis of the bill now being considered by the House, but rather looks at reforms in a broader context, said MacKenzie Lucas, a spokeswoman for Hewitt. Nevertheless, the report did consider the legislation in play at the time, most of which remains in the bill now being considered, and concluded it "provides opportunities for real savings." Among the promising ideas included in the legislation, the report stated, are "proposed delivery system reforms such as value-based purchasing, Innovation Centers to experiment with alternative methods of provider reimbursement, accountable care organizations, payment bundling, and financial penalties for avoidable hospital readmissions." The report estimates these and other reforms "could potentially reduce the rate of future health care cost increases by 15% to 20% when fully phased in by 2019." The report includes this caution, however: "This assumes the government implements the initiatives quickly, accurately, and consistently, and that private payers follow by implementing similar measures in a disciplined and timely way." So that's the Hewitt report. But what about the report from the oft-cited Congressional Budget Office? In November, the CBO estimated that for the four out of five Americans who would get their insurance through their employer, the effect on premiums would be modest. Specifically, the CBO found that for people in the small group market, employers with 50 or fewer workers, the change in premiums would range from an increase of 1 percent to a decrease of 2 percent in 2016. In the large group market, premiums are projected to be zero to 3 percent lower in 2016 (relative to current law). That shakes out to a reduction of about $100 a year, at best, for single policies. So how do we get from the CBO's projected reduction of maybe $100 to Hewitt's $3,000? While Hewitt tried to quantify the long-term effects of some of the cost-saving pilot projects being tried in the health reform bill, and assumed their potential if they were fully implemented industry-wide, the CBO shied away from forecasting the effect of such programs. The CBO report states: "The analysis does not incorporate potential effects of the proposal on the level or growth rate of spending for health care ... from the development and dissemination of less costly ways to deliver care that would be encouraged by the proposal. The impact of such 'spillover' effects on health care spending and health insurance premiums is difficult to quantify precisely, but the effect on premiums in 2016 would probably be small." But that doesn't mean those provisions should be dismissed, said Len Nichols, director of the Center for Health Policy Research an Ethics and George Mason University. While the CBO lacked the necessary proof to forecast the effects of programs that have never happened before, the potential savings from reorganizing the health care system are significant, he said. Assuming those changes occur, the $3,000 figure cited by Obama is a "pretty reasonable projection," Nichols said. Just don't expect those changes to affect your premiums any time soon. Some of them may be 10 to 20 years down the road, he said. "But if it's going to take 17 years, we need to start this afternoon," Nichols said. "Either we realign the incentives, or we suffer the fate." A couple qualifiers are in order here. First, none of the forecasts suggests premiums will be going down. Rather, the Hewitt report talks about premiums going up dramatically over the next decade, just not as much as if proper reforms are instituted. And the report is talking about long-term effects. The CBO doesn't think people getting insurance through an employer will see much change in premiums either way by 2016. And while the Hewitt report suggests significant reductions in health care costs could be achieved through meaningful health care reform, it doesn't say specifically that that is the case with the plan now before the House. And it provides lots of warnings about how things could go awry. In short, Obama is citing a very speculative report that doesn't speak directly to the legislation at hand. And it's a report that speaks to potential effects many years in the future. For more near-term effects, we think the CBO report is more definitive. But the Hewitt report does track a number of the provisions that were in the Senate plan in November, most of which are in the plan now before the House. We rate Obama's claim Half True.

pomt-04108	Says "how much money the government is collecting from people...in terms of the gross domestic product" is "the lowest in 40, 50 years."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/jan/13/bill-pascrell/rep-bill-pascrell-says-federal-revenues-share-econ/	The day before voting in favor of raising taxes on higher-income Americans as part of a deal averting the so-called "fiscal cliff," one North Jersey congressman argued that the amount of dollars reaching federal coffers has reached a historic low. As the nation braced for a series of automatic spending cuts and tax increases, Rep. Bill Pascell (D-9th Dist.) claimed in a Dec. 31 radio interview that, as a share of the economy, federal revenues are at their lowest level in up to a half century. "How much money the government is collecting from people...in terms of the gross domestic product" is "the lowest in 40, 50 years," Pascrell said on WOR-AM. It’s actually been even longer than Pascrell claimed. As a share of the gross domestic product, or GDP, federal revenues in recent years have been at their lowest level in roughly 60 years, according to data from U.S. Department of the Treasury and the White House’s Office of Management and Budget. In fiscal year 2012, which ended in September, federal revenues were 15.7 percent of GDP, slightly higher than the 15.4 percent in fiscal year 2011 and the 15.1 percent in both fiscal years 2009 and 2010. The last time when federal revenues were lower than those amounts occurred in fiscal year 1950, when revenues were 14.4 percent of GDP. Between fiscal years 1951 and 2008, the ratio of federal revenues to GDP ranged from 16.1 percent to 20.6 percent. Alan Auerbach, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told us the lower ratio in recent years is due, in part, to the fact that incomes and thus tax collections dropped during the recession. Another contributing factor is the tax cuts provided over the last decade, including the lower income tax rates first approved by President George W. Bush, according to Auerbach. "Taxes as a share of GDP tend to be ‘procyclical,’ meaning that the tax/GDP ratio rises during expansions and falls during recessions," Auerbach said in an e-mail. "That’s due to the progressivity of the income tax (increases in income are taxed at higher rates) and the volatility of corporate profits." "In addition to the Bush tax cuts, which also reduced revenues, we had measures adopted during the recession, notably the payroll tax cut that just expired," Auerbach added. In response to our findings, Pascrell spokesman Thomas Pietrykoski said in an e-mail: "What is clear as day is that the Bush Tax cuts took a hatchet to government revenue, significantly contributing to our current debt problems. Congressman Pascrell is supportive of a balanced approach in resolving the current fiscal situation that both cuts spending and asks the wealthiest among us to pay their fair share to reduce our deficit." Our ruling In a radio interview, Pascrell said "how much money the government is collecting from people...in terms of the gross domestic product" is "the lowest in 40, 50 years." The congressman’s point is solid, but his timing is slightly off. As a share of the economy, federal revenues in recent years have been at their lowest level in roughly 60 years. Starting in fiscal year 2009, revenues have remained below 16 percent of GDP, the lowest point since they hit 14.4 percent in fiscal year 1950. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-10461	Obama "supports hate-crimes expansion ... potentially putting churches at risk if they preach the truth about homosexuality."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/23/focus-family-action/the-first-amendment-is-still-in-effect/	A letter from the conservative group Focus on the Family Action makes a multifaceted attack on Sen. Barack Obama in an attempt to portray him as someone who would be "the most left-wing president in our nation's history." The article, written for the organization's Web site and widely circulated via chain e-mail, tries to paint Obama as bad for families, accusing him of everything from trying to further "the homosexual agenda" to being soft on the war against terrorists. Focus on the Family Action is the lobbying arm of Focus on the Family, an organization founded by evangelical Christian Dr. James Dobson. One of the claims in the article, written by Tom Minnery, senior vice president of Focus on the Family Action, states: "He (Obama) has pledged to homosexual leaders that he will sign the Employment Non-Discrimination Act ... (forcing businesses to defend themselves against discrimination lawsuits should they not hire a particular candidate who then announces he or she is homosexual or transsexual). He also supports hate-crimes expansion ... (potentially putting churches at risk if they preach the truth about homosexuality)." First off, Obama has, in fact, strongly supported the Employment Non-Discrimination Act and hate crime expansion. It's the bits that Minnery puts in parentheses that are misleading. We'll take these one at a time. The Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2007 would make it unlawful for employers to discriminate against an individual on the basis of actual or perceived sexual orientation. The law would provide employment protections to gay, lesbian and bisexual employees similar to those in the Civil Rights Act. The bill passed the House and has come to the Senate. Obama not only supports that measure, but would support expanding it to include gender identity as well, according to his campaign Web site. Focus on the Family has long been opposed to the legislation. Minnery told PolitiFact it could lead to this scenario: "Someone applies for a job and they are turned down, and later they identify themselves as a homosexual and claim that is why they weren't hired. How is an employer supposed to defend themselves against that charge? Proving a negative is nearly impossible." Particularly vulnerable are businesses that have religious people working for them, he said. Suppose, he said, that the person doing the hiring has a Bible on his or her desk and the applicant is put off by that, and claims later that the person had an agenda against homosexuals. If the new law is passed, he said, that applicant would be able to file a claim against the company. "That's a possibility here," Minnery said. Hardly, said Arthur Leonard, a professor of law at New York Law School and an expert in gay rights and discrimination based on sexual orientation. "They have to have known or thought the person was gay for there to be a discrimination claim," Leonard said. Brian Moulton, associate counsel for Human Rights Campaign, a strong proponent of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, said Minnery's hypothetical scenario is a red herring. "The burden of proof under ENDA is on the employee who has made a claim of discrimination," Moulton said. Twenty states already have these kinds of discrimination laws, he said, and there has been no run of unsubstantiated lawsuits. "If this were a real concern, we would have long ago seen this present itself," Moulton said. "The importance of the bill is that people who are losing their jobs because of their sexual orientation have no recourse. That's the real problem." Minnery's expressed concern about the expansion of hate-crime laws as "potentially putting churches at risk if they preach the truth about homosexuality" is similarly off base. An amendment co-sponsored by Obama sought to expand federal hate crime laws to include sexual orientation and gender identity. According to Minnery, that could lead to this scenario: Someone hears a sermon about the Bible teachings on homosexuality and then goes out and commits a crime against an innocent person; they claim they got the impetus from the church pulpit; and then the church gets charged with a hate crime. "It would have a chilling effect on teaching that part of the Bible that deals with homosexuality," Minnery said. Leonard, the law professor, said: "That's ridiculous." The First Amendment would protect the church against any kind of action like that, Leonard said. "No sane prosecuting attorney in the United States would go after a church due to a preacher making a sermon based on the Biblical teachings about homosexuality," Leonard said. Moulton, of Human Rights Campaign, noted that 32 states have hate crime laws that cover sexual orientation and, he said, "you aren't seeing members of the clergy being prosecuted under that state law for preaching about homosexuality." The hate crime legislation specifically notes that it will not impact anyone's First Amendment rights, including freedom of speech and religion. Is there such an instance where a church or pastor could be at risk under the law? "If you say, 'Gay people are evil and should be killed and here's a gun,' then yes," Moulton said. "But someone simply expressing what their religious tradition says about homosexuality from the pulpit, no." Although the Senate passed the expanded hate crimes legislation backed by Obama in September 2007, negotiators in the House and Senate did not include it as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, and it stalled. It's fair enough to take issue with Obama on his support of the two measures — certainly they were highly controversial and hotly debated. But Minnery's characterizations of what the bills would mean are misleading. We rule his statement False.	None	Focus on the Family Action	None	None	None	2008-04-23T00:00:00	2008-03-26	['None']

pomt-08563	"It takes as much energy to make a solar panel as it likely generates in its entire life."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2010/sep/28/jd-alexander/solar-panels-make-far-more-energy-they-require/	The Florida solar rebate debate begs for a little sunshine. The state owes Floridians $52.7 million in unpaid solar energy rebates. But lawmakers recently ignored Gov. Charlie Crist’s request to tap federal stimulus money to dent the backlog. Senate budget chief J.D. Alexander, R-Lake Wales, told a St. Petersburg Times reporter, "It takes as much energy to make a solar panel as it likely generates in its entire life. I really doubt that this is a good investment for the people of Florida." His energy payback claim caught some eyes — and ours. Steve Plice quickly e-mailed PolitiFact Florida. To the president of Tampa Bay Living Green, a nonprofit that teaches about environmental sustainability, Alexander’s claim stuck out. "Could you please check this?" he asked. "I have seen estimates for the energy payback period ranging from 18 months to 11 years. Solar panels are expected to last 20-30 years, so Mr. Alexander's claims would seem to be very wrong." As Plice suggests, this isn’t unexplored territory. For years, energy payback studies have examined how much energy it takes to manufacture, install and operate various kinds of solar panels, also referred to as photovoltaic modules or arrays. The idea is, a solar panel should capture more energy over its lifetime than it saps. Otherwise, as Alexander notes, one would hardly be a "good investment." We asked Alexander for support for his comments. He sent a link to a solar energy payback study he thought we "may find helpful." And did we ever. The study published by Energy Bulletin, an online clearinghouse of news and analysis, did, indeed, address Alexander’s claim. It mentioned the most commonly cited — and "possibly the only" — study that says the energy payback time on a solar panel may exceed its lifetime. The Energy Bulletin authors hadn’t found any published studies that reference the work, a 1996 book by Howard Odum called Environmental Accounting. They did note the popularity of Odum’s analysis on Web forums. Then they explain why Odum’s findings can be rejected. The Energy Bulletin authors, who reviewed other published work to reach wider conclusions about roof-mounted solar panel systems — a type a Florida homeowner might install — concluded the systems would generate enough electricity to cover their energy debt in two to eight years, and turn sunlight into energy for at least 25 years. So, they wrote in 2006, the systems "have a positive energy payback and are capable of contributing to a sustainable energy future." Alexander’s own link debunks his claim. But we were ready to examine other evidence, just in case. In 1975, the Florida Legislature created the Florida Solar Energy Center to research, test and certify solar systems and develop education programs. Dr. James Fenton, a professor of mechanical, materials and aerospace engineering, directs the institute at the University of Central Florida. Fenton pointed us to a study published two years later than Alexander’s that focuses on emissions from the life cycle of photovoltaic cells, and makes references to multiple energy payback studies. It explains that the life cycle of a photovoltaic system starts with mining quartz sand or metal ore, depending on the type of system, which then has to be purified and turned into silicon wafers or thin film. That takes a lot of energy, right? Sure, but only as much as is generated by solar systems in three to six years, and sometimes as little as a year or so, especially in sunnier climates, the study summarizes. The U.S. Department of Energy also weighs in on the topic, through a PV FAQs explainer piece called "What is the energy payback for PV?" produced by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. No good news for Alexander’s claim here. Instead, the FAQ says, "Based on models and real data, the idea that PV (photovoltaics) cannot pay back its energy investment is simply a myth." It concludes that for an investment of one to four years worth of energy output, rooftop systems can provide 30 years or more of clean energy. Other studies sent our way reached similar conclusions. Now, when Alexander provided us with the Energy Bulletin study, he explained in support of his claim that "the answer really depends on so many variables that are often difficult to control" such as materials used to create a solar panel, the type of solar system and where it is located. (He noted that "obviously some parts of the country get a lot more sunlight and cloud cover than others." Perhaps he forgot he’s a lawmaker in Florida, the Sunshine State.) "Given best materials and optimal conditions," he wrote, "there clearly can be energy payback in two to eight years. Given other conditions, the answer is there will not be payback. So, the real answer is it depends on many factors, which is true for all things involving green/clean technologies." Sounds reasonable, right? The only problem is that the study he points to, and others, attempt to control for those variables — and make allowances for them. That’s why the ranges are so wide: from one to four years, or from two to eight. And Alexander’s claim doesn’t contain nearly the flexibility of his followup explanation. He said: "It takes as much energy to make a solar panel as it likely generates in its entire life." By saying "as it likely generates in its entire life," Alexander suggests that he's talking about a typical example of solar panel output, not a fringe case with undefined "other conditions." Thus, our ruling. Alexander’s own evidence says his view "can be rejected," and a mainstream consumer publication call it "simply a myth." But he uses this long-debunked claim to help justify rejecting $13.9 million in federal funds for Floridians. We have no choice other than to focus a little sunlight his way and declare his Pants on Fire.	None	J.D. Alexander	None	None	None	2010-09-28T17:33:47	2010-09-16	['None']
pomt-02661	Buried in the Affordable Care Act is "a huge government bailout."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/13/charles-krauthammer/krauthammer-obamacare-has-hidden-insurance-company/	Bailout has never been a pretty word in politics or business and since the Great Recession, the stigma has only intensified. When Wall Street banks and automakers General Motors and Chrysler were awash in red ink, Washington threw them a $420 billion lifeline (of which $430 billion came back), while the Federal Reserve bought nearly $1.5 trillion worth of toxic mortgage-backed securities. Enter conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer with news of a new bailout. Krauthammer wrote in the Washington Post that "buried deep" in the Affordable Care Act is "a huge government bailout" to cover "up to 80 percent of insurance company losses." Krauthammer is talking about a couple of important pieces in the law that limit insurers’ losses in the first few years of the program. Without those protections, most insurance companies likely would have avoided the government marketplaces where people can pick a health plan. Krauthammer, who is no fan of Obamacare, supports legislation to remove those protections for health insurance providers from the law. "Without viable insurance companies doing the work, it falls apart. No bailout, no Obamacare," he wrote. We wanted to look deeper into Krauthammer’s assertion that these measures are bailouts, akin to the support offered to banks and car makers. A bridge over risky waters The Affordable Care Act does a complete number on the insurance game as Americans know it, at least in the individual and small group markets. Instead of companies making a profit through selling policies to the healthy and avoiding the ill, the law aims to pull carriers into a world where they insure everyone and compete based on efficiency and value. We’re not saying that will necessarily happen, but that’s the goal. In sickness and health and everything in between, that’s the population the insurers must work with. The problem is, if you are an insurance company, how do you decide how much to charge in such a different landscape? Until you have a few years to see who is actually in the pool and how much health care they use, the uncertainty is way beyond your comfort zone. Enter the government and a few tricks to make the risk picture more manageable. The law forces insurers to share some profits and losses across health care plans. Money shifts from companies that paid out less than average in claims to companies that paid out more than average. It’s a permanent program meant to help level the playing field. The law also protects insurers from suffering losses for providing insurance to higher cost customers -- to a point. The program is called reinsurance, and here’s how it works. The law slaps a $63 fee or tax on most policies. That pool of money, which translates to $20 billion between 2014 and 2016, helps insurers pay for claims for people who require more medical attention. The reinsurance program lasts for only three years. A third part of the law, called a risk corridor, is another temporary program meant to mitigate an insurer’s risk. It’s the program that largely drives the concern over potential bailouts. The idea behind the corridor is that the government and insurers share risk for plans offered through the government marketplaces. Like the reinsurance program, it lasts only from 2014-16. Here’s how it works. The government sets financial benchmarks for each plan offered on the marketplace. As long as insurers come close to that benchmark, nothing happens. If an insurer overperforms by up to 3 percent, they can keep the extra revenue. If they underperform by up to 3 percent, they are forced to absorb those additional costs. When the gaps get wider, however, money starts changing hands. If insurers beat their benchmark by 3-8 percent, they have to split that extra revenue with the federal government. If insurers beat the mark by more than 8 percent, the government receives 80 percent of that additional money. On the flip side, when insurers fail to meet their benchmarks the government helps absorb those costs. If insurers underperform by 3-8 percent, the government will cover half the extra cost. The government covers 80 percent of the costs after that. The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number cruncher of Congress, says all of these measures will be budget neutral. Some plans will share gains with the government and some will get checks from the government. Overall, the CBO predicts that the money going out will be matched by the money coming in. However, if the CBO is wrong, there is nothing to stop the money from flowing from the government to private insurers. There is no cap written into the law. The fear among conservatives is that ad hoc changes to the law since it passed could be creating a ripple effect where the marketplace insurance pools have more sick people and losses would rise. Hence, the concern over bailouts. The bailout dispute We asked Krauthammer why he called this a bailout and he said he relied on the definition from Merriam-Webster. "The act of saving or rescuing something (such as a business) from money problems," he quoted. "A rescue from financial distress." Rescue is clearly the operative word. We looked at other definitions. The Palgrave Dictionary of Economics spoke of a rescue from "potential or actual insolvency." Investopedia had to prevent "the consequences that arise from a business's downfall." The country’s recession bailouts fit these definitions nicely. First the private firms were in crisis and then the government stepped in with taxpayer dollars. For Scott Harrington, professor of health care management at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School, Krauthammer’s use of the word in the context of the Affordable Care Act gets the sequence wrong. "Bailouts involve ex post actions to address private sector screw-ups," Harrington said. "That's not what happened here." Although the government could end up writing some large checks, the system was not explicitly set up to do that. Companies are expected to try to make a profit, and they have yet to experience any losses. Mark A. Hall, professor of law and public health at Wake Forest University, took exception to Krauthammer’s statement because Krauthammer writes as though all the money comes from American taxpayers. "A bailout is using general taxpayer revenues to help an industry or interest group," Hall said. "Here, the funding source is mainly from insurers themselves." Mary van der Heijde, a principal and actuary with the health care consulting firm Milliman, told PunditFact that Krauthammer’s term "strikes me as an aggressive characterization." In her view, Krauthammer spoke only to the negative side of the program. "This (risk corridor) provision is applied uniformly, in that both gains and losses are shared with the government," van der Heijde said. "Not just losses." Melinda Buntin, chair of the Department of Health Policy at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, noted that this is not the first time the government has used the risk corridor approach. It was part of the launch of the Medicare Part D prescription drug program. "Under that, insurers have actually incurred higher profits than expected on average and have thus paid money back into the government," Buntin said. Our ruling Krauthammer said the Affordable Care Act contains a hidden government bailout for insurance companies that would cover up to 80 percent of their losses. The health care law does contain several mechanisms to mitigate potential losses for insurance companies, and the government stands to help absorb some losses up to 80 percent. But the government also stands to gain if insurance companies are able to turn profits, and the Congressional Budget Office has projected that the government would neither make nor lose money. Experts we spoke with also took issue with Krauthammer’s use of the term "bailout." In the past decade, bailouts came after private businesses faced a financial crisis. The measures in the Affordable Care Act have a more complicated sequence that include a variety of outcomes. This claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.

pomt-02032	Redskins is "used historically" as "a term of respect."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/04/pete-hegseth/pundit-claims-redskins-historically-used-term-resp/	In the early years of the National Football League, the owner of the Boston Redskins asked his coach to don a headdress on the sideline. The players wore war paint, and a marching band played the fight song "Hail to the Redskins," with broken English lyrics that referenced scalping. Today, the team plays in the nation’s capital, the headdress and war paint long gone. But contention over the team’s "Indian" identity has never been greater. In May, 50 U.S. senators signed a letter urging the Washington Redskins to change its name. Team owner Daniel Snyder isn’t budging, even as colleges and high schools dropped "redskin" mascots over the years and other professional teams abandoned traditions like the Atlanta Braves’ Chief Noc-A-Homa (Knock-A-Homer). Why? Dumping the brand of a storied franchise carries an obvious cost. Still, people who support the nickname offer another defense. "When’s the last time you heard someone use that as a racial slur?" asked Pete Hegseth, a guest panelist on the Fox News show Outnumbered. "It’s not used commonly at all as a racial slur. It’s used historically to refer to — a term of respect to people." In this fact-check, PunditFact will explore the roots of the word redskin, the origins of the team’s name and whether the term was meant as a show of respect. ‘The red people’ How the word formed and evolved is ripe for academic debate, with scholars probing documents, speeches, literature and news articles for its earliest mentions. Redskins team president Bruce Allen cites the work of Ives Goddard, senior linguist emeritus at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Natural History. Allen isolated a line from a 2005 academic journal article that aimed to knock down "unfounded" claims that the word refers to bloody "red skins," or dead American Indians, as proof for bounties. Goddard said the word’s origin is "entirely benign and reflects more positive aspects of relations between Indians and whites." It was not disrespectful, he told us, and originated from the French translation of a Native American idiom to designate racial differences with Europeans. The earliest verified uses of "redskins" come in the mid 18th century in colonial dealings with tribes in Illinois Country. The first recorded public use in English was when President James Madison spoke to a delegation of Indian tribes at President’s House in Washington at the onset of the War of 1812. Madison talked about "the red people who live on the same great island with the white people." Two tribal leaders referred to themselves as "redskins" in response. Goddard further traced the term to an 1815 speech by Meskwaki chief Black Thunder amid peace treaty negotiations. Addressing the governor of the Missouri Territory, Black Thunder said, "I have never injured you, and innocence can feel no fear. I turn to all, redskins and white skins, and challenge an accusation against me." The point of Goddard’s research: The term "redskins" was born as a neutral description of American Indians during a limited, positive time between colonials and some tribal nations. Hegseth went further, though, describing its use as a "a term of respect." Hollywood western culture Nancy Shoemaker, a University of Connecticut history professor who studied the etymology of "red" references to Indians, said she considers Goddard’s work thorough but wished he had tracked the word post-1826. Throughout the rest of the 19th century, she said, the term was deployed by whites in acts of violence against Native Americans. The Redskins team name "was not harking back to French-Meskwaki treaty councils," Shoemaker said. "It was harking back to 19th century use of the word." Some tribes occasionally referred to themselves as "red people," she said, such as Cherokees claiming "red" as a way to differentiate themselves from the whites "they saw as greedy and grasping." Other experts said "red men" was used to reference red body paint worn by tribes. The word’s evolution over the 19th century is not as well researched, though Shoemaker says historians find its disparaging use "kind of obvious." The term carried a negative connotation -- that people of darker skin were inferior -- over the past two centuries, said Sherry L. Smith, a Southern Methodist University history professor. "Pete Hegseth seems to have taken the argument that teams selected Native American sports mascots as a sign of respect for ‘Indians’ and shifted that over to the use of the word ‘redskins’ as a sign of respect," Smith said. "He is simply wrong." The term came up in some 19th century literature, and experts debate whether references are sympathetic or condescending. James Fenimore Cooper used "red men" and "red-skin" throughout his 1820s novels The Pioneers and The Last of the Mohicans to describe Native Americans. To Goddard, the terms are an "affectless designation," an earnest attempt to use the more accurate term compared to "Indian." To others, Cooper is romanticizing native characters in a racist way, treating them as "living relics" doomed to extinction, said Philip J. Deloria, a University of Michigan professor of history and American culture. Clearer derogatory portrayals emerged in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The Wonderful Wizard of Oz author Frank Baum invoked the word in 1890 and 1891 newspaper editorials calling for the extermination of Native Americans. Baum wrote of Sioux leader Sitting Bull’s death in 1890 that "with his fall the nobility of the Redskin is extinguished, and what few are left are a pack of whining curs who lick the hand that smites them." 20th century depictions of war-like, primitive redskins endured in early Hollywood westerns and the 1932 Tom and Jerry cartoon "Redskin Blues," in which the title characters escape an attack on their wagon by Indians (some, for example, appear chubby but are revealed to be Indian women in skimpy dress) thanks to the U.S. military. The "Indian" caricature persisted as American Indians were pushed onto reservations and dealt with a law that banned outward practice of their religions. Experts we consulted were hard-pressed to find "redskin" used in a cut-and-dried show of respect. "That's not to say one might not be able to find an instance of it someplace," Deloria said. "I’d say there's no evidence that it was a common form of discourse, widely understood as a word of value and respect." ‘Hail to the Redskins’ Despite the prevailing depictions of American Indians as "redskins" in the early 20th century, the football team says it chose its name out of respect. "It is a symbol of everything we stand for: strength, courage, pride, and respect -- the same values we know guide Native Americans and which are embedded throughout their rich history as the original Americans," Snyder, the owner, wrote in a 2013 letter to season ticket holders. The team played as the Boston Braves in its first season in 1932. Owner George Preston Marshall chose the Redskins name in 1933 with the team’s move into Fenway Park, home of the Red Sox. Marshall’s motivations remain uncertain, though it’s clear he loved to exploit Native American imagery for games. A known racist, his team was the last to integrate. Team officials have claimed throughout the ongoing legal battle over the team’s trademark that Marshall was honoring its coach, William "Lone Star" Dietz, who claimed Sioux heritage, and the early American Indian players recruited for the team. But Dietz’s heritage is another sore subject, with evidence suggesting he was a German American who assumed a Native American identity. Another theory is Marshall was likely choosing a synonym for "Braves." Indian names had already proliferated throughout sports, chosen to reference hometowns or states, express patriotism or warrior-like strength, or touch on enthusiasm for American Indian athletes like Jim Thorpe, said J. Gordon Hylton, a law professor at Marquette University and University of Virginia and a sports historian. Our ruling This fact-check isn’t about whether the Redskins owner believes his football team’s name is meant to be respectful (that’s his opinion). It’s also not about whether the Redskins name has a place in the 21st century (that’s your opinion). We’re evaluating a claim by a defender of the nickname that the word itself was used as a term of respect. It’s a stretch. Its earliest use was as a racial designation before being used in derogatory portrayals of American Indians in literature, movies and newspapers, and in 19th century clashes between whites and tribal nations. That sentiment extended into 20th century culture. Hegseth’s talking point suggests "redskins" was used as an honorific and doesn’t tell the full story about the word’s historical usage. We rate his claim Mostly False.	None	Pete Hegseth	None	None	None	2014-06-04T13:50:11	2014-05-26	['None']
pomt-01253	"Every single day in this country, 1,000 people are deported and the vast majority of those people that are deported aren't criminals."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/nov/12/jose-diaz-balart/diaz-balart-vast-majority-deportees-arent-criminal/	As part of his post-election analysis, Telemundo news anchor and MSNBC host Jose Diaz-Balart argued that the Hispanic vote remains up for grabs going forward because politicians of both parties seem uninterested in addressing Hispanics’ concerns. "Every single day in this country, 1,000 people are deported and the vast majority of those people that are deported aren't criminals," Diaz-Balart said on NBC’s Meet the Press Nov. 9, 2014. "The people that are being deported many times are family, fathers and mothers and those people don't see anyone in Washington standing up and saying, let's deal with this problem." We’ll stay out of the politics of the issue, but we were curious about Diaz-Balart’s claim that 1,000 people are deported every day and that the vast majority aren’t criminals. Deportation lingo Before we break down the numbers, it’s important to note that officials no longer use the word "deportation" to describe immigration enforcement actions. What we commonly think of as deportation can include two categories -- returns and removals. "The return process is more informal," said Marc Rosenblum, deputy director of immigration policy studies at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research group that counts among its funders the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Carnegie Corporation and the World Bank. "It generally takes place at the border and there’s no judicial order and no real penalty." Basically with a return, a person gets caught and agrees to go back home. Authorities retain a record of their entry and can use that against them if they show up again. Most returns happen right at the border. A removal is more formal. There’s nothing voluntary about it. It comes with an official order, either from a judge or one of two immigration control agencies. If the person is caught again, he or she may face criminal penalties. Based on the numbers he used, Diaz-Balart focused solely on removals in making his comments. In fact, he has talked about these exact removal stats before (without the additional note that the "vast majority" were non-criminal cases). Diaz-Balart’s claim by the numbers Representatives for Diaz-Balart said he relied on data from the Department of Homeland Security. In 2013, according to Homeland Security, more than 438,000 people were subject to removal. That is the highest number ever. Of those, 45 percent faced some kind of criminal charge; 55 percent did not. The following table, based on Homeland Security data, shows the trends during President Barack Obama’s time in office. How do those numbers match Diaz-Balart’s statement? More than 1,000 people per day, on average, have been removed from the country since Obama has been president. In 2013, an average of 1,200 people per day were removed. But non-criminals no longer make up the "vast majority" of removals and have not since 2009, as Diaz-Balart claimed. "It’s not accurate to say that the vast majority are non-criminals," Rosenblum said. "It’s a bare majority." If you include returns in the calculation (178,000 in 2013) Diaz-Balart would be correct that the vast majority are non-criminals but would have understated the daily average of returns and removals by close to 700 per day. A note about those criminals While the percentage of criminal removals is high (45 percent), there’s enough evidence to tell us this category itself should be viewed with care. Homeland Security reports that violations of immigration law represent nearly a third of the cases. Another 15 percent are criminal traffic offenses. We can’t draw a definitive line between minor and more serious offenses. But the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a big data center at Syracuse University, examined cases handled by courts — a subset of all the removal actions — and found about 90 percent of the convictions there have been for illegal entry or re-entry. (In short, these people’s crime is entering the country illegally in the first place.) Kevin Johnson, dean of the University of California-Davis School of Law, said his reading of the record tells him immigration officials define criminality quite broadly. "Throughout the Obama years, the data has shown that removals based on non-criminal or minor criminal offenses, such as driving without a license, have greatly outnumbered the removals of serious criminal offenders," Johnson said. Our ruling Diaz-Balart said that 1,000 people are deported each day and the vast majority are not criminals. Diaz-Balart is right that 1,000 people a day on average are formally removed from the country. In fact, in 2013, it was 1,200 per day. But he reached too far by saying the "vast majority" are not criminals. Strictly speaking, non-criminal removals only slightly outnumber the people removed under the cloud of a criminal charge.

pomt-10517	Obama says Clinton in 2002 suggested there was a connection between al-Qaida and the Iraqi government.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/12/barack-obama/yes-clinton-used-the-bush-administration-line/	Asked about a new report that found no connection between al-Qaida and the old Iraqi government before the U.S. invasion, Sen. Barack Obama said it shows that Sen. Hillary Clinton had poor judgment in 2002 when she repeated claims from the Bush administration to support its plan to go to war. "President Bush and Dick Cheney insisted there was a connection. Senator Clinton on the floor of the Senate suggested that there was such a connection," Obama said in an interview on MSNBC's Hardball on March 11, 2008. "I think it was part of a series of misjudgments that have not only cost us dearly in terms of lives lost and people who are injured, has distracted us from Afghanistan and our ability to pin down bin Laden and al-Qaida, but has also cost us hundreds of billions of dollars." Clinton's support of the war is well-known, but we wondered if Obama was quoting her correctly about al-Qaida. So we checked the transcript of a speech she gave on Oct. 10, 2002, just hours before the Senate voted to approve the war resolution. In that speech, Clinton explained her reasoning for supporting the war resolution. She described Saddam Hussein as "a tyrant who has tortured and killed his own people" and said that he blocked weapons inspections in 1998. "In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al-Qaida members, though there is apparently no evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of Sept. 11, 2001." In their book Her Way: The Hopes and Ambitions of Hillary Rodham Clinton, Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta Jr. note that Clinton was rare among Democrats in citing the al-Qaida link. The book quotes Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware as saying the links were "much exaggerated," while Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California described them as "tenuous." Gerth and Van Natta point out that Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut came closest to echoing Clinton's comments, but even he said "the relationship between al-Qaida and Saddam's regime is a subject of intense debate within the intelligence community." Clinton was asked to explain her al-Qaida remark during an appearance on Meet the Press on Sept. 23, 2007. She sidestepped the part about al-Qaida but said, "Well, I cast a sincere vote based on my assessment at the time, and I take responsibility for that vote. I also said on the floor that day that this was not a vote for pre-emptive war. I thought it made sense to put inspectors back in. As you recall, Saddam had driven out the U.N. inspectors in 1998 and the situation in Iraq was opaque, hard to determine, and I thought that it made sense to put inspectors back in." She put the blame on the Bush administration. "Now, obviously, if I had known then what I know now about what the president would do with the authority that was given him, I would not have voted the way that I did." Still, Obama has accurately described her statement, so we find his claim True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-03-12T00:00:00	2008-03-11	['Bill_Clinton', 'Iraq', 'Barack_Obama']

pomt-03088	"Today many Florida teachers are at risk of having their pay impacted by the performance of children who are not even in their classrooms or subject areas."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/sep/25/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-florida-teachers-risk-having-pay-aff/	Pay raises for new teachers in Florida will be partially tied to how their students perform in the classroom, but school districts are struggling to find ways to measure how a teacher affects a student’s score on a test. Using reading and math scores from the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test may make sense for reading and math teachers, but what about educators who teach electives, language and arts courses? Those subjects do not come with a standardized test. It’s a fundamental flaw in the merit-pay system, one that prompted Gov. Charlie Crist to veto the Republican-led proposal in 2010. Crist’s successor and potential 2014 opponent, Gov. Rick Scott, signed a similar bill into law in 2011. "The results were, unfortunately, as expected," Crist wrote in a Sept. 22 column in the Tampa Bay Times. "Today many Florida teachers are at risk of having their pay impacted by the performance of children who are not even in their classrooms or subject areas." We decided to see if Crist is right: Are Florida teachers "at risk of having their pay impacted by the performance of children who are not even in their classrooms or subject areas"? Under the law, teachers are evaluated based on a scoring system with categories of highly effective, effective, needs improvement and unsatisfactory. (Performance-based evaluations started in the 2011-12 school year but will not be tied to salary increases and job status until the 2014-15 school year, at least statewide.) How districts measure a teacher’s influence is basically up to them. About half of the teacher’s grade is based on student performance. For teachers who teach reading and math in grades tested by the FCAT, the assessment data was pertinent. But for the thousands of teachers who teach other subjects, such as art, music or social studies, or those grades that are not measured by FCAT, districts had to think of another way to gauge their performance. Most went with schoolwide FCAT scores, which measure reading (grades 3-10), math (grades 3-8) and science (grades 5 and 8). The decision was controversial enough that seven teachers, with the backing of the Florida Education Association, sued the state’s education commissioner and board. One plaintiff, Hernando County teacher Bethann Brooks, was evaluated based on reading test scores of freshmen and sophomores, but Brooks taught juniors and seniors health science. In the new system, Brooks’ performance fell from "highly effective" to "effective." As evidence to back up his claim, Crist sent us an April 2013 Washington Post blog post highlighting the lawsuit. But that’s not the latest news on this issue. Sen. Anitere Flores, R-Miami, tried to improve the 2011 law by inserting language in a 2013 bill that said teachers had to be evaluated on the performance their students. But the change was hardly a magic wand. It told districts what not to do, but not how to avoid it. Take Pinellas County, where the school board tried to comply with the new state law by passing a plan that greatly reduced the number of teachers evaluated based on students they did not teach. However, many teachers will continue being evaluated by student scores in subjects they do not teach. Schoolwide reading and math FCAT scores will continue to be used in evaluations for teachers in non-core subjects, such as art, music and physical education, as well as middle and high school science teachers, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Hillsborough County schools were in a better position than most, because the system developed end-of-course exams for all academic subjects including electives a few years ago because of a grant, said district spokesman Stephen Hegarty. In other words, much is still being worked out. Thanks to a $20 million federal grant, Hillsborough, Miami-Dade, Duval and Polk counties are developing assessments for "hard-to-measure" subjects that do not have statewide assessments, including physical education, performing arts, visual arts, world languages, and career and technical education. The result will be a bank of test questions for districts to use for those subjects. The goal is to have an assessment for every subject, said Department of Education spokeswoman Cheryl Etters, but it’s not ready yet. Education groups will continue to push for changes in the evaluation formula so it does not rely so much on test scores in the 2014 legislative session, said Wayne Blanton, executive director of the Florida School Boards Association. "The bottom line is the testing and assessments of teachers have not been fleshed out to the point where everyone in the education community is comfortable with it," he said. Our ruling Crist is echoing a legitimate concern of teachers, administrators, lawmakers and unions of the performance pay law. Crist neglects to mention the Legislature tried to address this in a new law that says teachers can only be evaluated by students in their classrooms. Until more assessments are prepared for more subjects, some teachers, particularly in non-core classes or in grades without assessments, will continue to be evaluated not based on the subjects they teach but on overall student scores in FCAT reading and math. Crist’s point is largely accurate given the first round of evaluations, but a new law aims to reduce the problem. We rate this Mostly True.

pomt-08746	"We have 50 state lobbyists that just lobby the Legislature for money every year."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/aug/30/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-50-state-employees-are-paid-lobby-/	Newly minted Republican nominee for governor Rick Scott is making the rounds on national television promoting his plan to cut state taxes and spending. On MSNBC's The Daily Rundown on Aug. 26, 2010 -- two days after his defeat of rival Bill McCollum -- Scott faced questions from host Chuck Todd about whether the major tax and spending cuts he has suggested are realistic given Florida's budget structure and current tax policy. Todd correctly noted that the state budget has been crafted by Republicans for the last 12 years. Todd, who grew up in Miami, then tried to get Scott to zero in on some specific program that could be cut. "It's a pretty lean and mean government, is it not?" Todd asked. "No," replied Scott. "We have a $70 billion budget. We're not going back and looking at how we spend everything. And for example, we have 50 state lobbyists that just lobby the Legislature for money every year. That's not what state governments ought to be doing." We were intrigued by Scott's specific example of government excess -- his claim about the 50 state lobbyists who "just lobby the Legislature for money every year." So we decided to check it out. Anyone who lobbies the Legislature is required to register with the state, so we started by going to the Florida Legislature's lobbyist directory. State statutes define a "lobbyist" as a "person who is employed and receives payment, or who contracts for economic consideration, for the purpose of lobbying, or a person who is principally employed for governmental affairs by another person or governmental entity to lobby on behalf of that other person or governmental entity." The same statutes define "lobbying" as "influencing or attempting to influence legislative action or nonaction through oral or written communication or an attempt to obtain the goodwill of a member or employee of the Legislature." The definitions could catch a lot of state employees who talk policy or budget with the Legislature on behalf of their agency or department. And when we searched through the 2010 registered lobbyist list, that's exactly what we found. We counted more than 200 state employees who have been registered as lobbyists by the Legislature. A few examples: The Agency for Health Care Administration has eight registered lobbyists. The Department of Children and Family has 31 registered lobbyists. The Department of Education has 10 registered lobbyists. Florida Education Commissioner Eric Smith is listed as a lobbyist, as is Florida Department of Law Enforcement Commissioner Gerald Bailey, Department of Community Affairs Secretary Tom Pelham, Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Mike Sole, and Florida Department of Transportation Secretary Stephanie Kopelousos. So is someone like Secretary of State spokeswoman Jennifer Davis and James Karels, the director of the Division of Foresty under the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. In total, the list includes way more than the 50 state employees Scott claimed on MSNBC. But as we looked at the list, many of the state employees aren't lobbyists in the traditional sense -- meaning that they only lobby the Legislature. We went to the Executive Office of the Governor -- the formal title for Gov. Charlie Crist's office -- to examine the issue in a little more detail. Crist's office includes 40 registered lobbyists, according to the directory. The list includes many employees who work in the Governor's Office of Policy and Budget, the arm of the state executive branch that crafts and reacts to policy proposals and drafts a state budget. Put simply, the governor's sausage makers. That list includes John Mitchell (environmental policy), Jasmin Raffington (transportation and economic development policy), Christian Weiss (economic analysis) and Randy Ball (public safety policy). Then there are folks like Bruce Grant of the Office of Drug Control, JoAnn Carrin of the Office of Open Government, Lucia Fishburne of the Office of Film and Entertainment, and Chris Hart of Office of Tourism, Trade, and Economic Development. And then there's Crist's executive team, which includes chief of staff Shane Strum, and deputy chiefs of staff Ken Granger, Chuck Drago and Jerry McDaniel. "Most of our staff discuss policy before legislative committees and (are) not necessarily there to lobby for money," said governor's office spokesman Sterling Ivey. Later, Ivey added that the governor's office "does not have an employee whose only job is to lobby the Legislature. Anyone lobbying or appearing before committees would have other primary job responsibilities and appearance before the legislature would be a secondary part of their job." All that information left us skeptics. On one hand, Scott's number was awfully low. And also, it seems misleading because it's labeling employees as lobbyists when they get that title more by technicality. So we turned to the Scott campaign for clarity. The campaign provided us with this spreadsheet, which wasn't really clear at all until we got a more detailed explanation. In short, the Scott campaign created a subset of those 200-plus lobbyists, specifically those whose primary or sole responsibility is to work with the Legislature. For many agencies, these positions are often called "Legislative Affairs Director" or something like that. With that information, we started doing our own research. Take, for instance, the Agency for Health Care Administration. The agency has its own Legislative Affairs Office, which "serves as the Agency resource for statutory interaction," according to the AHCA website. "It provides information to legislators and the public about health care legislation. The office also acts as liaison between AHCA staff, legislators, legislative committee staff and industry interests." The office employs three people -- Warren Moore, Jim Alfred and Ashley James -- all of them registered to lobby before the Legislature. Then we searched around the other departments and agencies in Tallahassee. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection has a legislative affairs office, which "includes developing legislation and support information, and finding sponsors for legislation. The Office also serves as the central point of contact for legislators and their staffs for information about the Department's programs," according to its website. The office is headed by Cameron Cooper, who is registered to lobby the Legislature. Grace Lovett is a registered lobbyist and the office's deputy director. The Department of Corrections has three people in its legislative affairs office -- Jason Welty, Tommy Maggitas, Kristen Manalo –- registered to lobby. Rivers H. Buford is the legislative affairs director for the Department of State. Kimberly Case is the legislative affairs director for the Attorney General's office. It turns out most agencies and departments have their own legislative point person. Jim Henry, a registered lobbyist, is the legislative affairs director for the Department of Children and Families. Sunny Phillips at the Department of Community Affairs. Two slots at the Department of Juvenile Justice -- one for Sarah Toms and a vacant director position. The Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation has a legislative director and three legislative affairs coordinators. Three of the four are registered to lobby before the Legislature. There is a director and a deputy director in the legislative affairs office of the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. The Department of Elder Affairs has a legislative affairs director. So does CFO Alex Sink's Department of Financial Services. So does the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Department of Highway Safety & Motor Vehicles has a legislative affairs administrator. The Department of Health has a legislative planning director. The Agency For Workforce Innovation also has a legislative affairs position. The Department of Management Services has a director and deputy director of legislative affairs. Both are registered to lobby. The Department of Veterans' Affairs has a Legislative, External & Cabinet Affairs Director who is registered to lobby. The Department of Education has an office of governmental relations. Its director is registered to lobby in Florida. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission has a legislative affairs office with a director and legislative liaison who are both registered to lobby. The Department of Health employs a director of legislative planning and a deputy secretary for advocacy and policy, both who are registered to lobby. The Department of Revenue has an office of Legislative and Cabinet Services. We found at least two people in the office who are registered lobbyists. The Department of the Lottery has a director of legislative affairs and a senior legislative analyst who are both registered to lobby. That's 37 people we found in a few hours searching who are registered lobbyists for state agencies and departments whose primary responsibility is dealing with the Legislature. And we admit we're likely overlooking some employees at the state department and agency level. Then there are the college and university lobbyists -- technically state employees -- who also lobby the Legislature. The University of Florida employs a director of government relations and an associate vice president of government relations. Both are registered to lobby the Legislature. The University of Central Florida has a director of governmental relations. So does the University of West Florida. The University of North Florida has a vice president for governmental relations. Even non-universities have full-time lobbyists. St. Petersburg College has a government relations director. As does Palm Beach State College. And Miami-Dade College, Valencia Community College, Daytona State College, Edison State College, Pensacola Junior College, and Seminole State College. That's another 13 people, or 50 all together, and again that most likely is just a partial list. (For the record, state law says departments and colleges "may not use public funds to retain a lobbyist to represent it before the legislative or executive branch." However, full time department and college employees "may register as lobbyists and represent that employer before the legislative or executive branch." In other words, the state lobbyist must also be a full time department or college employee). Scott's number is credible. There are at least 50 state employees whose primary responsibility is to lobby the state Legislature. But Scott also said that they "just lobby" for money. That's not true. While lobbyists will no doubt support the budget requests of their specific agency, department or university, they also spend significant time lobbying for policy, and they act as a point person for legislators looking for information about a specific program. It's more than just money, though money is a part of it. For instance, here's how the Department of State's Office of Legislative Affairs describes itself: "The office ... supervises and coordinates the Department's legislative agenda and identifies needed legislation; drafts proposed bills; identifies bill sponsors; tracks departmental legislation and other filed legislation that will potentially impact, positively or negatively, the Department's programs. This information is then used to help educate the Legislature, other state agencies, the Governor's Office and the public to understand how these proposals impact the department's legislative and budgetary goals and objectives. The unit also takes the lead with constituent issues generated by legislative offices that affect the department." Which brings us back to Scott's claim. In a national television interview, Republican gubernatorial candidate Rick Scott said that Florida has "50 state lobbyists that just lobby the Legislature for money every year." There are more than 200 state employees registered as lobbyists in Tallahassee to advocate either for policy or money. And there are at least 50 of them whose primary job is work with the Legislature. But they do more than lobby just for money as Scott suggested. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-08356	Says Scott Bruun supports allowing corporations to secretly funnel millions of dollars to front groups to finance attack ads.	half-true	/oregon/statements/2010/oct/27/jeff-merkley/jeff-merkley-accuses-scott-bruun-supporting-secret/	As anyone watching all the television ads knows, freshman U.S. Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore., faces Republican Scott Bruun in Oregon’s 5th Congressional District. In a fundraising letter on behalf of Schrader last month, U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley describes Bruun -- without naming him -- as a big-bank-loving, middle-class-hating Republican. The letter contains this line: "No wonder Kurt’s opponent has said he supports allowing corporations to secretly funnel millions of dollars to front groups to finance attack ads." Secretly funnel millions? Front groups? Attack ads? It all sounded so very Dr. Evil. PolitiFact Oregon was all over it. Bruun, in line with most other Republicans, supports the U.S. Supreme Court’s 5-4 decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (January 2010). The ruling loosened restrictions, allowing corporations and unions to spend as much money as they want directly from their treasuries to support or oppose a candidate. Before, donations had to come from employees or union members through a political action committee. Also before the ruling, corporations couldn’t spend any money on campaign ads -- the ones that urge a vote for or against a candidate -- within 60 days of a general election. In general, Democrats call the Citizens United ruling a slap to grass-roots democracy. Republicans, who get lots of contributions from corporate interests, say there should be no limits on speech. (The majority held that First Amendment protections should apply to corporations as well.) Asked for evidence that Bruun ever said such a thing, the Merkley campaign offered his response to a question about the Citizens United decision from the League of Women Voters of Oregon guide: "Free speech is messy, noisy and uncomfortable for some. Of course the alternative to free speech is much worse. Political ‘speech’ is the most important form of speech for a free, open and tolerant society. The Supreme Court has ruled and Congress should leave it alone." Nothing there about "secret" millions or "front groups." In fact, Bruun never said any such thing. But we wanted to know if the sentiment behind Merkley’s statement was accurate. In other words, is it fair to say that you favor secret donations to front groups to pay for attack ads if you think Congress should leave Citizens United alone? Citizens United expanded the amount of money allowed and how it can be used, but it was the final nail in a bout of hammering. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court started allowing corporate money into elections by letting groups, including corporations, spend money to run "issue advocacy" commercials. The decision in Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life struck down a portion of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law. And let’s not discount the roles of federal tax law and federal enforcement of elections communications in allowing donations to remain secret. First, the IRS tax code allows 501(c) nonprofit groups to shield donor names even as it allows politically minded nonprofits to engage in political speech. (To compare, political groups identified under IRS tax code 527 must disclose regularly.) Second, the FEC requires disclosure only of corporate money earmarked for "electioneering" -- which few companies do. It’s true there’s been much more money dumped into elections this year, with a lot less disclosure. A Washington Post analysis found that less than half of the total third-party spending this election was disclosed with donors’ identities. "Nothing is greater than the Citizens United decision in opening the floodgates," said Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist for Public Citizen. The nonprofit consumer advocacy group, based in D.C., has urged Congress to pass a disclosure law to fix the ruling. In fact, a host of nonpartisan groups interested in open government called for the same. The national League of Women Voters issued a call earlier this month for television stations to reject ads paid for with secret money. Marge Easley, president of the League of Women Voters of Oregon, wanted to make clear that the nonpartisan group favors neither candidate in the 5th District. But she added that if a candidate is "not in favor of disclosure of campaign funding, then that means they are in favor of keeping things secret." So is Bruun in favor of secrecy or disclosure when it comes to campaign spending? Significantly, Bruun does oppose the Disclose Act, which would have required groups to name donors behind commercial ads. Bruun’s campaign spokeswoman Alee Lockman wrote in e-mails that Bruun supports "transparency & reporting in campaign finance" but disagrees with the way the Disclose Act "is set up." "He is, of course, open to bipartisan discussions about campaign finance regulations, but as he is not in Congress yet, he can’t speculate on what hypothetical legislation he may or may not be presented with," she wrote. Bruun has said he favors Oregon's system, which has no limits on contributions but requires full disclosure of donor information. In sum, as over the top as Merkley’s statement may be, PolitiFact Oregon finds it to be Half True. Comment on this item.	None	Jeff Merkley	None	None	None	2010-10-27T06:00:00	2010-09-17	['None']
pomt-07465	"What we have done with the PATRIOT Act, we've given the government enormous powers. We've given the government the right to reach deeply into people's private lives, into their business affairs, without a court order."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/apr/18/dennis-kucinich/rep-dennis-kucinich-critical-over-reach-patriot-ac/	A vocal opponent of the PATRIOT Act since its passage nearly a decade ago, Rep. Dennis Kucinich has been in the thick of the discussion since Congress teetered on the brink of refusing to renew some key provisions. With the help of Tea Party Republicans the Democratic minority in Congress did, indeed, preempt renewal when the vote went 277 to 148 for a nine-month extension of three key provisions. That was short of the two-thirds majority needed to keep the provisions alive through then end of the calendar year. They came back Feb. 17 and voted for an extension for 90 days to allow further debate. And it passed. Not surprisingly, Kucinich had many things to say, invoking among other things, "The Star Spangled Banner," the spirit of the First Amendment and bi-partisanship in defense of basic liberties. From the floor of the House and in a Feb. 10 press release, he said: "What we have done with the PATRIOT Act, we've given the government enormous powers. We've given the government the right to reach deeply into people's private lives, into their business affairs, without a court order. We need to think about that." Given that the debate will soon be revived as the 90-day extension nears expiration, PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look. The House was debating extensions of three provisions that already expanded the government’s ability to keep an eye on us, and Kucinich rattled them off by the numbers, citing sections 206, 215 and 6001. House Republicans posted the three sections online at the official GOP website. Their legislative digest didn’t quote Kucinich, but didn’t disagree with his reading of the provisions either. "Business Records Provision (the So-Called "Library Provision"—Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act): This provision allows the FBI to apply to the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance court for an order granting access to tangible items—including books, records, papers, and other documents—in foreign intelligence, international terrorism and clandestine intelligence cases." "Roving Wiretaps Provision (Section 206 of the PATRIOT Act): This provision authorizes FISA orders for multipoint or "roving" wiretaps for foreign intelligence investigations. A "roving" wiretap applies to an individual and allows the government to use a single wiretap order to cover any communications device that the suspect uses or may use." "Lone Wolf Provision (Section 6001 of Intelligence Reform Act): This provision amends the definition of "agent of a foreign power" to include individual foreign terrorists who may not be directly affiliated with a foreign power or international terrorist organization. This provision would prevent terrorists who work on their own from escaping surveillance simply because they are not agents of a foreign power or avowed members of an international terrorist group. This provision ONLY applies to foreign terrorists or agents of a foreign power." So do the extensions of these three provisions allow the government to reach more deeply into people’s lives? Yes, though the third one, the Lone Wolf provision, only applies to "foreign terrorists or agents of a foreign power." Language in Sections 215 and 206, two Kucinich specifically cited, enables federal investigators to gain access to things like library records, e-mails and financial papers and to wiretap multiple communications devices. But can it be done without a court order, as the congressman said? Kucinich and other critics of provisions in the PATRIOT Act decry that the law allows for warrant-less searches. Federal law enforcement officials do not have to go the regular route to obtain court authorization to conduct searches and collect evidence. In those cases the court’s orders would ultimately become public. The sections cited in the PATRIOT Act allow federal law enforcement to apply to a court for an order, but it’s through a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which operates very differently than other U.S. courts. In the case of these special courts, the proceedings are conducted behind closed doors and kept secret. Kucinich is correct that the PATRIOT Act opens the door for government to conduct broad levels of surveillance into U.S. citizens’ lives and activities and that the surveillance can be without traditional law enforcement having to get the traditional warrant. But the law does require an order from a court, albeit a special court that can do so secretly. That’s an important detail. On the Truth-O-Meter, Kucinich’s claim rates as Half True.

pomt-08236	"Rick Scott got a majority of the Hispanic vote in Florida."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/nov/15/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-rick-scott-won-florida-hispanic-vote/	On a swing through Florida to promote his presidential memoir, Decision Points, George W. Bush was joined by his brother Jeb to talk about the Bush family name, the 2010 midterm elections and the upcoming 2012 presidential election. Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, reiterated that he would not run for president in 2012 -- despite pleas from his brother -- and that he wasn't interested in becoming the chairman of the Republican National Committee, either. "I'm Switzerland as it relates to national Republican politics," Bush told CNN's Candy Crowley in an interview that aired Nov. 14, 2010. Yet Jeb -- who is 57, and seven years younger than the former president -- still was quick to talk politics when the issue turned to the results of the 2010 midterm elections. The topic -- why Latino or Hispanic voters voted 2-to-1 for Democrats over Republicans, according to Crowley. "That's some problemo," George W. Bush started, when hearing Crowley's figure (Another transcript recorded Bush as saying, "Es un problema"). After some back and forth, Jeb provided a bit of nuance to the debate over whether Republicans can attract Hispanic voters by talking about the race for governor in Florida. "Rick Scott got a majority of the Hispanic vote in Florida. We elected two Hispanic governors, Susana Martinez and Brian Sandoval (Martinez was elected governor in New Mexico and Sandoval in Nevada.) There were congressmen and women elected of Hispanic origin," said Jeb, who speaks Spanish fluently and whose wife is Mexican. "I think the problem is not just a West Coast problem but it is a big-time California problem. And I think a part of it relates to tone. "If you're watching TV, and someone is kind of legitimately angry that we can't control our border, and sending signals that it's them and us, and, by the way, you're not 'us,' you're 'them,' it doesn't matter what else, people turn out. If they (don't) feel like they're welcome, they're not going to listen to the message. "Hispanics want the border controlled," Jeb added. "A great nation has to control its border for national security purposes, for all sorts of purposes. And no one has -- I don't know anybody that says, 'Yes, let's just open up our border to create chaos.' So once the border is controlled and people view it that way and there's a perception, it's benchmarked and people say, 'Yes,' then I think you're going to find that there is ground to change our immigration policy to help us grow faster as a nation and to welcome people that work hard and play by the rules to create prosperity for us." If Hispanic voters overwhelmingly supported Democrats nationwide, we wondered if Jeb was right that the script was flipped in Florida, where Republican Rick Scott narrowly defeated Democrat Alex Sink in the race for governor. There's no official certified count of who Hispanic or Latino voters supported in any given election, so Jeb and others rely on exit polling data. The data is just like it sounds -- researchers interview people after leaving the polling place and try, using a sample of the electorate, to replicate the voter turnout by gender, race, age and other characteristics. Exit polling measures how people voted but also tries to figure out why. Like any other poll, exit polling has a margin of error. This year's national and Florida exit polling was conducted by Edison Media Research for the National Election Pool. Researchers interviewed 3,185 voters in Florida at 45 polling places on election day and also included a telephone poll of absentee and early voters. The bottom-line numbers back the Bush brothers up. Democrats had a nearly 2-to-1 advantage -- 64 percent to 34 percent -- over Republicans in U.S. House races among Latino or Hispanic voters, according to the data. Yet the same exit polling data said Scott defeated Sink in Florida among Hispanic voters 50 percent to 48 percent. You can see the 50-48 split in this Miami Herald report or in this report crated by the the Pew Hispanic Center, which studied the Hispanic 2010 vote. The Sink-Scott race itself was extraordinarily close, so Hispanic voters were about as divided as everybody else. But if you're from Florida, and you're a Bush, you should know to be at least a little leery of exit polling (See, 2000). Joe Lenski, executive vice president of Edison Media Research, told PolitiFact Florida that the Scott/Sink split of the Hispanic vote has a 7 percentage point margin of error. Statistically, that means it is entirely possible Sink won the Hispanic vote. Or Scott. Or that it was a razor-thin margin. The large margin of error is because while researchers interviewed more than 3,000 voters, they only spoke with 332 people who identified themselves as Hispanic. In its methods statement accompanying the results, Edison Media Research specifically said that "characteristics for minority racial groups will have larger sampling errors." "The exit polls are always taken like gospel, but they are a survey," Lenski said. In this case, the percentages could swing on just a handful of votes. By our calculation, if four voters said they voted for Sink and not Scott, Sink would have won the Hispanic vote, according to exit polling. For the record, Lenski attributes Scott's performance among Hispanic voters in large part to the Cuban vote. Lenski said Scott carried Cuban voters 68-32 percent, while Sink won the non-Cuban Hispanic vote 65-33. Those numbers also have large margins of error. But the gap is easily outside those margins. Which brings us back to Jeb Bush, who said Rick Scott won a majority of the Hispanic vote in his close victory for governor. Bush was trying to make the point that some Republicans were successful in attracting Hispanic voters. And on that broader point he's right. Scott far outperformed most Republicans across the country when it comes to Hispanic or Latino voters. But it's a stretch to say he definitively won the majority of Hispanic voters. Exit polling shows that Scott carried the Hispanic vote 50-48, but the poll itself comes with a 7 percentage point margin of error, which means it's impossible to make a broad declaration of victory for either candidate. The margin of error too often gets lost in translation or political headlines. But not for us. We rate this statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-14006	Says Donald Trump "has the gall to say that prisoners of war like John McCain aren’t heroes."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/03/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-attacks-donald-trump-over-his-war-/	Hillary Clinton accused Donald Trump of disrespecting veterans in a scathing speech, just days after Trump made headlines by giving $5.6 million in donations to 40 veterans groups. "He says climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese, and he has the gall to say that prisoners of war like John McCain aren’t heroes," Clinton said in her June 2, 2016, speech. In a separate fact-check, we rated the climate change claim Mostly True. Here, we’ll take on the claim about McCain. It dates back to a Trump an event in Ames, Iowa, on July 18, 2015. Trump, referring to McCain, R-Ariz., said "he’s not a war hero." McCain spent five and a half years in a Vietnamese prison camp. Trump’s comments were criticized by many of his then-competitors for the Republican presidential nomination. Texas Gov. Rick Perry, for example, said Trump was "unfit" to be commander-in-chief for his remarks — the very point Clinton aimed to make throughout her speech. Since then, Trump has claimed repeatedly that his statements were misinterpreted. We have looked at Trump’s statements before, but we wanted to re-examine the issue to see whether Clinton’s characterization of Trump’s words is accurate. The feud The bad blood between McCain and Trump started on July 16, 2015, when McCain said Trump had "fired up the crazies" at an Arizona anti-immigration rally. A few days later in Iowa, Trump fired back during an interview with Republican pollster Frank Luntz. Trump accused McCain of not doing enough for veterans and proceeded to call McCain a "loser," at which point Luntz expressed incredulity, noting multiple times that McCain was a war hero. Here’s the back-and-forth: Luntz: "He’s a war hero. He’s a war hero …" Trump: "He’s not a war hero ..." Luntz: "He’s a war hero." Trump: "He is a war hero ..." Luntz: "Five and half years in a Vietnamese prison camp …" Trump: "He’s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured. So he’s a war hero …" Luntz: "Do you agree with that?" Trump: "He’s a war hero, because he was captured, okay? I believe, perhaps, he’s a war hero. But right now he said some very bad things about a lot of people. So what I said is John McCain, I disagree with him that these people aren’t crazy." Clinton would certainly be correct accusing Trump of saying McCain is not a war hero, which he does right off the bat. Trump does attempt to walk it back immediately, but he does so with caveats that continue to question McCain’s service -- suggesting he is only a war hero because he was captured -- and seemingly mock captured soldiers. Also, in a press conference immediately after the rally, Trump insisted he was not blaming McCain for being captured. On a radio show May 11, 2016, Trump also said McCain is a hero. "You know frankly, I like John McCain, and John McCain is a hero," Trump said on the Imus in the Morning radio show. In an interview on the O’Reilly Factor on July 20, 2015, Trump told Bill O’Reilly that he would "take back his remarks" if there was a "misunderstanding," adding that he has since corrected them to express what he meant. Clinton’s comments Clinton’s remarks can be interpreted in different ways. On the one hand, Trump did call McCain, a POW, "not a hero," even if Trump has since distanced himself from that position. However, Clinton’s remarks have a broader interpretation as well — that Trump has made a general statement against POWs being heroes, with McCain as an example. That insinuation is present in what Trump said, as the Clinton press office and spokesman Zac Petkanas pointed out. "I like people who weren’t captured, okay?" Trump said at the initial Iowa rally. But Trump has repeatedly offered statements that support POWs more broadly. In the press conference immediately after the rally, Trump said that all prisoners are war heroes, with the exception of Bowe Bergdahl. "If a person is captured, they’re a hero as far as I’m concerned, unless they are a traitor," Trump said. Trump also explained his comments about liking veterans who weren’t captured, saying that soldiers, both captured and not-captured, deserve credit. "You have many people who didn’t get captured, I respect them greatly. You have many people who did get captured, I respect them greatly also," Trump said. Trump also pivoted back to his main talking point -- that McCain has failed to advocate for veterans in the Senate (a statement we have previously rated False). Our ruling Clinton accused Trump in a speech Thursday of having "the gall to say that prisoners of war like John McCain aren’t heroes." In one sense, she has a point. Trump did in fact say that John McCain is not a hero despite his POW record, although Trump has since taken those comments back and called McCain a hero. However, Clinton’s speech was intended to more broadly attack Trump’s national security credentials, yet Trump has never made the general statement that POWs are not heroes, even if his McCain-specific comments did insinuate it. In fact, he has insisted to the contrary on multiple occasions.

pomt-02205	Last election, the Koch brothers "spent three times what the top 10 unions spent combined."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/23/doonesbury/doonesbury-says-koch-brothers-outspent-unions-3-1/	The billionaire Koch brothers, Charles and David, have become titans of money in politics. The two personally have given over $3.2 million to federal candidates and parties over the past 15 years. But that sum represents just a sliver of their ability to bring cash to bear. By one count, they spent over $400 million during the 2012 elections alone through a series of affiliated and hard-to-track groups. This Sunday, the comic strip Doonesbury took aim at brothers Charles and David. The character Kim bemoaned the impact of the Supreme Court on campaign money. "You know, the Roberts court really did screw us over with Citizens United," she said to Mike Doonesbury, speaking about the U.S. Supreme Court and a decision that allows corporations and unions to contribute unlimited amounts of money to political campaigns. "Last election cycle, a pair of nasty billionaires spent three times what the top 10 unions spent combined." "You mean David and Charles Koch? The respected civic-minded job-creators?" asked Mike. It might be a comic strip, but Doonesbury certainly reaches plenty of eyeballs. And in this case, the claim is no laugher. We can fact-check whether the Koch brothers themselves spent three times as much as the top 10 unions in the last election. We asked Doonesbury creator Garry Trudeau where he got his numbers, and he pointed us to a couple of articles. One from the Huffington Post tied the two men to a total of $490 million. The other from Republic Report, a liberal investigative project, found that the top 10 unions (based on their donations) accounted for $153 million. That’s actually a little more than a 3 to 1 difference. "I rounded it in Kochs’ favor for rhetorical purposes," Trudeau said. But the numbers aren’t so simple. In fact, after talking to independent experts, we could not find an apples-to-apples comparison that included all the Koch brothers’ spending and all the union spending that ranges from local to federal races, and from supporting a candidate to supporting a cause. A limited comparison is possible, and we’ll get to that in a bit, but when it comes to tracking Koch money, the two brothers have set up a Byzantine network of nonprofits that make it impossible to know how much of their own money they have put into the game. The Koch brothers' spending We can say for sure that the $490 million Trudeau cited came from more people than just Charles and David Koch. It included campaign contributions from Koch Industries political action committees and from Koch Industries employees. In fact, the article itself doesn’t contend that all the money came from the Kochs. It called it part of the "Koch network." "I saw that claim in Doonesbury and was surprised by it," Lloyd Hitoshi Mayer, a University of Notre Dame Law School professor who studies political nonprofits, told us. "Trudeau may have mistakenly overestimated the amount attributable to the Koch brothers." Mayer noted that financial records show that at least $39 million spent by the Koch-affiliated group Americans for Prosperity came from donors other than the Kochs. The biggest share, $407 million, came from the Koch’s unusual network of nonprofits. This network has been the focus of intensive research. The Washington Post and the Center for Responsive Politics, a group that tracks money in politics, sifted through 17,000 tax records to piece together how the Koch network deploys its funds. Its signature method is to create what are called "disregarded entities." These are nonprofits that totally mask the people behind them. Robert Maguire is the center’s lead investigator. "We haven’t found a network of organizations like this anywhere else," Maguire said. "The Koch brothers have mobilized this money and the amount is incomparable, even relative to other conservative funding organizations." Maguire and the nonprofit investigative journalism organization ProPublica have documented how the legal structure of this network allows the Koch brothers to exercise a great deal of control over how this money is spent. The Kochs organize regular meetings where they invite donors who share their policy goals to join with them in common purpose. Managers and lawyers with strong ties to the Kochs play a key role in running this network. But so far, the corporate veil remains impenetrable. That means while the Kochs control the purse strings, the money doesn’t all come out of their pocket. "We have no idea how much of the money comes from the Kochs," Maguire said. The union spending There are difficulties, too, in trying to calculate spending by unions. We found a variety of totals for union political spending, although only the one cited by Trudeau exclusively tallied up the activities of the top 10. Remember, Doonesbury compared the Kochs to that smaller group. One of the problems is the national unions give money, but so do their local affiliates. Some of that spending is on candidates and parties, and some is on lobbying. A comparable analysis on the Koch Industries side would include similar spending by its 12 companies and their subsidiaries. We did not find anything like that. The Huffington Post estimated total union spending on elections and lobbying nationwide at $1.7 billion. It cautioned that this probably included double counting. The Republic Report had a total for the top 10 unions of $153 million. To further complicate the picture, the unions also give through third-party organizations that don’t reveal their donors. However, in this arena, unions face some special reporting requirements. A Huffington Post analysis found that a pro-Democrat group, Patriot Majority USA, received about $2.26 million from unions in 2012. We would also note that when it comes to action on the ground in elections, unions can deploy hundreds of volunteers in a single city -- a way to influence the political process that the Kochs cannot match. Volunteers are not campaign spending, but they are a key tool in the political process. The lone apples-to-apples comparison We know there are holes in the data, both on the Koch and union sides. We don’t know how big those holes are, but there is one narrow part of the political world where we can find reliable data. Federal elections offer the most uniform framework for tracking campaign money. There is information on donations to candidates, parties and political action committees, and information on expenditures. Once the Center for Responsive Politics figured out the names of the many nonprofits in the Koch network, it was able to spot when those dollars showed up in the federal database or tax documents. In 2012, the center found that groups in the Koch network, so-called social welfare organizations with 501(c)(4) tax status, spent $170 million, and $86 million of that had come through the Koch network's main donor organizations. The comparable number for all the union groups, those with a 501(c)(5) tax status, was $24 million. "We can trace $86 million back to the top of the Koch network," Maguire said. "The magnitude far exceeds the total for the liberal and union groups." Again, this is not total spending. It is just a comparison where the kind of organizations and the use of the money are matched as closely as possible. In other words, for this sort of political money tracked at the federal level, the network linked to the Koch brothers spent three and a half times more than the unions. We contacted Koch Industries for a response to Trudeau’s claim and did not hear back. Our ruling Doonesbury, aka Garry Trudeau, said the Koch brothers spent three times more than the top 10 unions combined in the 2012 elections. The information came from sources that attempted to track the political giving of the Kochs and the biggest unions. But there are some complications with the numbers. On the Koch side, the sources Trudeau cited did not say that all of the money connected to David and Charles Koch was their personal money. The Kochs have played a key role in creating a unique legal mechanism to raise and spend money that obscures the ultimate donors, and the nature of that mechanism gives them a high level of of control over how it is spent. To some extent, unions also feed into third-party money operations. And union political activity is spread much wider and among more organizations than the Kochs’ giving. In short, a true apples-to-apples comparison is quite difficult. That said, one independent analysis of trackable federal data found organizations tied to the Kochs spent three and a half times what unions did in 2012. How does all of this shake out? Trudeau goes too far in ascribing all of the money to the Kochs but the ratio he offers is in the ballpark of what we can determine at the federal level. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-12186	In economic growth, "Obama's best year was slower than Bill Clinton's worst year."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2017/jul/27/newt-gingrich/was-barack-obamas-best-economic-year-worse-bill-cl/	How bad was the economy under President Barack Obama? Pretty bad, argues former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. In economic growth, "Obama's best year was slower than Bill Clinton's worst year," Gingrich told Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo on July 23, 2017. "That's astonishing." We’ve previously looked at why it’s so hard these days for the United States to sustain 3 percent annual economic growth — a benchmark President Donald Trump says the country can again reach with his leadership. But we wondered whether the difference in economic performance under the two most recent Democratic presidents was so stark. We found that Gingrich’s talking point is correct, though he leaves out some important context. Annual economic growth is typically measured by the change, up or down, in gross domestic product from year to year, after adjusting for inflation. This data is collected by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a federal office. As it turns out, Clinton had two years tied for last place -- 1993 and 1995. In both years, GDP grew by 2.7 percent. As for Obama, his best annual showing came in 2015, with 2.6 percent. In the following chart, the worst Clinton years and the best Obama year are marked in blue. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com So by the primary measure, Gingrich’s statement is correct. However, it’s worth noting that a related statistic shows the record on Obama’s watch in a somewhat more favorable light. Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, said that GDP growth depends on two major factors -- how productive workers are, and how many workers there are. And Clinton was blessed with a worker population that was growing much faster than it later would under Obama. When Clinton was president, Burtless said, the population between the ages of 15 and 64 increased by 1.2 percent a year. Under Obama, the increase was just 0.6 percent. "So it seems to me a bit absurd to compare overall GDP growth in the two administrations without somehow accounting for the different rates of growth in the population," Burtless said. It’s possible to use a variant on our previous metric — GDP growth per capita — that lessens this problem. Here’s what that measurement looks like: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Using this measurement, Obama exceeded Clinton’s worst annual performance during four years (2010, 2012, 2014, 2015). In other words, while Clinton still did better overall when population growth is taken into account, the Obama administration had a better experience using this metric than is implied by Gingrich's statement, Burtless said. Gingrich’s office did not reply to an inquiry. Our ruling Gingrich said that in economic growth, "Obama's best year was slower than Bill Clinton's worst year." Measured by the annual change in inflation-adjusted GDP -- the typical measurement -- Gingrich is correct. But it’s worth noting that if you strip out the impact of population growth, the Clinton-Obama comparison is more mixed. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-07358	From 2008 to 2011, "the pages in the conforming bills have gone from 400 pages to 2,200."	true	/florida/statements/2011/may/07/jack-latvala/senator-rails-against-growing-conforming-budget-bi/	A group of state senators temporarily threw the Florida Legislature into upheaval on May 6, 2011, after several Republicans joined Democrats in opposing a pair of bills that were tied to the $69.7 billion budget. The bills -- called conforming bills -- generally provide language to carry out how the Legislature wants money in the budget to be spent. But leaders in the House and Senate also tacked on two substantive bills to deregulate several professions, including interior designers. On top of that, senators had just hours to read the bills -- 43 of them -- and then cast votes. So, senators put their collective foot down. A bill to deregulate interior designers died in the Senate 32-6. Another conforming bill died 21-18. State Sen. Jack Latvala, who previously served in the Senate from 1994-2002 and was elected again in 2010, took to the floor early in the morning on May 7 to decry the entire process. "I don't really want to get into winners and losers. I think that winners and losers, which ever way they interpret it, are the people of Florida," Latvala said. "There is one lesson I hope we learn. When I left the Florida Senate in 2002, the (conforming) bill was 11 or 12 pages. Sen. (Thad) Altman recently counted the number of pages for the implementing bill in 2008, it was 400 pages. I mean, conforming bills. Sen. Altman also counted the pages in the conforming bills this year -- 2,200. "In three years, the pages in the conforming bills have gone from 400 pages to 2,200," he said. Talking directly to Senate President Mike Haridopolos, Latvala then said: "I pray that when we have the closing night of our session next year that your leadership will show us that we can turn the clock back on that trend." Latvala's numbers -- courtesy of Altman -- may sound staggering. But they're pretty much right. House and Senate leaders proposed 43 conforming bills to go alongside their nearly 500-page budget. We counted the pages of each of the bills. Some takeaways: * A government reorganization bill, SB 2156, was so big that we couldn't download it onto our computer in an Adobe Acrobat version. We had to open a different version of the bill to find out that it includes 20,990 lines of text -- which would translate to about 740 pages; * A growth management bill, HB 7207, measured 349 total pages; * The smallest conforming bill was just two pages. It eliminated the cybercrime unit in the Attorney General's office. In total, we counted 2,170 pages of conforming bills (the specific number can vary slightly based on the exact number of pages in the government reorganization bill). Compare that to 2008, when there were 29 conforming bills and a total of 499 pages. We built a spreadsheet so you can see the difference between the years for yourself. Latvala said that from 2008-2001, "the pages in the conforming bills have gone from 400 pages to 2,200." We rate this claim True.

pomt-11195	"There are some counties in Texas where the first day of hunting, you have to shut down the schools because people are going to go hunting."	false	/texas/statements/2018/may/16/lupe-valdez/lupe-valdez-says-texas-schools-some-counties-shut-/	The former Dallas County sheriff running for governor made us wonder about Texas schools that shut down when it’s hunting time. We failed to find evidence for Lupe Valdez’s claim, although state law permits school districts to manage their own calendars so it’s possible for a district to declare a holiday for a community activity (including hunting) so long as schools stay open long enough through the year. Valdez faces Houston investor Andrew White in a May 22, 2018 Democratic primary runoff with the victor facing Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in November. She was asked in a May 8, 2018 Facebook Live interview by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram editorial board if she still carries her service firearm and how she believes gun laws should change. Valdez, who favors universal background checks for gun purchases, replied: "You know, I believe in the Second Amendment. I believe in all the amendments. And I continue to carry my weapon. That’s part of my morning routine. It’s been for over 40 years. Valdez went on to say that a person "who cannot solve their issues by other than total violence should never be allowed to carry a weapon." Next came her hunting claim. Valdez said: "There are some counties in Texas where the first day of hunting, you have to shut down the schools because people are going to go hunting. That’s a source of sports for them. But that isn’t a source of violence for the majority of those folks." Valdez’s campaign didn’t respond to our inquiries about the basis for her hunting claim. Agencies, school districts unaware of hunting holidays When we queried the Texas Education Agency, spokeswoman Lauren Callahan responded that districts set their own calendars. State law requires each district to operate for at least 75,600 minutes a school year unless the state education commissioner grants permission to run short. "While districts may consult agency staff for guidance as they adopt a local calendar, they do not submit the calendars to us for approval once they are adopted," Callahan said by email. At the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department, Steve Lightfoot replied by email that in 2018, the Texas dove hunting and deer hunting seasons begin on Saturdays--Sept. 1 and Nov. 3, respectively. The Parks & Wildlife Commission, Lightfoot said, "supports providing opportunities to get youth involved in Texas’s rich hunting traditions, and sets aside youth-only weekends for that reason. I checked with staff who would know and they are unaware of schools or districts that close in recognition of hunting season," Lightfoot said. We also connected with Don Rogers, executive director of the Texas Rural Education Association; Rogers told us he was about to huddle with directors of the state’s regional education service centers. After that meeting, Rogers said by phone that none of the directors was aware of a district currently calling a holiday at the start of a hunting season. By phone, we also came up empty with a pair of Central Texas districts in hunting communities. James Payne of the Llano Independent School District said he’s worked in varied districts for 26 years and not heard of a district taking a holiday for the sake of a hunting season. "Do you think she was saying that in jest?" Payne said. Duane Limbaugh, superintendent of the Brady ISD, said that district doesn’t take a day off for the sake of hunting though he’s heard of districts declaring a staff work day for the start of a hunting season. In his experience, he said, most student hunters get their hunting done in time to be in school by mid-morning. Our ruling Valdez declared: "There are some counties in Texas where the first day of hunting, you have to shut down the schools because people are going to go hunting." We didn’t learn how Valdez reached this conclusion, for which we found no confirmation. We rate this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-10620	"Congress just passed another huge, pork-filled spending bill. The Democrats allowed less than a day to read all 3,400 pages and stuffed it with nearly 10,000 earmarks costing about $10-billion dollars."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/16/john-mccain/more-in-the-8-billion-range/	One reason John McCain is so unpopular with fellow senators is his relentless, high-volume crusade against pork — specifically the earmarks for local projects that lawmakers are fond of tucking into annual congressional spending bills. So it was hardly surprising that McCain chose to showcase his fiscally conservative credentials in the days before the Michigan primary by assailing Democratic congressional leaders for loading the year-end fiscal 2008 omnibus spending bill with money for local projects. "Congress just passed another huge, pork-filled spending bill. The Democrats allowed less than a day to read all 3,400 pages and stuffed it with nearly 10,000 earmarks costing about $10-billion dollars," McCain said in remarks delivered to the Americans for Prosperity Michigan summit in a Detroit suburb. The bill McCain cites is the $555-billion package of 11 unfinished spending bills that Congress bundled together and cleared in a crush of last-minute business in mid-December. While the general thrust of McCain's remarks are correct, he's exaggerating some facts to drive home his point. It's technically correct that the Senate had less than a day to read the final version of the legislation; 10 hours and 11 minutes elapsed between when the House voted on a rule adding 10 spending bills to the State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill the evening of Dec. 17 and when the Senate first voted on the package the next afternoon. But while McCain's point is well taken, it's not at all uncommon for major legislation to be completed and turned around on short notice at the end of a congressional session before lawmakers can read it line-by-line. Frequently, members and senators vote with the understanding their party leaders have negotiated or signed off on the most significant details. The bill itself was 613 pages — hardly light reading, but nowhere near the 3,400 pages McCain depicts. In fairness, McCain might have been referring to accompanying conference reports and other documents that detail House-Senate negotiations on the package. McCain also appears to be leaning on the scale in detailing the number of earmarked projects. A preliminary analysis by Taxpayers for Common Sense, which makes a practice of closely tracking earmarks, puts the number of projects in the package at 8,983 worth $7.4-billion. If one adds a fiscal 2008 defense spending bill that Congress passed as a stand-alone measure, the total grows to 11,144 earmarks worth $15.3-billion. The group says it's still scouring conference reports and other documents to establish a final number. But it's misleading to blame the pork just on Democrats. The Republicans learned how to pack the pork when they ran Congress and they got plenty in this bill, too. Though earmarking remains hugely popular, lawmakers are being more discreet about their requests due to a new lobbying and disclosure law that changed Senate rules. It requires that all earmarks and their sponsors, including those in conference reports, be identified on the Internet at least 48 hours before the Senate votes. Earmarks added in conference — known as airdropped provisions — can be challenged through points of order. Watchdog groups report Democrats have tried to make good on a pledge they made upon assuming control of Congress to limit the number of earmark-funded projects. Not surprisingly, McCain fails to note that his own party turned the appropriations process into a veritable earmark mill during the GOP's 12 years in power. "There are a lot of self-proclaimed fiscally conservative Republicans who take earmarks," said Keith Ashdown, chief investigator for the watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense, adding that McCain has walked his talk by refraining from making requests for local projects. The gist of his charge is true about spending, but his numbers are off and it's misleading to suggest all the parochial spending is being done by Democrats. When we add it up, we get Half-True.

pomt-10514	Both McCain and Bush favor tax breaks for oil companies.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/17/campaign-defend-america/mccain-voted-against-bushs-energy-bill/	An ad from the Campaign to Defend America attacks Sen. John McCain as being the same as President George W. Bush on a number of issues, including Iraq, taxes and health care . It also bashes the two on energy policy. "Oil companies, they get tax breaks while we pay at the pump. McSame as Bush," the ad states. The Bush administration's signature energy initiative was the Energy Policy Act of 2005, a major piece of legislation that included subsidies and incentives for several sectors of the energy industry, including oil companies. It was the first national energy legislation in more than a decade, and the Bush administration worked for several years to get it passed. We ruled previously that the bill contained significant measures to encourage clean energy . To be sure, the bill still had its detractors. Some people felt it included too many incentives for industry and too little to help consumers. Those detractors included McCain. "This bill does little to address the immediate energy crisis we face in this country," he said in a statement his Senate office issued at the time. "The handouts to big business and oil companies are irresponsible and will be disastrous for the people of Arizona. I cannot in good conscience vote to pass legislation that does not adequately address issues related to energy efficiency, security, and energy independence." The statement noted that McCain liked the plan's reliability standards and incentives for new refinery capacity, but concluded that the bad outweighed the good. McCain also said he opposed it because it might make pump prices higher with its mandates for the increased use of ethanol. On the final vote on the bill, McCain was one of 26 senators who voted against it. ( Hillary Clinton also opposed it while Barack Obama voted for it. ) The McSame ad doesn't mention this legislation specifically, but it was a priority of the Bush administration and a notable source of tax breaks for the oil and gas industry. McCain opposed it. You can't call them the "McSame" for such a significant difference. For this reason, we find the statement False.

pomt-09846	Pregnant women trying to buy health insurance on their own are barred from maternity coverage because they have a "pre-existing condition."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/18/j-james-rohack/ama-president-says-pregnant-women-are-barred-buyin/	You've probably heard of "pre-existing conditions," which provide an escape clause for health insurance companies. If you have a pre-existing condition, an insurance company typically won't pay for treatment. J. James Rohack, president of the American Medical Association, cited them when he was asked during an appearance on Fox News Sunday on Aug. 16, 2009, whether the Democratic health plan would lead to rationing for older patients. "Well, there's a myth that rationing doesn't occur right now," Rohack said. "In the United States, if a woman's pregnant and on the individual market (and) tries to get health insurance, that's called a pre-existing condition and it's not paid for. That's why this bill's important. It gets rid of some of the rationing that's occurring right now." The AMA endorsed the House version of health care reform legislation in July. First, we should emphasize that he's only talking about the relatively small number of women who buy their coverage through what insurers call the individual market. About two-thirds of women have health insurance through their employer or their spouse's employer, and about 13 percent have public coverage such as Medicaid or military health care. So the people affected by these limitations include the 19 percent now uninsured and the 6 percent that have coverage purchased on the individual market. These policies are sold directly to an individual by a private insurer, and the purchaser doesn't get the same consumer protections routinely given to those who have coverage through an employer. For example, people in employer-based health plans have benefited from requirements for maternity coverage that date back to the federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978. But individual plans are not included under that umbrella and are regulated state by state. In 39 states, listed here , insurers can turn down anyone for virtually any reason. It can be because you have a pre-existing condition, like cancer or diabetes. And pregnancy almost always counts too, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which represents the state government officials who regulate insurance sold within their borders. So if you're pregnant and living in one of these 39 states, you're very likely out of luck in securing individual health coverage. You'll have to pay for your care out of your own pocket or seek out charitable assistance. And the coverage isn't much better in the remaining 11 states. These states have "guaranteed issue" laws that say insurers cannot turn applicants down based on their health or risk status. But there's a caveat: Even if an insurer must offer you a plan, it can place exclusions on what the plan covers. Typically, the NAIC says, these exclusions last from six to 12 months, which rules out most or all maternity coverage. (After the exclusion expires, the insurer does have to cover those conditions, meaning that a subsequent pregnancy could be covered.) One category of individual policyholders has it slightly better ? those who leave an employer's plan that had given them uninterrupted coverage for the pre-existing condition in question. Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, people in this category can obtain a plan that covers their pre-existing condition once they have exhausted their old employer's coverage under the law known as COBRA. However, a state only has to provide a minimum of one "HIPAA plan" within its borders, rather than requiring that every insurer operating in the state offer one. Such plans may have unfavorable terms and high premiums. So back to Rohack's claim. Health care reform legislation now under consideration in Congress would, if enacted, improve the situation for pregnant women seeking health insurance by prohibiting restrictions based on pre-existing conditions. But for now, Rohack is correct that pregnancy is considered a pre-existing condition and prevents many women from getting coverage if they seek insurance on the individual market.

pomt-01144	In the U.S. agreement with the Cuban government, "no commitment was made to allowing the establishment of political parties or to even begin the semblance of a transition to a democracy."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/dec/18/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-talks-cuba-produced-no-commitment/	Sen. Marco Rubio -- a Republican born to Cuban emigres whose Florida constituency includes the nation’s largest concentration of Cuban-Americans -- has taken the lead opposing President Barack Obama’s overhaul of U.S.-Cuba relations. His main complaint: The United States isn’t getting enough out of the deal, especially when it comes to democratic reforms. On Dec. 17, 2014, Obama said the United States would be re-establishing diplomatic relations with Cuba for the first time in more than five decades, as well as easing longstanding travel and export restrictions. The move coincided with Cuba’s release of jailed American contractor Alan Gross. Rubio called the warming of relations "profoundly disappointing. It is a victory for the oppressive Cuban government, but a serious setback for the repressed Cuban people." To Rubio, the agreements between the two governments -- which had been worked out in secret over 18 months -- were one-sided, with the United States drawing the short end of the stick. Here’s more of what Rubio had to say at a press conference: "The White House has conceded everything and gained little. They gained no commitment on the part of the Cuban regime to freedom of press or freedom of speech or elections. No binding commitment was made to truly open up the Internet. No commitment was made to allowing the establishment of political parties or to even begin the semblance of a transition to a democracy. "And in exchange for all of these concessions, the only thing the Cuban government agreed to do is free 53 political prisoners who could wind up in jail tomorrow morning if they once again take up the cause of freedom and to allow the United Nations and the Red Cross to monitor conditions on the island, the same United Nations that did nothing when Cuba last year was caught helping North Korea evade United Nations sanctions." We wondered whether Rubio is right that, under the agreement, Cuba doesn’t have to "even begin the semblance of a transition to a democracy." What's in the agreement? After looking over the publicly available information, it seems like Rubio has a point. If talks between the United States and Cuba resulted in any final document, it hasn’t been released yet. Instead, we’ll rely on what the White House has made public in its comments. (Rubio’s office did not respond to an inquiry for this story.) On the subject of "human rights and civil society," a White House summary focuses mostly on what the United States promises to do in fostering those goals in Cuba, not on what the Castro regime had promised to do. The administration "will continue to implement U.S. programs aimed at promoting positive change in Cuba, and we will encourage reforms in our high level engagement with Cuban officials," the White House summary said. "Ultimately, it will be the Cuban people who drive economic and political reforms." In his remarks announcing the change in policy, Obama seemed to acknowledge that the two countries disagree on human rights and democracy. "Where we disagree, we will raise those differences directly -– as we will continue to do on issues related to democracy and human rights in Cuba," Obama said. "But I believe that we can do more to support the Cuban people and promote our values through engagement. After all, these 50 years have shown that isolation has not worked. It’s time for a new approach." This theme was reiterated during a conference call with reporters featuring unnamed "senior administration officials." They said that the United States’ emphasis on human rights won’t be decreasing, only pursued within a context of direct relations with the Cuban government. The officials said the United States would seek to leverage other nations’ efforts to promote democracy in Cuba, including at the Summit of the Americas in Panama next year. They said the difference now will be that the United States would conduct its democracy-building efforts -- which they said the Cuban government forcefully opposes -- within the context of normalized relations. Meanwhile, Raul Castro, in a televised speech from Havana, promised only "dialogue," not concrete steps, on democracy and human rights. He said Cuba recognizes "that we have profound differences fundamentally in the subject of national sovereignty, democracy, human rights and domestic policy. I reaffirm our willingness to dialogue on all these topics." Are there concrete steps? So far, we see nothing about what the Castro regime needs to do to promote democracy. Is there anything specific in what’s been announced? The answer is: A bit. During the conference call, officials said that the the Cuban government has made "sovereign decisions" to release 53 political prisoners whose cases were brought to Cuba’s attention by the U.S. government." In addition, the White House says the Cuban government said it would be taking steps to increase Internet connectivity for its citizens. The White House argues that, in conjunction with additional authorization for U.S. telecommunications companies to operate in Cuba, ordinary Cubans will be empowered by better Internet access. Finally, officials announced that Cuba would increase its engagement with the United Nations and with the International Committee of the Red Cross about monitoring conditions within Cuba. Indeed, Rubio mentioned these three steps in his press conference -- but even if these changes prove permanent (and there’s no guarantee they will) they were outweighed, in his view, by the lost opportunity to leverage bigger pro-democracy reforms, such as the creation of political parties and a loosening of the Castro family’s grip on the island’s politics. When we asked experts whether Rubio’s description is on target, they said it was. "It’s accurate," said Eric Farnsworth, who worked in the Clinton White House’s office of the special envoy for the Americas and now serves as vice president of the Council of the Americas. "Rubio is about right," agreed Brock Tessman, associate director of the Center for the Study of Global Issues at the University of Georgia. "While these initial changes, particularly the introduction of open media technology, may eventually lead to more profound political changes, nothing in yesterday's agreement commits Raul Castro to concrete steps toward democratization." Jonathan Benjamin-Alvarado, a political scientist at the University of Nebraska Omaha, concurred. He predicted that any concrete concessions on democracy and human rights would have to wait until -- or if -- Congress decides it’s ready to lift the decades-old trade embargo. "This is what Congress will argue must be dealt with for the embargo to be lifted," Benjamin-Alvarado said. He added, "I take Raul Castro’s response to mean that he too understands the nature of how normalization must unfold and what conditions will have to be addressed." Our ruling Rubio said that in the U.S.-Cuba negotiations, "no commitment was made to allowing the establishment of political parties or to even begin the semblance of a transition to a democracy." He’s largely correct. Cuba did promise to release 53 political prisoners, take steps to open up the Internet and allow greater scrutiny by international organizations. But the secret talks led to no breakthroughs in structural reform to a political system dominated for more than half a century by the Castro brothers. Rather than producing pro-democratic results now, the agreement seeks to create the conditions for results later. Rubio's statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2014-12-18T18:01:20	2014-12-17	['United_States', 'Cuba']
pomt-05667	Because of the new health care law, "17 million kids can no longer be denied for a pre-existing condition."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/16/barack-obama/barack-obama-film-says-health-care-law-aided-17-mi/	A new film from President Barack Obama's re-election campaign makes the case that his health care law has expanded coverage and stopped insurance companies from denying benefits to people because of previous illnesses. We’re checking several claims from the film, including this one, that "17 million kids can no longer be denied for a pre-existing condition." It’s true that the law prohibits excluding children with pre-existing conditions from private health insurance, effective six months following enactment. (Adults with pre-existing conditions get new protections that aren’t as strong.) We found problems with both the number of children affected by this provision and by how that number is used. The number It comes from an analysis by the Department of Health and Human Services. It used a list of serious health conditions to create two estimates of how many Americans would run into trouble with private insurers in the individual market if they ever needed to obtain insurance after a break in coverage. The first and more limited estimate counts the people who would likely be denied coverage outright if the new health care law is overturned (or was never passed). The second and more expansive estimate adds cases in which the applicant might be offered a more expensive policy or one that excludes the pre-existing condition in question. In the big picture, the study found that "as many as 82 million Americans with employer-based coverage have a pre-existing condition, ranging from life-threatening illnesses like cancer to chronic conditions like diabetes, asthma, or heart disease." Specifically looking at children, the study found that for the more limited definition -- one that would be expected to result in outright exclusion from coverage -- would affect 5 percent of minors. The broader definition, which could include policies that cover everything but the pre-existing condition or full coverage for a higher price, would affect 24 percent of children. "Translating these percentages into numbers of people, there are 4 to 17 million children under age 18 with some type of pre-existing condition," the HHS analysis said. So the film is cherry-picking the high end of that range. It’s also worth noting that the film has stripped some important context from this number. The film said that due to the new health care law, "17 million kids can no longer be denied for a pre-existing condition." That’s the higher of the two figures -- by a factor of more than four -- and one that includes cases in which the child isn’t actually denied, but in which the family has to pay higher premiums. For those situations, it’s not really accurate to say that they’ve been "denied" coverage, but rather that they are forced to pay more for coverage. How the number is used The phrasing the film uses -- "17 million kids can no longer be denied for a pre-existing condition" -- is open to interpretation. To watch the film, it’s easy to think that 17 million children have been freed from the shackles of pre-existing conditions and are now able to purchase coverage as a result of the law. But that’s not what the statistics used to back up this claim actually say. Most of those 17 million children already have insurance. The HHS study sampled the national U.S. population -- both insured and uninsured -- and looked at how many Americans in various age groups would be at risk of having a pre-existing condition that would pose barriers in the insurance market if they were currently uninsured and were seeking insurance on the individual market. For various reasons, including access to Medicaid or the State Children’s Health Insurance Program, the number of children nationally who were both (a) uninsured before the passage of the law, and (b) had a pre-existing condition that posed a barrier to their obtaining insurance is almost certainly a whole lot lower than 17 million. And it’s probably a whole lot lower than 4 million, too. We couldn’t find precise figures on this, but we can triangulate a bit. The same study says that "the number of people who both have a pre-existing condition and are uninsured ranges from 9 to 25 million -- or as much as 46 percent of the uninsured. Among non-elderly people with some type of pre-existing condition, about one in five, or 19 percent, is uninsured." Apply that percentage to the range of estimates and you get 760,000 to 3.2 million children who are uninsured due to pre-existing conditions. But even those estimates are probably too high. The likelihood of having a problematic pre-existing condition is not equal for all ages. According to the same study, children have pre-existing conditions either at one-fifth the rate of the population at large (using the first, narrower measurement) or one-third the rate of the population at large (using the second, broader measurement). If you multiply these rates by our previous estimate of uninsured children with pre-existing conditions, the numbers fall further -- to 160,000 on the low end and 1.1 million on the high end. That's a lot lower than 17 million. One additional point. The study argues -- and we wouldn’t deny -- that in the absence of the law, pre-existing conditions would be a big problem for people who "become self-employed, take a job with a company that does not offer coverage, or experience a change in life circumstance, such as divorce, retirement, or moving to a different state." But the film would have been more accurate if it had described the impact of the law as offering a backstop for people who have pre-existing conditions, whether they have no coverage or if they for any reason lose or give up their coverage in the future. Our ruling We find this claim problematic on several levels. While the law does serve as a backstop for those at risk of being denied coverage, the film cites the higher of two equally plausible estimates, cherry-picking a number that’s more than four times as high as the smaller estimate. And it glosses over a key difference: The study focused on people who could potentially be helped by the law if they found themselves uninsured in the future, not on those who actually were uninsured and were blocked from getting coverage by pre-existing conditions today. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-03-16T18:33:12	2012-03-16	['None']

These tweets offer a cornucopia of assertions we’ve already debunked, including the notion that Trump won the Electoral College in a "landslide" (False), that he won the popular vote (Pants on Fire), and that 3 million votes were cast by illegal aliens (False). We found zero evidence for Trump’s charge that he "won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally," and a lot of reasons to conclude that it didn’t happen. The current status of the vote Almost three weeks after Election Day, the ballots are mostly — but not entirely — counted. The most comprehensive vote-tracking analysis is published by David Wasserman of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. As of noon on Nov. 28, according to Wasserman’s calculations, Hillary Clinton led Trump by roughly 2.24 million votes -- specifically, 64,654,483 for Clinton, 62,418,820 for Trump, and 7,192,036 for other candidates. Late ballot tabulations in some states are still trickling in -- many of them states, such as California, where Clinton fared overwhelmingly well. For this reason, Wasserman tweeted on Nov. 26 that Clinton seems to be on track to win the popular vote by 2.5 million to 2.7 million votes, or a margin of about 2 percentage points over Trump. So to erase Trump’s popular-vote deficit, there would need to be almost 3 million votes for Clinton that were cast illegally. And that assumes that all 3 million of these "illegal votes" went to Clinton and not a single one went to Trump. That’s a really big number. For a sense of scale, 3 million votes is more than were cast for any presidential candidate in 36 states plus the District of Columbia. And 3 million people is more than a quarter of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States — a group that InfoWars specifically singled out as the source of 3 million illegal votes. A lack of evidence As we’ve previously noted, conspiracy-minded websites — notably Alex Jones’ InfoWars — have posted articles claiming that 3 million votes in the presidential election were "cast by illegal aliens." We rated that False. As evidence of its claim, InfoWars’ headline referred to a report from VoteFraud.org and tweets from Gregg Phillips, whose Twitter profile says he’s the founder of VoteStand, a voter fraud reporting app. However, there is no report from VoteFraud.org, and Phillips told PolitiFact he is not affiliated with that website. Tweets by Phillips on Nov. 11 and Nov. 13 said that "we have verified more than 3 million votes cast by non-citizens" and that Phillips had "completed analysis of database of 180 million voter registrations. Number of non-citizen votes exceeds 3 million. Consulting legal team." Phillips has not responded to PolitiFact’s queries for additional information. He told us previously that he has chosen not to release more information because he is still working on analyzing the data and verifying its accuracy. Phillips would not say what the data is or where it came from, or what methodology he used. He said he would release the information publicly once he is finished. On a Nov. 28 conference call with reporters, Trump spokesman Jason Miller mentioned two pieces of evidence that Trump had also cited earlier in the campaign. One was a 2012 Pew Center on the States study whose author denies that it found any evidence of voter fraud. The other was a 2014 article posted on the Monkey Cage blog hosted by the Washington Post; it prompted multiple articles by other political scientists casting doubt on its accuracy. In any case, neither study offers analysis of the 2016 electoral returns. True the Vote, a group that has argued that election fraud is widespread, gave Trump’s comment rhetorical support but did not provide specific evidence. Backing from elected Republicans was scarce. One GOP senator, James Lankford of Oklahoma, said on CNN's New Day, "I don't know what (Trump) was talking about on that one." He added that while there may be irregularity "on the edges," he has "not seen any voter irregularity in the millions." Voter fraud uncommon Other research suggests that voter fraud is not widespread. • News21, a national investigative reporting project funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, found just 56 cases of noncitizens voting between 2000 and 2011. • A report by the liberal Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law found that most cases of noncitizens voting were accidental. "Although there are a few recorded examples in which noncitizens have apparently registered or voted, investigators have concluded that they were likely not aware that doing so was improper," reads the 2007 report. • In 2012, Florida Gov. Rick Scott’s administration started an effort trying to crack down on noncitizens voting by comparing driver's license data against voter rolls. The Florida Department of State created a list of 182,000 potential noncitizens that had voted. That number was whittled down to 2,700, then to about 200 before the purge was stopped amid criticism that the data was flawed given the number of false positives — including a Brooklyn-born World War II vet. Ultimately, only 85 people were removed from the rolls. Meanwhile, ProPublica, an investigative journalism project, tweeted that "we had 1,100 people monitoring the vote on Election Day. We saw no evidence the election was ‘rigged’ " and "no evidence that undocumented immigrants voted illegally." Experts unconvinced Experts dismissed the substance of Trump’s tweet. "This is patently false," said Costas Panagopoulos, a Fordham University political scientist. "There would need to be a massive national conspiracy and coordination effort to do this, and illegal aliens would need to be on the voter rolls in states across the country months earlier to be eligible to vote. It is also very convenient the estimated fraudulent vote is just enough to give Trump the popular vote. Not likely a coincidence." Emory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz added, "If Mr. Trump seriously believes that there was significant vote fraud in any state, he should file a formal protest and ask for an investigation. He does not — he is simply repeating baseless claims." And University of Denver political scientist Seth Masket said the claim is short on basic logic. "It’s bizarre to claim that Clinton had the ability to generate millions of illegal voters but not use them to help her win the Electoral College," Masket said. Our ruling Trump tweeted that he "won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally." Neither Trump nor his allies have presented any evidence of widespread illegal voting. In reality, studies have consistently shown that voter fraud is nowhere near common enough to call into question millions and millions of votes. Indeed, the ability to carry off such a far-reaching conspiracy — potentially involving millions of people over the course of several months and without being noticed by election administration officials, many of them in states controlled by Republicans — is ridiculously illogical.

pomt-13709	"I’m not one for name calling."	pants on fire!	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/jul/28/ed-rendell/rendell-not-one-name-calling-sobs-idiots-wusses-be/	Rendell thinks Katie McGinty took things too far when she called Pat Toomey "an asshole." McGinty apologized for the comment hours after saying it, at a Communications Workers of America union event Monday. Rendell told Politico reporter Burgess Everett her remarks were "probably a little extreme." "I love Katie, but I’m not one for name calling," he said. "I think there’s too much disrespect in the business." He also said that she responded correctly in apologizing. Is Rendell truly "not one for name calling?" It’s tough to agree. We vividly remember the time he name-called the whole country. This was back in 2010, after the NFL bumped a late December Eagles home game against the Minnesota Vikings from a Sunday to a Tuesday due to weather. "We've become a nation of wusses. The Chinese are kicking our butt in everything," he told a local radio station. "If this was in China do you think the Chinese would have called off the game? People would have been marching down to the stadium, they would have walked and they would have been doing calculus on the way down." After his comments went viral, Rendell not only stuck to his guns, in 2012 he published a book on the topic: A Nation of Wusses: How America's Leaders Lost the Guts to Make Us Great. Wuss appears to be a common word in the Rendell lexicon. He called Chris Christie one in 2014 for rooting for the Cowboys. In 2012, he called then-Virginia Gov. Bob McConnell one for not voicing support for a ban on semiautomatic weapons. "I like Gov. McDonnell and think he does some good things, but he is being nothing but a coward and a wuss when he won’t confront the question," he stated on MSNBC. That same year, the Wall Street Journal and Boston Globe reported that despite condemning stimulus funding, Paul Ryan had actually requested some. By Rendell’s measure, Ryan was "a total wuss for denouncing something and then asking for money from it, and stating that it’s going to create jobs," as he told HuffPostLive. "Had Paul Ryan read my book, he would not have made [this] mistake he made on the campaign." It’s also hard to forget when, in 2011, Rendell didn’t appreciate some of "60 Minutes" correspondent Leslie Stahl’s questions. She was asking whether gambling legalization could have a poor influence on gambling addicts. Rendell reacted: "You’re not getting it. Those people would lose that money anyway. Don’t you understand?" Then... he popped off: "You guys don’t get that! You’re simpletons! You’re idiots if you don’t get that." Last year, after the Amtrak derailment in Philadelphia, Republican lawmakers in Congress backed a plan to cut Amtrak funding by $252 million. "Those SOBs, and that’s all I can call them, these SOBs didn’t even have the decency to table the vote," he told MSNBC’s Chris Hayes. And this May, he observed that many US women are "ugly." He felt, when assessing potential damage Donald Trump’s comments could have on his campaign, that one should consider the relative unattractiveness of women in the country. "For every one he’ll lose 1½ , two Republican women. Trump’s comments like ‘You can’t be a 10 if you’re flat-chested,’ that’ll come back to haunt him," he told the Washington Post. "There are probably more ugly women in America than attractive women. People take that stuff personally." Our Ruling Rendell told Everett, "I’m not one for name calling." Pennsylvanians know: Rendell can put his foot in his mouth. But he also can very purposefully read a fellow politician(s) for filth during a live broadcast. We’re not judging. We’re just saying.

pomt-09069	Says U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul is "the sixth-richest person in Congress."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/jun/28/ted-ankrum/ankrum-says-mccaul-sixth-richest-member-congress/	Painting his November opponent as an out-of-touch millionaire, Democrat Ted Ankrum invoked U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul’s wealth in remarks to the Democrats with Disabilities caucus at the Texas Democratic State Convention in Corpus Christi. The Austin lawyer "is the sixth-richest person in Congress," Ankrum said Friday. We scurried to check. When we followed up with Ankrum, he immediately said he should have described McCaul as the sixth-richest member of the House — not all of Congress. How would Ankrum know? Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper, annually examines financial disclosure filings by members of Congress and ranks the 50 richest members by calculating their minimum net worths. On the disclosure filings, members don’t reveal exactly what they’re worth. Instead, they indicate assets and liabilities within broad categories such as $1 to $1,000, up to more than $50 million. Roll Call estimates each member’s net worth by calculating the lowest possible total assets and subtracting the lowest possible liabilities. According to Roll Call’s latest assessment, based on members’ 2008 submissions, McCaul was then the 11th-richest member of Congress, and the sixth-richest House member. McCaul’s estimated net worth that year: $38.08 million. The sixth-richest member that year, according to Roll Call’s research, was Rep. Jared Polis of Colorado, with an estimated net worth of $71 million. "McCaul’s assets grew by at least $14 million in 2008," Roll Call said, "a jump of nearly 60 percent from his reported minimum value the year before. McCaul holds the largest percentage increase in wealth among any member." Roll Call also reported that many lawmakers on its top-50 list had suffered steep financial losses, reporting a combined loss of more than $275 million from their combined estimated net worths in 2007. Roll Call said McCaul’s boost in wealth reflected a significant jump in some of his wife’s investments, which were valued at a minimum of $25 million. McCaul’s father-in-law is Lowry Mays, the founder of media giant Clear Channel Communications. We checked in with McCaul’s campaign, whose spokesman Mike Rosen, didn’t quibble with the ranking. Overall, 28 Democrats and 22 Republicans made the publication’s top-50 list. The most flush member of Congress that year was Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., with an estimated net worth of $167.55 million. Other Texans in the money: U.S. Rep. Kenny Marchant, R-Irving, ranked 25th with an estimated net worth of $11.89 million, Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, came in 35th at $7.14 million and Rep. Randy Neugebauer, R-Lubbock, landed 46th at $5.91 million. Summing up (ahem): Ankrum misspoke because McCaul, by the latest ranking, is the the sixth-richest member of the House, not Congress. Still, the punch line is about the same; McCaul was better off than most colleagues. We rate Ankrum’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-00245	Says a bill co-sponsored by Sen. Claire McCaskill "would give a free pass to any illegal immigrant who brings a child to the border."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/06/josh-hawley/hawley-misconstrues-mccaskills-support-keep-famili/	Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley and outside groups supporting his campaign have criticized Sen. Claire McCaskill for her views on immigration during their Senate race. A recent salvo in this subtext of their contest comes from Hawley in the form of an op-ed for FoxNews.com. "…now she (McCaskill) is sponsoring the most radical open-border bill ever introduced in Congress," Hawley wrote. "Her bill was written by California liberal Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, and it would give a free pass to any illegal immigrant who brings a child to the border." Hawley is referring to the Keep Families Together Act, which would bar family separations except if the child is at risk of trafficking and abuse by parents or guardians. Kelli Ford, the Hawley campaign’s press secretary, said that Hawley’s "free pass" comments meant that if you are an immigrant coming here illegally with a child, this bill would let you enter into the United States. With immigration becoming a wedge issue between McCaskill and Hawley, we spoke to experts and consulted the text of the bill to determine the accuracy of Hawley’s assertion. Hawley’s explanation Ford pointed to the language of the bill from Section 2(a), which, in her words, "tells agents/officers that they can’t remove a child from a parent/legal guardian within the 100-mile limit" of the United States. That’s true — with exceptions. Border officials could separate if the child is a victim of trafficking or at significant risk of it; if there's a strong likelihood that the adult is not the parent; or if the child is in danger of abuse or neglect. State courts and state or county child welfare agencies can also separate families if it's in the child's best interest. Finally, Ford pointed to an excerpt from the bill that says children can’t be removed from guardians "solely for the policy goal of deterring individuals from migrating to the United States or for the policy goal of promoting compliance with civil immigration laws." Expert consensus Hawley’s depiction of the Keeping Families Together Act is incorrect, experts said. "The bill would not grant illegal immigrants a ‘pass’ — free or otherwise — to enter or live legally or illegally in the United States," David Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute think tank wrote in an email. "It would only prohibit the separation of children from their parents who come to the border unless the child is a victim of trafficking or abuse." Bier went on to write that the bill does not forbid the removal of parents who are undocumented immigrants from the U.S., meaning it does not change existing immigration law, nor does it seek to make it easier for such parents or guardians to stay in the U.S. Leon Fresco, an immigration attorney based in Washington, D.C., put his objections to Hawley’s claim simply: "Nothing in this bill prevents the removal of a family unit in its entirety." The bill does not block families from being detained together, said Fresco, a former deputy assistant attorney general who drafted the Senate’s comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013. While Fresco understands the reasoning behind thinking it’s wrong to "prevent the government from prosecuting an adult for crossing the border illegally if they bring their child," that is not what this proposed law would do. "It only prevents the separation of the adult and the child," Fresco wrote. The bill does not put forth safeguards for immigrants without documentation; adults can still be prosecuted. Matt Barreto, UCLA professor of political science and Chicana/o studies, was adamant in his disagreement with Hawley’s conclusion about the bill: "It absolutely does not do that." "It just blocks DHS/CBP from taking children away from their parents," Barreto wrote in an email. "People still have to go through all the normal procedures for asylum, refugee or immigration." The Hawley campaign pointed out that Barreto’s firm Latino Decisions did polling work for the Hillary Clinton campaign. Our ruling Hawley said McCaskill backed a bill that "would give a free pass to any illegal immigrant who brings a child to the border." The bill in question takes no such measure. Undocumented immigrants are not afforded any new protections from prosecution under the bill; it seeks to stop the separation of immigrant children from their families or guardians. The thinking behind Hawley’s charge against McCaskill has been echoed by Republican officials throughout the country. That doesn’t make it more right. We rate the statement False. Update, Oct. 6, 11:30p.m.: The article has been updated to add context to two sources, Leon Fresco and Matt Barreto.

pomt-08918	People in the top tax bracket, "these so-called wealthy, most of them are small-business owners."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/27/stephen-hayes/so-called-wealthy-are-actually-small-business-owne/	Across-the-board tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush are set to expire at the end of the year, stoking the political debate over tax policy. President Barack Obama campaigned on the position that lower tax rates should only be extended for single people who make less than $200,000 a year, or couples who make less than $250,000. Republicans, on the other hand, want the lower tax rates to stay in place for everyone. One of the arguments Republicans use to support tax cuts for the wealthy is that most are small business owners. Conservative pundit Stephen Hayes made the case on ABC News' This Week, after U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner affirmed the Obama administration's commitment to raising taxes on high earners. "The people that we're talking about, these so-called wealthy, most of them are small-business owners," Hayes said. "So if you're talking about cutting taxes for people who can put people back to work, that's who you're talking about." It's certainly more politically palatable to urge lower taxes for mom-and-pop business owners than for Wall Street fat cats. But is it true that most of the rich are small business owners? We fact-checked similar claims during the 2008 election, so we're familiar with the sources that both sides use to argue this point. The basis for Hayes' claim comes from details gleaned from Internal Revenue Service data. The U.S. Treasury Department found in 2007 that many of the wealthiest tax filers report some type of non-wage income, such as income from a sole proprietorship, a partnership or an S corporation. (An S corporation is simply a corporation that chooses to pass corporate income, losses, deductions and credit through to their shareholders for federal tax purposes.) The Treasury Department estimated that 75 percent of tax payers in the top bracket reported this type of income. Does this mean that all those wealthy taxpayers were small business owners? Probably not. This kind of income could be reported from anyone who earned money from a source other than a regular job, such as consulting or public speaking. It could also be reported by those who make most of their income from partnerships, such as law firms and medical practices. And it could include investors who have little involvement in the day-to-day operations of a company. It's impossible to know how many of these high earners are what most people think of as small business owners. One indication, however, might be if these wealthy taxpayers reported that most of their income was from this business-type income. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center analyzed IRS data in March 2009, looking to see how many wealthy tax filers could say that half of their income or more came from business income. The center found that, among the wealthiest filers -- the top 1 percent -- only 25 percent earned more than half their income from business-type income. The percentages for non-wage income were even smaller among taxpayers earning less. (Editor's note: After we initially published this item, the Tax Policy Center released a new analysis looking at business income by tax bracket. They found that in the top bracket, only 32.5 percent earned more than half their income that way.) Hayes defended his statement in an e-mail to PolitiFact. While he conceded that not every tax filer who reports business income is a small business owner, he said he found the 50 percent cut-off for defining owners arbitrary. "I can see not counting as a 'small business owner' someone who makes $500,000 in from an employer and $2,000 in small business income. And if we included all of those people the number would be comfortably above 'most' among the top earners. So reasonable people can disagree about where to draw that line. But it seems odd that we would not count as a 'small business owner' someone who owns a small business that generates 49 percent of her overall income," he said. There's one final point we want to clarify here for our readers, because we've been asked about this before: If you are a small business owner yourself, you would have to be a whiz running a very profitable small business to get hit with a tax increase under the plan Obama supports. You would have to report total income of more than $200,000 (or $250,000 for couples) after all your business expenses were deducted. You may remember this being a key point during the Joe the Plumber debate during the 2008 campaign when Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher said to then candidate Obama, "I'm getting ready to buy a company that makes 250 to 280 thousand dollars a year. Your new tax plan's going to tax me more, isn't it?" Back then, the Tax Policy Center analyzed all taxpayers, of any income level, who report these types of business income. They found only about 2 percent of them would see tax increases if the government increased the rates on the top earners. So the vast majority of possible small business owners would not see a tax increase if the Bush tax cuts expire for those in the top incomes. In conclusion, do many wealthy tax payers report types of business income that might be from owning a small business? Sure. But it's impossible to tell how many meet the definition of what most of us think of when we think of small business owners. Other data indicate that among all tax payers who might be small business owners, most would not see taxes go up if the Bush tax cuts for the highest earners are allowed to expire. Hayes said that "these so-called wealthy, most of them are small-business owners." We rate that statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Stephen Hayes	None	None	None	2010-07-27T16:23:31	2010-07-25	['None']

pomt-11360	"Breaking! Terrorist attacks Trumps at Mar A Lago."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/03/trump-talks/misleading-headline-says-terrorist-attack-trump-pr/	An alarmist headline on Facebook went too far in describing what happened in South Florida while President Donald Trump and his family celebrated Easter weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate. "Breaking! Terrorist attacks Trumps at Mar A Lago -- police on scene," said an April 2 headline on The Trump Talks, a pro-Trump website. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found that what actually happened at a Trump property in Palm Beach County was an act of vandalism, not terrorism. The story described those who oppose Trump as "turning to threats of physical violence." "Now, over this holiday weekend, President Trump and his family had an urgent situation unfold that had the police rushing to the scene, and has everyone wondering when the violence will end?" the story said. But after several paragraphs, what the story then described wasn’t actually violence -- and it wasn’t at Mar-a-Lago but at the nearby Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. The Trump Talks cites a Local 10 TV news report about what actually happened: Red paint was splattered on the Trump International Golf Club sign on the night of March 31. Trump had spent several hours at the golf course earlier in the day. Multiple news reports said that the U.S. Secret Service and the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office were investigating. News accounts described the incident as vandalism. We didn’t get much information about the incident from either entity. A Secret Service spokesman referred PolitiFact to the sheriff’s office, and a spokeswoman for the sheriff’s office referred PolitiFact to the Secret Service because it is the lead investigative agency.

pomt-09539	"Florida still averages more students in its classrooms than any other state in the Southeast."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/feb/06/franklin-sands/florida-democrat-says-state-last-among-southeast-s/	After spending almost $16 billion to implement Florida's voter-approved plan to reduce class sizes, Gov. Charlie Crist and the Republican Legislature are now talking about reining it in. But a leading Democrat says the idea would leave the state not much else than a big bill to show for the investment. "I am hesitant of the governor's call for changing the class-size amendment in the state Constitution," House Democratic Leader Franklin Sands of Weston said in a press release on Jan. 29, 2010. "I seriously doubt that Floridians will want to undo what they approved in 2002. I strongly support giving school districts the flexibility they need to deal with small increases in the student-teacher ratios. But it is important to remember that Florida still averages more students in its classrooms than any other state in the Southeast." We wondered if Sands' claim, that Florida averages more students per classrooms than other states in the Southeast, is right. First, some background. In November 2002, Florida voters passed a constitutional amendment that sets limits for how many students are allowed per class starting in the 2010-11 school year. The limits are subdivided by grades K-3, 4-8 and 9-12: no more than 18 students for grades K-3, no more than 22 students for grades 4-8 and no more than 25 students for grades 9-12. In 2003, the state started to slowly implement the changes. First, classroom reductions were measured at the school district average, then at the school average. In the fall, districts are scheduled to meet the new limits in every classroom. But Crist and some prominent state legislators have suggested freezing the class-size reduction program at the school average rather than investing more money. (The state Department of Education says reducing class sizes further would cost an additional $3.2 billion.) A recent state report suggests almost 235,000 classrooms in 2,769 schools across Florida would fall short if the amendment were fully implemented in the fall. In contrast, only a small percentage of schools have not met the requirements of a schoolwide average. Districts face possible financial penalties in the millions if they fall short. Back to Sands' claim. His office pointed us to the National Center for Education Statistics, part of the U.S. Department of Education, which is considered a primary source on education statistics and research. States submit annual data to NCES, which then calculates enrollment and teacher statistics. The most recent data available is from the 2007-08 school year, said Patrick Keaton, a researcher with the group. Data from the 2008-09 school year is due out this spring, he said. Using teacher and enrollment data, NCES calculates a pupil/teacher ratio. Florida, in 2007-2008, had 15.8 students for every classroom teacher, the NCES reported. That is more than Alabama (14.8), Arkansas (14.1), Georgia (14.1), Kentucky (15.3), Louisiana (14), Mississippi (14.7), North Carolina (14), South Carolina (15), and Tennessee (14.9), according to the NCES. Now Sands said in the "Southeast" -- which isn't a region defined by the U.S. government and has subjective boundaries. If, for instance, Virginia fits your definition of Southeast, it had a higher pupil/teacher ratio in 2007-08 (17.1) than Florida (15.8), the NCES found. If you consider Texas or West Virginia in the Southeast, each has a pupil/teacher ratio lower than Florida's. Among the 50 states, Florida was tied for 35th with respect to pupil/teacher ratio in 2007-08, according to the NCES. Another important distinction: Sands said Florida "averages" more students in its classrooms when compared to other states. But average class size and pupil/teacher ratios are not equivalent, said Alan Richard, with the Southern Regional Education Board, a nonpartisan group that helps 16 member states create education policy. Class size measures the number of students in a class, most often core math, science and English classes -- while pupil/teacher ratios take the number of students in all types of classes and divide by the number of teachers. Put another way, if 30 high school juniors were in an English class and 10 high school juniors were in an art class, the calculation for class size would likely be 30 but the calculation for pupil/teacher ratio would be 20. Not all states calculate average class size. (At least Tennessee and Kentucky don't, education officials in those states confirmed.) Back to what Sands said: His broader point -- that Florida has more students in its classrooms than other states -- is largely true, as measured by pupil/teacher ratios. But Sands said "Florida still averages more students in its classrooms than any other state in the Southeast," and there are at least three caveats to his statement: Use of the word "still" implies currently, but Sands is relying on 2-year-old data to make his claim. (We tried to calculate 2008-09 pupil/teacher ratios ourselves using state enrollment and teacher data. While Florida's position didn't change among the states we were able to collect information from, we can't say unequivocally that Florida ranks last.) Sands is slightly misrepresenting the NCES calculation. Though speaking about average class sizes, he refers to a report measuring pupil-to-teacher ratios, which can be different. And then there's a question on what states are included in the Southeast. If Virginia is included, Florida ranks second. In our minds, that's enough asterisks to knock Sands' statement to Half True.

pomt-11266	Says Mitt Romney is using "a million of his presidential campaign dollars to finance his Utah Senate race."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/27/jenny-wilson/yes-1-million-mitt-romneys-failed-white-house-bid-/	A Democratic candidate for Utah’s U.S. Senate seat claimed Republican opponent Mitt Romney is using $1 million of leftover donations to his unsuccessful presidential run to finance his Senate bid. "The former Governor of Massachusetts is taking yet another short cut to the Utah Senate Seat," Nickie Titus, campaign manager for Democrat Jenny Wilson, said in a press release. "Mitt certainly does things his way — moves to Utah from California (and) uses a million of his presidential campaign dollars to finance his Utah senate race." It turns out Wilson’s campaign is right: Romney is using $1 million from his failed presidential bid to fuel his Senate campaign. Experts told us this is common in politics, though the practice has come under criticism. Campaign fund-shifting Romney’s failure to reach the White House in 2008 and 2012 is not without a silver lining. It elevated Romney’s public stature, gave him staying power in Republican politics and left him with a substantial — and flexible — bankroll. Campaign finance rules have long allowed a candidate to hold on to surplus campaign funds indefinitely, said Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist at the group Public Citizen, a progressive consumer rights advocacy group. Under the Federal Election Campaign Act and Federal Election Commission rules, candidates can also make unlimited transfers of funds between campaigns, Holman said. "It happens all the time," said Michael J. Malbin, the executive director of the Campaign Finance Institute, a campaign finance policy think tank. "House members take their bankrolls to run for the Senate, senators to run for president. As long as the money was raised for a federal office under federal contribution limits, it's okay." Holman argued just because the practice is widespread doesn’t mean it’s fair. He said the policy can create an uneven playing field and permits candidates to use funds in a way that’s contrary to donors’ intentions. "A donor may have supported Romney’s presidential campaign against the Democratic nominee, but not support Romney’s new campaign for Senate in the primary or general election," Holman said. "Yet, under the law, Romney has the authority to use those donors’ funds without getting their approval." Romney followed suit At the beginning of 2018, Romney for President, Inc., the nonprofit organization that supported Romney’s failed 2012 presidential bid, had roughly $1.3 million cash on hand. On Feb. 5, the organization transferred $1 million to Romney for Utah, Inc., according to an FEC filing. To the chagrin of Romney’s opponents, the transfer from Romney’s presidential campaign to his Senate run comprises donations made mostly by non-Utah residents, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. "The $1 million is indicative of what we’re seeing from Mitt Romney. He’s bringing in national money to make this a national-profile race," Wilson told the Tribune. "I’m a Utahn running for Utahns." The April 15, 2018, FEC filing, which covered the first three months of the year, shows the organization also made smaller disbursements for consulting work, email services and bank fees. At the end of the reporting period, Romney for President, Inc., had $222,755 cash on hand. Our ruling Wilson’s campaign said Romney is using "a million of his presidential campaign dollars to finance his Utah senate race." The nonprofit organization that collected money for Romney’s 2012 campaign transferred $1 million to Romney’s bid for Utah’s Senate seat. We rate this True.

pomt-11021	"More than 66% of ALL births in California are to illegals on Medi-Cal."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/05/viral-image/viral-image-overstates-births-undocumented-mothers/	A viral image on social media -- one that’s critical of illegal immigration -- has been circulating for years. The list of claims first circulated in the form of a chain email in 2006, according to Snopes.com. Six years later, we checked several of the claims ourselves. With immigration in the headlines today, these claims are popular again. In this article, we’ll fact-check No. 4: "More than 66% of ALL births in California are to illegals on Medi-Cal." Medi-Cal is the name of California’s Medicaid program, which covers low-income residents of the state. Undocumented immigrants may be eligible for health plan options through Medi-Cal, although the benefits may be limited. The most recent complete data we found was from 2011. That year, the state had 502,120 total births. According to Medi-Cal, 50.4 percent of the state’s births that year were paid for by Medi-Cal. That works out to 253,068 total births on Medi-Cal. Medi-Cal also reported that 29 percent of Medi-Cal mothers in 2011 were undocumented. So that year, 73,390 undocumented mothers gave birth on Medi-Cal. As a percentage of all births in the state, that works out to about 15 percent -- not 66 percent, as the meme says. After we initially published this article, a spokeswoman for California's Department of Health Care Services provided statistics for 2012 and 2013. As it turns out, the percentage declined in those years -- to 13.4 percent in 2012 and 12.6 percent in 2013. In its previous review of these claims, Snopes evaluated an earlier version of the assertion that was worded, "Over 2/3’s of all births in Los Angeles County are to illegal alien Mexicans on Medi-Cal whose births were paid for by taxpayers." So we looked at the data for Los Angeles in 2013, the most recent year we could find on the California Department of Public Health website. That doesn’t support the earlier version of the claim either. That year, about 57 percent of births to residents of Los Angeles were Hispanic. But that refers to all Hispanic births -- not just those to undocumented immigrants, who accounted for only a fraction of the total Hispanic population. Our ruling The meme says, "More than 66% of ALL births in California are to illegals on Medi-Cal." That’s wrong. Between 2011 and 2013, the most recent years available, between 12 percent and 15 percent of all births statewide were to undocumented immigrants using Medicaid, not 66 percent. We rate the statement False. UPDATE, July 5, 7:00 p.m.: This article has been updated with the most recent figures provided by California's Department of Health Care Services.

pomt-05345	Florida has "1,200 golf courses. I think 58 million rounds played a year in Florida. We’ve got 44 percent of all travel golf in the country here. 5 million people come here just for golf."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/may/11/rick-scott/rick-scott-talks-floridas-golfing-creds-ahead-play/	Gov. Rick Scott considers himself Florida’s promoter-in-chief. So it makes sense that he would use a TV interview on the opening day of the Players Championship at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach to show off just how important golf is to Florida. "Golf is big for the state," Scott told Action News Jacksonville on May 10, 2012. "1,200 golf courses. I think it’s 58 million rounds of golf played a year in Florida. … We’ve got 44 percent of all the travel golf in the country here. 5 million people come to Florida just for golf. It’s big business. It creates a lot of jobs." Look, we’re not all politics all the time. We like to unwind and embrace our Florida side, too. We decided some golf-related research was in order. There’s no doubt the sport is huge for Florida. Experts we consulted agree it’s the No. 1 destination for golf in the world. Scott received this information from a 2004 National Golf Foundation report, spokesman Lane Wright said. We tried to get a copy but couldn’t locate one. Scott is mostly on the mark with his statements, but we found some rough patches that we’ll explain one by one. 1,200 golf courses: Scott is close. Play Florida, the state’s golf marketing program, puts the number of facilities a little lower, at 1,056. Did you catch how we used "facilities" instead of "courses"? That’s because one facility may have multiple courses. Take the Innisbrook Golf Resort in Palm Harbor, which has four courses but counts as one facility. For that reason, the real number of courses is probably higher than 1,200, but "that’s the number we use," said Gary Jones, who manages Play Florida. 58 million rounds played a year: The number of rounds played each year is the barometer of the popularity of golf, said Tom Stine, co-founder of Golf Datatech, which conducts market research for the industry. It seems the governor caught wind of some expired talking points. The number of rounds was 59 million in 2000, according to a University of Florida study. In 2011, the number of rounds was 41 million, Stine said. That’s a slight uptick from 2010, but it still trails the annual number of rounds before the recession set in, which is probably where Scott is drawing his number, he said. Round counts are up for 2012 in Florida and the country, he said. The reason is lots of sunny weather nationwide -- good news for golf lovers but bad for people who prefer skis. Florida gets 44 percent of all travel golf in the country: This is the hardest one to track down. Stine said he doesn’t know what Scott means here, and that he’s skeptical all the golf in California, the Carolinas, Georgia, Arizona, Texas, and Michigan (in the summer) comprises just 56 percent of "travel golf." "It’s one of those numbers if you don’t attach the methodology for it, how in the heck do you know what that means?" Stine said. Jones also couldn’t be sure. "I can tell you that it’s over 40 percent," he said, citing a university study he could not find by our deadline. If we get more information on this point, we'll update our report. 5 million people come here just for golf: Scott is close here but misses a distinction between the two types of out-of-state golfers, Jones said. On one hand, there are visitors who come to Florida just to play golf. There are about 1.5 million of these people, Jones said. They play an average of 5.2 rounds. Then there are "amenity golfers" who come to Florida for reasons other than playing golf but fit it in anyway. Think of fathers making a break for it on an Orlando family vacation. Jones estimates there are 3.6 million of these golfers, which play an average of 1.2 rounds. Combining these out-of-state golfers (1.5 million + 3.6 million) amounts to 5.1 million people. A chunk of these people, though, came to Florida for other reasons, which isn’t exactly what Scott said. Our ruling Golf is a big deal for the Sunshine State -- and now we know that more rays equal more rounds. Still, Scott needs to finesse his points before getting our hole-in-one rating.

pomt-06255	Says Mitt Romney flip-flopped on a taxpayer protection pledge.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/29/democratic-national-committee/dnc-ad-says-mitt-romney-flip-flopped-taxpayer-pled/	On Nov. 28, 2011, the Democratic National Committee released two videos designed to paint Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney as a serial flip-flopper. The shorter, 30-second version gives a taste of the attack, specifically citing abortion and health care, and directs viewers to a website with a four-minute version that offers alleged flip-flops on a variety of other issues. For this item, we’ll check one of the claims from the four-minute version -- specifically, whether Romney has changed his position on signing a taxpayer protection pledge. We're looking at other aspects of the ad in separate items. Here’s the relevant portion from the DNC ad: Screen text: Will not sign pledge Audio of Candy Crowley: "Republican Mitt Romney says he will not sign a no-new-taxes pledge." Screen text: Then he did Audio from Romney radio ad: "I’m proud to be the only major candidate for president to sign the tax pledge." The first clip refers to an announcement during Romney’s 2002 gubernatorial campaign that he would not sign a pledge circulated by Citizens for Limited Taxation, a Massachusetts-based anti-tax group. Here’s how the Boston Globe covered the news: "In a break with Acting Governor Jane Swift and her GOP predecessors, Republican gubernatorial candidate Mitt Romney is refusing to rule out tax increases and said yesterday he will not sign a ‘no new taxes’ pledge," the newspaper wrote. "Romney said that while he opposes all tax increases in principle, he will not make such a pledge in writing." The article went on to quote Romney saying, "I am not in favor of increasing taxes. … At this stage, I am inclined to make that position as clear as I can but not to enter into a written pledge of some kind, and that's true on this and other issues." The Globe cited another comment by Romney that had been reported by the Union-News of Springfield, Mass. "I'm against tax increases," Romney told attendees of Western Massachusetts GOP meeting, according to the Union-News. "But I'm not intending to, at this stage, sign a document which would prevent me from being able to look specifically at the revenue needs of the Commonwealth." Barbara Anderson, an official with Citizens for Limited Taxation, was unhappy with Romney's refusal to sign, which came after he’d met with her for half an hour. "He's thinking like an independent businessman who doesn't sign pledges," she suggested to the Globe. Meanwhile, the Boston Herald quoted then Romney deputy campaign manager Eric Fehrnstrom saying, "Mitt Romney doesn't have to sign a piece of paper to have a position on an issue. He's pledged to oppose any tax increase, he doesn't support them, his position on taxes is clear." In an interview with the Globe, Fehrnstrom was even more dismissive, calling the pledge "government by gimmickry," the newspaper reported. Put it all together and you have a candidate who didn’t just decide against signing a pledge but who cast doubt on the propriety of such pledges in general. Now we’ll fast-forward a few years, when Romney, having finished a term as governor of Massachusetts, was running for president. On Dec. 31, 2006, Romney became the first major candidate for the 2008 election to sign a taxpayer protection pledge offered by Americans for Tax Reform, the anti-tax group headed by Grover Norquist. "In signing the pledge, Gov. Romney firmly commits himself in writing to fiscal discipline and economic common sense," Norquist said in a news release. "Mitt Romney has told taxpayers in no uncertain terms that he plans to look out for their interests." Romney hardly signed the Norquist pledge covertly. On Jan. 4, 2007, he issued a press release touting his action, and on Oct. 5, 2007, he released a radio ad spotlighting it. That’s where the DNC got the clip used in its ad. "For years, conservative candidates for president signed their name on the dotted line pledging to oppose tax increases," Romney said in the ad. "I'm Mitt Romney. I'm proud to be the only major candidate for president to sign the tax pledge. The others have not. I signed the tax pledge because I want everyone to know where I stand. We've got to get taxes down and grow our economy. I believe it's not fair that you have to pay taxes when you earn your money, when you save your money and when you die. That's why I'll kill the death tax once and for all and roll back tax rates across the board. And savings? When I'm president, for every middle class American, the new tax rate on your interest, dividends, and capital gains will be absolutely zero. I stood firm to roll back taxes as governor. I'll roll back taxes as president." In this case, then, Romney not only signed a written pledge but actively broadcast it to the electorate. It’s worth noting that the two pledges are not exactly the same. One addressed the state context and one the federal context. The Massachusetts text is a "pledge to ... all the people of this state, that I will oppose and vote against any and all efforts to increase taxes." The Norquist pledge, to which Romney is still a signatory, requires the signer to "oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses … and oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates." Still, despite the differences in wording, we think the pledges are equivalent in their underlying requirements. Our ruling In 2002, Romney refused to make "a pledge in writing" on taxes. Four years later, he signed one and touted it as a selling point for his candidacy. In our book, that’s a clear flip-flop. We rate the DNC’s charge True.

pomt-04776	Says U.S. Senate rival Tammy Baldwin wants a "completely government-controlled" health care system that goes "far beyond 'Obamacare'" and is "a Medicare system for all."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/aug/26/tommy-thompson/tommy-thompson-says-us-senate-rival-tammy-baldwin-/	A day after winning the Republican primary for U.S. Senate, former Wisconsin governor Tommy Thompson used health care to contrast himself with his opponent in the general election, U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, D-Madison. In the Aug. 15, 2012 interview with Vicki McKenna, a conservative radio talk show host based at WIBA-AM (1310) in Madison, Thompson declared: "Tammy Baldwin, who is a nice lady, but believes philosophically that she wants a health care system that is completely government controlled. She did not think 'Obamacare' went far enough. She was far beyond 'Obamacare.' She wants a Medicare system for all, in which the government makes all the decisions for your health care system." We rated Mostly True a Thompson claim that Baldwin is the most liberal member of the House. But with polls indicating most Americans want to repeal Obama’s federal health reform law, does Baldwin really want to go further? To a "completely government-controlled" health care system that provides Medicare not only for people over 65 but for everyone? Health reform terms As we begin, it’s important to look at key terms connected to health care reform and Obama’s reform law. These definitions are from the Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent organization that analyzes the health care system. Universal care: A system that provides health coverage to all people through measures such as an individual mandate or a single-payer system. Individual mandate: A requirement that all individuals obtain health insurance. Single-payer: A health care system in which the government pays for health care services, but is not involved in the delivery of health care. Public option: An insurance plan administered and funded by the government that would be offered along with private insurance plans. Obama’s health reform law The health reform that Obama signed into law in 2010 law significantly increases government regulation of health insurers and includes an individual mandate for nearly all Americans. (During the primary campaign we rated False a claim by Thompson, who supports repealing Obama’s reform law, that he never supported a mandate.) Under the reform law, as PolitiFact National has reported, employers will continue providing health insurance to most Americans and, overall, more people will get private health coverage. And it goes without saying that the reform law doesn’t take the European approach, where the government owns the hospitals and the doctors are public employees; nor the Canadian universal-single payer approach, in which no private insurance is allowed. Baldwin’s position Now, let’s look at Baldwin, who was elected to the House in 1998, and see how she stands on these key points: Universal care: Baldwin has long advocated providing health insurance for everyone. In 1999, Baldwin spoke at a Washington, D.C. rally for the "Universal Health Care 2000 (U2K)" movement. In a news release about the event, she said she was one of the few politicians who ran for office in 1998 "who dared to make ‘health care for all’ the focus of her campaign for Congress." Baldwin also announced that Wisconsin could be one of 10 states to receive grants to develop suggestions for a "federal-state partnership to provide health coverage for all of their citizens." (Interestingly, the announcement was made with Thompson at the governor’s office in Madison, the release said.) In 2000, Baldwin introduced the Health Security for All Americans Act, which would have required states to provide universal coverage. The bill died without a House vote, as it did Baldwin after reintroduced it in 2002, 2004 and 2005. Single-payer: Baldwin tried to get the government more involved in health care by making it the sole payer of health care services. In 2009, on the day the House Energy and Commerce Committee voted for Obama’s reform law, Baldwin said: "I am one of the members of this committee who believes strongly that a single-payer health system is the best way to comprehensively and fairly reform our health care system." That version of Obama’s measure didn’t include the single-payer element, but Baldwin said she had "played a role in securing a commitment that a single-payer health care alternative will receive consideration by the full House of Representatives." So, in pushing single-payer, Baldwin would go beyond Obama’s law. Public option: Baldwin advocates for the federal government offering health insurance along with private insurers. Baldwin said she hoped a public option in Obama’s law would lead to single-payer. The version of Obama’s measure that Baldwin voted for in 2009 included the public option, but the final version did not. Baldwin continues to advocate for going further than the Obama reform law does. On her official House website, Baldwin says her "driving motivation in politics is to pass legislation that will guarantee health care for all in America." She also says that the reform law "is not perfect, and I will continue to work to improve it as it is phased in over the next four years. In particular, I strongly believe that allowing Americans the choice of a public option is essential." Now, to the third part of Thompson’s claim, that Baldwin supports "Medicare for all." Thompson campaign spokesman Brian Nemoir pointed out that Baldwin was one of several dozen co-sponsors of the Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act, which has been introduced several times during her tenure. It would have provided universal care by creating a national health insurance program and prohibiting private insurers from selling coverage that duplicates benefits in the program. Susan Giaimo, a visiting political science professor at Marquette University in Milwaukee, whose specialties include health care politics and policy, told us the government would have had a lot of clout in negotiating prices with health care providers under the bill. It’s not clear whether "Medicare for all" would get rid of private health insurance, but private health care providers would remain, she said. And it doesn’t go as far as the British model of "socialized medicine," with the government owning hospitals and employing the health care workers, she said. A final note: Thompson and other Republicans like to cite a clip from a speech Baldwin made at a September 2010 political rally in which she said, chuckling: "I actually was for a government takeover of medicine. I was for a single-payer plan." Baldwin actually was criticizing those who called Obama’s reform law a "government takeover" (which PolitiFact chose as its lie of the year for 2010). But she did go on to say she wanted to go further than the reform law does: "I was for a single-payer plan and that isn’t, as we know, what we ended up with, but I also think what we ended up with was incredible progress for the American people." Our rating Thompson said Baldwin wants a "completely government-controlled" health care system that goes "far beyond 'Obamacare'" and is "a Medicare system for all." Baldwin hasn’t hasn’t advocated for socialized medicine. But she has pushed "Medicare for all" legislation and she supports single payer and the public option, government elements that go beyond Obama’s reform law. On balance, we rate Thompson’s statement Mostly True.	None	Tommy Thompson	None	None	None	2012-08-26T09:00:00	2012-08-15	['Tammy_Baldwin', 'Medicare_(United_States)', 'United_States']

pomt-07384	Says that had E-Verify been in place in Florida when 9/11 terrorists lived here, "we might have saved the lives of 3,000 Americans."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2011/may/03/john-thrasher/sen-john-thrasher-says-e-verify-couldve-prevented-/	Republican Sen. John Thrasher came to the state Senate floor on May 3, 2011, to try to put teeth back into a watered-down immigration bill. The bill -- which has been one of the more controversial of the 2011 legislative session -- had been stripped of a requirement that private employers use the federal E-Verify system to check a worker's immigration status. Rather than try to restore the mandate, Thrasher instead tried to offer employers a strong incentive to voluntarily use the system. Use it, or risk being fined. Thrasher's amendment would have created noncriminal fines for employers who are found to have employed a nondocumented worker and had not screened that employee through the E-Verify system. Thrasher explained that the employer would receive fines escalating from $500 to $1,500 for multiple instances of hiring illegal workers. Several Republicans opposed the amendment, which ultimately failed 23-16, but not before Thrasher tried to sway votes by saying E-Verify could have prevented the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. During his closing argument, Thrasher reminded people that the United States had -- after 10 years and millions and millions of dollars -- found and killed 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden on May 1, 2011. "I want to remind everyone in here that 10 of the 19 terrorists who attacked our country, directed by Osama bin Laden in doing that, lived in the state of Florida," Thrasher said. "I wish we would have had the E-Verify system. ... We might have saved the lives of 3,000 Americans. Matt Dixon of the Florida Times-Union spoke with Thrasher after his comments and asked for him to clarify his statement. Thrasher said that "several of them (the hijackers) had jobs," and might have been flagged by the E-Verify system. He also said that an earlier version of the bill had stronger requirements for law enforcement officials to use E-Verify and might have helped catch the 9/11 plotters. A staggering claim about E-Verify and 9/11. But true? First, the E-Verify system is a federal database that compares information from a person's employment paperwork to the Department of Homeland Security and Social Security records. Employers use the program to weed out immigrants not eligible to work in this country. Once employers hire workers, they run their names through the E-Verify database. If the records match, the new employees are eligible to work. If they don't match, the database notifies the employers, who must then give the workers eight days to provide sufficient proof of eligibility. A pilot program of what is now the E-Verify system launched in 1997 in several states -- including Florida -- and the program expanded to all 50 states by 2004. In 2004, 3,500 employers were authorized the system. More than 200,000 employers are now registered to use E-Verify. As for the 9/11 terrorists, Thrasher actually understates the connection to Florida. At least 14 of the 19 hijackers either spent time in Florida, or had Florida driver's licenses or identification cards. Among the people living in Florida were Mohammed Atta, who piloted American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston into the World Trade Center's north tower; Marwan al-Shehhi, who piloted United Airlines Flight 175 from Boston into the World Trade Center's south tower; and Ziad Samir Jarwan, the pilot of United Flight 93, which crashed in Pennsylvania. The three pilots received their pilot training in Florida. The question here, however, is if any of the hijackers could have been flagged by the E-Verify system. In order to do that, they would have needed to try to get a job. Other than one hijacker, Hani Hanjour, the 9/11 conspirators entered the United States legally by obtaining tourist visas. Hanjour used a student visa. It's important when considering Thrasher's claim because people entering the country on tourist visas are not allowed to work for U.S. employers. E-Verify or no E-Verify. And the majority of the hijackers, 13 of the 19, entered the country in the spring or summer of 2001, just months before the Sept. 11 attack. That means most of the hijackers would have been here for just a few months. Logic suggests they wouldn't have needed jobs. And in fact, they did not. The 9/11 Commission, the group formed to better understand the plot and how it could have been prevented, reported that the plotters spent somewhere between $400,000 and $500,000 to plan and conduct their attack, and that the money came directly from al-Qaida operatives. The commission concluded al-Qaida provided the hijackers "with nearly all of the money they needed to travel to the United States, train, and live." The money arrived either through wire transfers or cash, the commission concluded. Of all of the hijackers, there is evidence that only one actually worked for a U.S. employer. Nawaf Al-Hazmi, a hijacker on the plane that crashed into the Pentagon, did work at a San Diego-area Texaco station and car wash for about a month in early 2000. Al-Hazmi worked at minimum wage two days a week, vacuuming and drying cars, the Washington Post reported. Al-Hazmi's employment is corroborated in the 9/11 Commission's findings. Al-Hazmi was in the country on an expired tourist visa. And he is one of the hijackers with a Florida connection. Al-Hazmi obtained a Florida driver's license on June 25, 2001, in Palm Beach County. But that was more than a year after he worked briefly at the California gas station. To recap, Thrasher said: "I want to remind everyone in here that 10 of the 19 terrorists who attacked our country, directed by Osama bin Laden in doing that, lived in the state of Florida. I wish we would have had the E-Verify system ... we might have saved the lives of 3,000 Americans." Hijackers did live in Florida and obtain Florida driver's licenses. But in order to potentially be flagged by the E-Verify system, they would have had to work in the state. There is no record that any of them ever tried to get jobs here. And as such, E-Verify -- had it been used by Florida employers as Thrasher wanted -- wouldn't have found them or stopped their plotting. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-11328	Congressional Black Caucus introduces bill to "tax people for being white."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/11/international-news-trends/no-black-congressional-leaders-didnt-propose-tax-w/	A group of black congressional leaders want white people to pay up for being white, at least that’s what an online hoax would have you believe. "Congressional Black Caucus introduces bill: tax people for being white," said a March 23 headline on International News Trends blog, which attributed the information to the Blacksphere website. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The story misleads about a proposed bill related to studying reparations for African-Americans. The story links to a January 2017 by the Washington Examiner that stated the Congressional Black Caucus and other Democrats re-introduced legislation that would set up a commission to consider whether reparations should be paid to black Americans for slavery. The Examiner story never mentions the word "tax." The bill, H.R. 40, doesn’t mention a tax for white people. Rep. John Conyers Jr. D-Mich., proposed the bill repeatedly during the last two decades. "I’m not giving up," Conyers said in February 2017. "Slavery is a blemish on this nation’s history, and until it is formally addressed, our country’s story will remain marked by this blight." In December 2017, Conyers resigned amid sexual harassment allegations. He denied wrongdoing. A headline said that the "Congressional Black Caucus introduces bill: tax people for being white." The story cites a bill that calls for setting up a commission to consider reparations for slavery, but the bill doesn’t call for a tax on white people. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-06938	Says state Senate recall challenger Sandy Pasch voted "to cut school aid by nearly $300 million."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jul/20/club-growth/club-growth-wisconsin-ad-says-senate-recall-candid/	The target in one of the most competitive of Wisconsin’s nine Senate recall races is state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, an architect of a 2011-2013 state budget that reduces aid to public schools by nearly $800 million. But one of the state’s major political players, the conservative Club for Growth Wisconsin, is turning the tables. It claims Darling’s challenger, state Rep. Sandy Pasch, D-Whitefish Bay, also backed a sizable school funding cut. The attack is part of a radio ad that began airing about a week before Pasch won the Democratic primary. Club for Growth, which advocates for "limited government and minimal taxation," mostly branded Pasch as a tax-and-spender in the ad. But at one point, the female narrator says Pasch voted to "to cut school aid by nearly $300 million." Club for Growth also makes the school aid claim in similar ads that have targeted two other Assembly Democrats who are challenging incumbent Republicans in recall races, according to the La Crosse Tribune. They are Rep. Jennifer Shilling of La Crosse, running against Sen. Dan Kapanke of La Crosse; and Rep. Fred Clark of Baraboo, challenging Luther Olsen of Ripon. Those elections, and the Pasch-Darling contest, are on Aug. 9, 2011. When we asked for evidence to back the claim against Pasch, Club for Growth spokesman R. J. Johnson cited a May 2009 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article. It referred to the 2009-2011 budget submitted by then-Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat, which proposed cutting state aid for schools by $290 million. That was before the Legislature, then controlled by Democrats, voted on the budget. But a month later, Pasch joined all but two Assembly Democrats in approving the spending plan. The final budget cut general school aid by $294 million -- to $9.3 billion -- over two years, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. So, Club for Growth Wisconsin is correct in saying Pasch voted to cut school aid nearly $300 million. But is that whole story? In the same article cited by Club for Growth, Doyle said total spending on public schools would actually rise by about 5 percent because schools would get an additional $877 million in federal stimulus funds. That seemed to indicate that stimulus money would more than offset the state aid reduction. Gillian Morris, Pasch’s campaign spokeswoman, said that was also her understanding of what happened. But that was not the case. According to the fiscal bureau and the state Department of Public Instruction, the $294 million aid reduction took into account both the cut in state funds and the federal stimulus money that was added in. In other words, the stimulus money was not enough to offset the state funding cut. The net result for schools was a reduction in funding of $294 million. In sum, Club for Growth Wisconsin claimed that Pasch voted to cut nearly $300 million in aid to schools. The record shows the claim was on the mark. We rate the statement True.

pomt-03161	"Over the past twenty years, the number of homicides committed with a firearm in the United States has decreased by nearly 40 percent. The number of other crimes involving the use of a firearm has also plummeted, declining by nearly 70 percent."	true	/oregon/statements/2013/sep/07/doug-whitsett/have-gun-related-homicides-other-serious-crimes-de/	State Sen. Doug Whitsett recently took to the Internet to warn Oregonians that the Legislature was within a single vote of passing legislation that he said would have eroded the Second Amendment right to bear arms. We disagreed with Whitsett on the way he described the votes, in another fact check, but he said something else about gun-related homicides and crimes that we thought merited its own analysis: "Unfortunately, too many people are simply unaware of the facts regarding the possession of guns, and the commission of gun related crimes. In fact, most families have been convinced by media reports that gun related crimes are on the increase in America. That simply is not true! Over the past twenty years, the number of homicides committed with a firearm in the United States has decreased by nearly 40 percent. The number of other crimes involving the use of a firearm has also plummeted, declining by nearly 70 percent … … All indicators point to the fact that our society becomes safer as more responsible families own guns." We’ll be upfront: We have no idea if society is safer as a result of more responsible families owning guns. It’s not certain who owns firearms or how responsible they are. Also, some people would chalk up a decrease in firearm related homicides and crimes to better policing or to a decline in the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s, or to other factors. Others would add that we should look at suicide and other statistics to get a fuller picture of how to address firearms policy. For example, more than 30,000 people die from firearms a year, including suicide. There are too many variables and opinions to make a definitive statement on safety and guns and society. But what we can fact check are the statistics Whitsett cites. Has the number of homicides committed with a firearm decreased by nearly 40 percent in the last two decades? Are other crimes involving firearms down nearly 70 percent? The Republican state senator from Klamath Falls said he based his remarks on a Bureau of Justice Statistics report from May 2013, which used statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There were 11,101 firearm homicides in 2011, down from 18,253 in 1993, according to the BJS report. That is a 39 percent decline. Nonfatal crimes involving firearms declined 69 percent, from more than 1.5 million victims in 1993 to 467,300 victims in 2011. Those numbers back up Whitsett. The Pew Research Center released a separate report in May, also highlighting CDC numbers. It gives the same percentages and offers other calculations that back up the drops, including rates per 100,000 people. The Pew report noted that many Americans are unaware of the declines. The reports do not state definitive reasons for the decreases, but do point out that decreases were much steeper in the 1990s than in the 2000s. Apparently, 1993 was a peak year for homicides and the country has fared better since then. The numbers between 2000 and 2011 have gone up and down. Homicides and other violent crimes involving firearms have declined over the last two decades. Whitsett picked the numbers and years straight from a federal report issued in May, based on CDC statistics. The Pew Research Center, which is nonpartisan, used the same statistics. Readers can argue over what the declines mean, but they can’t take issue with the accuracy of his numbers. We rate the statement True.

pomt-06649	The premiums on Medicare’s prescription drug program have fallen almost every year since it began.	false	/georgia/statements/2011/sep/13/johnny-isakson/us-sen-isakson-claims-competition-driving-cost-med/	Free-market believers hold the concept as dearly as an article of faith: Competition brings down prices. So when U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, a Republican, declared that competition worked to bring down costs in Medicare’s prescription drug program, he was reciting chapter and verse from the free-market canon. Program premiums served as Isakson’s evidence. "The premium has gone down almost every year since it was put in place," Isakson said in a speech before the Greater North Fulton Chamber of Commerce on Aug. 23. Almost every year? We wondered how this was possible. What about all of those complaints about the rising costs of prescription drugs? Medicare Part D, which started in 2006, is Medicare’s program to help seniors pay for prescription drugs. Policymakers designed it to make private companies compete against one another for customers. They hoped this would pressure plans to keep prices low. Isakson voted to create Medicare Part D in 2003, while he served in the U.S. House of Representatives. This item does not address whether competition caused changes in the program’s premiums. Instead, we’ll focus on whether premiums went down. Now, hold on to your hat. This gets complicated. We contacted Isakson’s office for proof that the premium has fallen almost every year. Isakson press secretary Lauren Culbertson replied with a March 2011 report from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, or MedPac. It advises the U.S. Congress on issues affecting the Medicare program. She also included information from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, the federal agency that administers the Medicare program. These documents contain data for what’s called Medicare Part D’s "base beneficiary premium." The "base beneficiary premium" is a complicated number. It’s not the actual monthly amount that seniors pay to get basic coverage under the prescription drug program. Those amounts vary widely and seldom equal this figure, the CMS report notes. Medicare calculates the base beneficiary premium using a formula that takes many factors into account. One of them is how much each insurance company bids to provide drug coverage. Another is how many people use each plan. The data Isakson’s own staff sent us show that the base beneficiary premium actually increased almost every year, with the exceptions of 2007 and projections for 2012. In 2006, it was $32.20. In 2007, $27.35; in 2008, $27.93; in 2009, $30.36; in 2010, $31.94; in 2011, $32.34. In 2012, it’s projected to be $31.08. Boston University health care economist Wesley Yin called Isakson’s claim that the premiums mostly fell "patently wrong." Culbertson, in an email, told us why Isakson made this claim. She said that the senator’s comments were based on the fact that for every year except 2011, the base beneficiary premium was lower than it was in 2006. That’s not quite what we think Isakson said, but to give him the benefit of the doubt, we took a closer look. As it turns out, this claim is flawed as well. Since 2007, the federal government has adjusted the base beneficiary premium based on how many participants enroll in each plan. This means that a plan with a $20 premium that has 1,000 members would have much more influence on the average than, say, a $200 plan with one member. In 2006, the program was brand-new. That year’s figure could not be weighted by enrollment. The MedPac report given to us by Isakson’s office as well as a report from the Congressional Research Service confirmed that these plans were, for the most part, weighted equally. This pushed the 2006 figure artificially high, noted Jack Hoadley, a Georgetown University health policy analyst whose research on Medicare Part D is widely used by economists. Since few people picked the higher-price plans, the base beneficiary premium dropped in 2007. Now, as you’ll recall, the base beneficiary premium does not represent how much money seniors actually pay each month. Hoadley and a team from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation calculated this amount and found that premiums rose each year. In 2006, it was $25.93. In 2010, the latest year for which data is available, it was $36.90. That’s an increase of 42 percent. Why did prices creep upward? Hoadley, MedPac and others cite a couple of reasons. Seniors typically stay in their plans, even if they become more expensive. Switching is complicated and the plans are hard to understand, so there’s not as much pressure on health insurers to keep prices down. Also, some of the more popular plans have seen the largest jumps in premiums. However, CMS actually expects base beneficiary premiums to drop in 2012. That’s in part because extremely popular drugs will be available as less-expensive generics. Some have also suggested this is because of competition. This means that no matter how you cut it, Isakson’s claim that Medicare Part D’s premium "has gone down almost every year since it was put in place" is incorrect. The average cost of premiums that seniors actually pay has risen, as has the base beneficiary premium that Isakson’s staff provided. Furthermore, using the 2006 base beneficiary premium to assess other years’ figures amounts to comparing apples to oranges. That year, it was not possible to adjust the figure to account for which plans seniors actually chose. We presented our evidence to Isakson’s spokeswoman, who reiterated that he based his statement on federal government sources. That might be true, but the senator’s take on the numbers is not.

pomt-02365	Georgia has saved $20 million through changes in criminal sentencing.	true	/georgia/statements/2014/mar/19/nathan-deal/georgia-sentencing-reforms-pays-budget-deal-says/	The Great Recession forced many elected officials to rethink their approach to governing in some areas. In Georgia, it has resulted in a philosophical change that has saved the state millions of dollars, Gov. Nathan Deal recently told one group. Deal said the changes in criminal sentencing adopted in 2012 have helped Georgia’s bottom line by about $20 million. A PolitiFact Georgia reader saw an article that outlined the claim and asked us to check it out. We wanted to know whether the governor’s numbers were on target. Or should he be sentenced for faulty math? The governor made the comments at a reception of graduates of the University of Georgia School of Public Affairs in Atlanta. Deal told the group he was surprised by the speed and size of the savings, Morris News Service reported. "I was amazed at the dollar figures ... and amazed at the time frame," said Deal, a Republican. Deal spokesman Brian Robinson said that in 2011 the state paid counties more than $23 million to house state inmates in county jails, some of which were overcrowded. "In 2013, the payments were slightly under $3.2 million — approximately $20 million less!" Robinson wrote in one email. In 2012, Deal, a former prosecutor, said Georgia needed more cost-effective criminal justice approaches that didn't compromise public safety. State lawmakers crafted legislation to establish alternatives to incarceration for low-level, nonviolent drug and property offenders. At the time, 60 percent of Georgia’s inmates were locked up for drug and property crimes, according to a state study. Many elected officials across the country have employed a similar approach to balance their budgets in the post-recession world. In Georgia, the changes included reduced sentences for relatively minor crimes such as writing bad checks and burglary, and the state is diverting addicts to community supervision and treatment through so-called accountability courts instead of sending them through the normal criminal system and on to prison. State officials projected the package would save taxpayers $264 million in prison spending over the next five years. The big change has been the state is spending less money on housing inmates in county jails because of a lack of space in Georgia prisons. Those inmates assigned to the county lockups typically work on roadway or construction projects for that county. Georgia spends $20-$22 per day for each inmate in a county jail, records show. Deal’s proposed budget offers statistics that support his claim. In Fiscal Year 2012 -- which began July 1, 2011, and ended June 30, 2012 -- the state’s subsidy to various counties to house its inmates was slightly more than $25 million. In Deal’s proposed budget, Georgia’s Department of Corrections projected it would pay about $4.6 million to counties. Deal recommended about $1.6 million. Georgia’s Department of Corrections sent us several spreadsheets that also backed up the governor’s claim. In 2011, Deal’s first year in office, Georgia spent about $26.5 million to house state inmates in county jails. In 2013, the state paid counties nearly $3.8 million. That’s a $22.7 million difference. Statistics show there are fewer Georgia prisoners in state and county lockups. In March 2011, the average daily population in county jails awaiting a trip to state prison was nearly 5,000, Corrections Department figures show. Last week, there were just 611 inmates waiting to be transferred, the Corrections Department spreadsheets show. The average number of inmates sitting in state prison decreased by about 1,000 a day between 2011 and 2013. Another state report showed the year-round number of inmates had declined in the past two years from 40,648 to 35,111. To sum up, Deal said Georgia has saved $20 million through changes in sentencing. State data show there has been a $20 million decrease in the amount of money spent housing state inmates in county jails. We rate the governor's statement True.

pomt-02876	"The national debt is on track to double during Obama’s presidency."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/nov/13/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-debt-projected-double-under-obam/	Possible presidential aspirant Scott Walker opens his new book with a dismal depiction of conditions in the nation’s capital. "If you are like me, the view from Washington, D.C., these days is pretty grim," the Republican governor writes in "Unintimidated: A Governor's Story and a Nation's Challenge," which is due out Nov. 19, 2013. "Barack Obama has been elected to a second term. Obamacare will not be repealed anytime soon. Congress has approved massive tax increases." Then Walker makes this claim: "The national debt is on track to double during Obama’s presidency." Let’s see how much the debt has grown and to what extent Obama is responsible. What is the debt? We hear plenty about the federal debt and annual federal budget deficits. So, let’s make sure we’re on the same page before we dig in. Total federal debt, also known as gross debt, is the amount of debt issued by the U.S. Treasury and other federal agencies. It has two components: Debt held by the government is money the government owes itself. Mainly, the government borrows from trust funds such as Social Security and Medicare -- payments owed to beneficiaries in the future -- to fund current government operations. Debt held by the public is owed to investors outside the federal government, including individual and corporate investors in the United States and overseas, foreign governments, the Federal Reserve and other entities. It's money the government borrows when it runs annual budget deficits -- in other words, the money the government needs to bridge the gap between what it spends and what it takes in. How much is the debt? Jacquelynn Burke, a publicist for Sentinel, Walker’s publisher, responded to our request to Walker for information to back his claim. She told us Walker was referring to total debt and to the portion held by the public and cited two documents from Obama’s own administration, a 2013 report from the Council of Economic Advisers and Obama’s 2014 budget. It’s helpful here to note that debt is tallied at the end of the fiscal year and that the federal fiscal year runs from October through September. So, fiscal 2008 started in October 2007 and ended in September 2008. The documents Walker relies on show total debt on pace to double -- from $9.99 trillion in fiscal 2008 to an estimated $20 trillion in fiscal 2016; and debt held by the public to more than double, from $5.8 trillion to $14.7 trillion. (FactCheck.org also reports that debt held by the public is on pace to double during Obama’s presidency.) Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, cited the same documents Walker did when we asked him about Walker’s claim. Edwards said that, even though fiscal 2008 ended more than three months before Obama was first inaugurated, it is a good starting point because most of the debt accumulated in fiscal 2009 was from Obama’s stimulus plan. Joshua Gordon, policy director at the centrist Concord Coalition, which advocates for fiscal responsibility, argued that a better starting point is the end of fiscal 2009 -- a year later than what Walker uses -- since Obama would have been in office for nearly nine months at that point. He also argued against examining total debt, saying that since it includes borrowing from Social Security, it "doesn't really have any economic significance." Gordon cited figures from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office for debt held by the public. They show that that portion of the total debt was $7.54 trillion at the end of fiscal 2009, but isn’t projected to double until fiscal 2019, after Obama leaves office. Gordon and Marc Goldwein, senior policy director of the nonprofit Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan organization focused on debt reduction, also made another point on comparing debt levels over time. They told us measuring debt as a percentage of gross domestic product is better for comparison purposes than simply using raw dollars. According to Congressional Budget Office figures, debt held by the public as a percentage of gross domestic product won’t double during Obama’s presidency. They show debt held by the public at the end of 2009 was equal to 52.3% of gross domestic product. That’s expected to reach 76.2% at the end of fiscal 2014, but then drop during the rest of Obama’s presidency. At the same time, the federal debt is commonly reported in raw dollars, not as a percentage of GDP. So, at least in terms of raw dollars, there is evidence that debt is projected to double during Obama’s time in office. Who's to blame Walker implied that Obama plays a role in how much the debt has grown, but he didn’t say the president caused the increase. That squares with how we’ve evaluated similar claims in the past. For one thing, each president inherits the previous president’s budget, as well as the interest payments needed to pay off debts accumulated under previous presidents. Moreover, about two-thirds of the annual deficit during Obama’s presidency term has been from entitlements and interest. Entitlements, such as Social Security and Medicare, are less susceptible to a president’s policy preferences than discretionary spending that Congress must approve on an annual basis. Entitlements are also more heavily driven by demographic factors, such as the aging of the population, which is also out of any president’s control. For its part, The White House didn't challenge Walker's claim, but cited documents indicating that annual deficits are becoming smaller. A couple of other points on responsibility for the debt before we close. An analysis by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities acknowledged that deficits and debt "have been sharply higher under Obama." But the analysis says the Great Recession, tax cuts adopted under President George W. Bush, and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq "explain most of the deficits that have occurred on Obama’s watch." The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, meanwhile, traces the the debt problem back even further, to around 1970, "when the government decided to significantly increase spending without a corresponding increase in revenue." The problem can’t be fixed, according to that analysis, "without creating a mechanism to prevent the government from running persistent deficits in the future." Our rating Walker said: "The national debt is on track to double during Obama’s presidency." Documents from Obama’s own administration indicate the debt is on pace to double in raw dollars, the way the debt is commonly reported, though not as a percentage of gross domestic product. Walker aptly indicated that Obama bears part of the blame. We rate Walker’s statement Mostly True. To comment on this item, please go to JSOnline.com.

pomt-08680	"Sean Duffy backed plan to privatize Social Security."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/10/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee-says-s/	Using Social Security as a focus of a political attack -- especially labeling an opponent as out to gut the popular program -- is a tactic almost as old as the program itself. In the race to succeed retiring U.S. Rep. Dave Obey (D-Wausau) in Wisconsin’s 7th District, the attack came early. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the group in charge of retaining control of the House for Democrats, launched an ad against Republican Sean Duffy claiming Duffy supports privatizing Social Security. The issue could be a potent one in the northwest Wisconsin district, open for the first time since 1969. Indeed, 15.7 percent of the district residents are 65 years or older -- the highest rate of the state’s eight congressional districts and above the 13.2 percent figure statewide. With its ad, the DCCC piggybacks on an earlier web ad from the state Democratic Party and on claims being made by state Sen. Julie Lassa (D-Stevens Point), who is running unopposed for her party’s nomination. They all make essentially the same claim against Duffy -- and even cite each other when providing support for their statements. We’ll focus on the DCCC ad, which includes the requisite ominous tone and imagery. "When we should be fighting to protect Social Security, Sean Duffy backed a plan to privatize it," the ad states, later referring to the stock market and adding: "Remember the crash? Families could have lost 40% of their retirement benefits." Scary stuff. So, does Duffy really want to play the stock market with Social Security funds? In supporting its claim, the DCCC points to Duffy’s support of the fiscal plan crafted by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Janesville) called "A Roadmap for America’s Future." Ryan, the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee, introduced the wide-ranging plan in 2008 and in January 2010 began shopping around an updated version for sponsors. The proposal has attracted considerable attention nationally, though not everyone who supports its concept has signed on to each individual piece. And it has not been identified by House leaders as a priority. When it comes to Duffy, the DCCC refers to the state Democratic Party’s web ad, which includes a video snippet dated March 11, 2010, in which Duffy tells an unidentified questioner he supports the Ryan Roadmap. Question: "Do you support it?" Duffy: "I do." The first question is whether the Ryan plan would privatize Social Security. The plan calls for the creation of optional "personal" accounts that would be owned by the individual and "managed and overseen by Social Security -- not a stockbroker or private investment firm." The accounts have a guarantee that they would never lose money. They would be voluntary -- not mandatory -- and available to those now under age 55. Ryan says his plan "provides future retirees with the option to either stay in the traditional government-run system or to enter a system of guaranteed personal accounts. Neither option is privatized." The money would be invested mutual funds or bonds. Yes, they’re tied to Wall Street, but are overseen by the government. Ryan said the same system is used for state and federal employees, including members of Congress. The claims regarding whether the Ryan plan privatizes Social Security have been looked at repeatedly and debunked. The national PolitiFact site even turned to a linguist who noted that an earlier Republican plan calling for "private" accounts was tweaked after pollsters found the public was more comfortable with the term "personal" accounts. "Privatization is usually taking government programs and handing them over to industry to run," Geoffrey Nunberg, a linguist at the University of California at Berkeley, told PolitiFact National. " ‘Privatize Social Security' makes it sound like they want to hand it over to Visa to run." Nevertheless, the semantics of the matter are central to the debate. For some, personal investment accounts -- even if they are overseen and managed by the government -- are private, especially when compared with the current system. For others, the accounts are "privatized" when they are managed by a Wall Street firm. That sounds like the definition Democrats are using. After all, the ad and related statements refer to the plunges in the stock market, and greedy Wall Street bankers. The ad against Duffy follows a similar pattern being used nationally, in which Democrats are attempting to tie general statements of support for Ryan’s plan to specific pieces that may be unpalatable to voters. It’s sort of how a vote for a massive spending bill is picked apart and used to hang individual items on those who supported the overall measure. As Duffy’s two-word answer cited in the web ad indicates, he has voiced some support for Ryan’s Roadmap. But what has he said about privatizing Social Security? In a Wausau Daily Herald item about an Aug. 23 editorial board meeting, Duffy is quoted as saying: "Privatizing is not an option." On his campaign website, Duffy states: "I have not and will not endorse privatizing Social Security because I don’t believe it is the solution to making Social Security solvent." And this is what Duffy told the Journal Sentinel about his views: "Do I want to see people take their Social Security payments and put them into private accounts, open up an eTrade account and go into the stock market? Absolutely not." Duffy said he is willing to "look at all kinds of different systems" but says he has not come out with his own proposal or endorsed Ryan’s plan. "I’ve said it’s a good starting point," Duffy said. So, the DCCC ad uses a Duffy statement -- cut and spliced by the state Democrats for maximum effect -- to brand Duffy as an advocate for privatizing Social Security. But Duffy is on the record repeatedly as opposing privatizing Social Security and says he is not supportive of Ryan’s entire "roadmap" plan. What’s more, Democrats say Duffy would leave recipients at the mercy of Wall Street, when the plan would restrict investments to government managed accounts and guarantee them against long-term losses. The Democrats’ claim is not just false, it’s ridiculously so. Where’s a match? We rate it Pants on Fire.

pomt-10877	"He's leading by example, refusing contributions from PACs and Washington lobbyists."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/aug/21/barack-obama/if-it-quacks-like-a-lobbyist-its-a-lobbyist/	In his speeches and his TV ads, Barack Obama criticizes the influence of lobbyists. "I know that I haven't spent a lot of time learning the ways of Washington," he says in the television spot. "But I've been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington must change." The announcer says, "He's leading by example, refusing contributions from PACs and Washington lobbyists who have too much power today." But his anti-lobbyist policy includes one caveat and a few loopholes that weaken his claim to be funding his political campaign in a way that's truly different from his competitors. He almost always qualifies his statement to note that he won't take money from federal lobbyists, a distinction that allows him to accept money from well-connected state lobbyists. For example, South Florida lobbyist Russ Klenet and his wife will host a fundraising event in Broward County for Obama on August 25. Klenet represents state groups such as the Florida Association of Mortgage Brokers, but also companies such as Match.com and Election Systems & Software. And Obama still accepts tens of thousands of dollars from people who work for Washington firms that do substantial lobbying. Former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle is an Obama contributor who isn't a registered lobbyist, but works as a consultant for Alston & Bird, a lobbying firm in Washington. The Center for Responsive Politics found that Obama accepted $55,019 from employees at lobbying firms, and much more from companies that are not classified as lobbying firms but have lobbying divisions. So we give Obama's statement a Half-True on the Truth-O-Meter. While Obama can accurately say that he does not accept money from federally registered lobbyists, he still accepts thousands from people in the influence industry.

pomt-00563	Thanks to the Act 10 collective bargaining law that took effect four years ago, ACT scores in Wisconsin "are now second-best in the country for states where more than half the kids take the exam."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jun/12/scott-walker/citing-collective-bargaining-law-scott-walker-says/	Gov. Scott Walker is a contender for president largely because of the collective bargaining reforms -- affecting teachers and most other public employees -- that he signed into law following massive protests in Madison. On June 2, 2015, at a Florida gathering of announced and likely Republican candidates for the White House, Walker credited the March 2011 law for what he said was Wisconsin's improved ranking on the ACT college preparation test. "A lot of protesters at the time claimed that public education was going to fail," Walker said, then went on to list changes made by what is known as Act 10. "I’m proud to tell you that today, we no longer have seniority or tenure. That means we can hire and fire based on merit, we can pay based on performance. That means we can put the best and the brightest in our classrooms and we can pay them to be there. "I said the proof is in the pudding; the facts don’t lie. Four years later, graduation rates are up, third-grade reading scores are up, ACT scores are now second-best in the country for states where more than half the kids take the exam." Saying Wisconsin's ACT scores are now second-best suggests Wisconsin's ranking on the test has improved since Act 10 and that the law played a role. Let's see. Where we've been Two previous fact checks help set the table for evaluating Walker's claim. 1. In February 2011, with the protests being carried out daily, the Wisconsin Democratic Party claimed that the five states that outlaw collective bargaining for teachers all ranked below 44th in the nation in test scores, while Wisconsin ranked second. PolitiFact National rated the claim False, partly because the data cited for both major college preparation tests -- the ACT and the SAT -- was a decade old. More importantly, in terms of evaluating Walker's claim, our colleagues concluded after talking with experts that "it’s impossible to know whether collective bargaining has any role in causing test scores to rise. That’s because countless other demographic, economic and cultural factors play a role in shaping a state’s test scores." 2. In June 2014, we rated Mostly True a Walker claim that graduation rates and third-grade reading scores in Wisconsin were higher than when he took office in January 2011. Both numbers were up compared with the year before Walker took office. But we found that some credit may be owed to prior elected officials, because the trend lines hadn’t really changed much going back deeper into the pre-Walker era. We also noted in that item that Wisconsin students’ longstanding high-achievement scores on the ACT are well known. But let's flesh them out. Here are Wisconsin’s average composite scores on the ACT, and where Wisconsin ranked among the states where more than half the students take the exam. Those are the ones Walker specifically cited in making the claim. We took a look at the three years before and the three years after 2011, when Act 10 was adopted. Year Score Rank 2008 22.3 3rd -- behind Minnesota and Iowa 2009 22.3 3rd -- behind Minnesota and Iowa 2010 22.2 3rd -- tied with Nebraska -- behind Minnesota and Iowa 2011 (Act 10 OK’d in March) 22.2 3rd -- behind Minnesota and Iowa 2012 22.1 2nd -- tied with Iowa -- behind Minnesota 2013 22.1 2nd -- tied with Iowa -- behind Minnesota 2014 22.2 2nd -- behind Minnesota So, Wisconsin's rank moved from third to second in 2012, the year after Act 10 was adopted, and has remained there. But that's not because Wisconsin's long-stable composite score has improved. Indeed, the score is virtually unchanged since Act 10. Moreover, as we noted previously, there is no evidence to show how any one factor affects ACT scores -- particularly an indirect factor such as a personnel policy like Act 10. Matthew Di Carlo, senior research fellow at the Albert Shanker Institute, which studies education policy, reiterated that it would be "enormously complicated" to determine how any one factor such as socioeconomic status affects ACT scores. That's all the more true for changes in collective bargaining -- a policy that affects personnel rather than one, such as tutoring, that directly affects student learning, he said. And while Act 10 could have some indirect effects on ACT scores -- such as through the retention of teachers -- those effects couldn't be gauged for some period of years, Di Carlo said. Our rating Walker said that four years after his collective bargaining law took effect, ACT scores in Wisconsin "are now second-best in the country for states where more than half the kids take the exam." There is an element of truth in Walker’s statement, in that Wisconsin's rank moved from third to second in 2012, the year after the Act 10 collective bargaining reforms were adopted. But the rank didn’t improve because of an improvement in Wisconsin’s score. And there is no evidence that Act 10 affected the ranking. For a statement that has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-05216	Says Barack Obama has played nearly 100 rounds of golf as president.	true	/texas/statements/2012/jun/08/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-obama-has-played-nearly-100-rounds/	Texas Gov. Rick Perry warmed up delegates to the Republican Party of Texas convention in Fort Worth on June 7, 2012, by mentioning the Democratic president he once hoped to succeed. Saying the country needs a president "who believes in us again," Perry continued, according to his prepared remarks: "Three and a half years, and nearly 100 rounds of golf into his presidency, Barack Obama has exploded the federal debt, passed a failed, budget-busting stimulus package, socialized health care, and provided guns to Mexican drug cartels." That’s a handful of provocative claims -- including the familiar one we are tackling here about Obama and "fore!" Has Obama played nearly 100 rounds of golf? We know already, due to our April 2012 confirmation of a David Dewhurst claim, that Obama had played over 90 rounds of golf through May 2, 2012. That article pointed out, too, that many presidents have gone golfing. Our sources for the Obama count included CBS newsman Mark Knoller, who has long tracked each president’s outings, and another White House correspondent, Keith Koffler, who has taken to blogging about times that Obama goes golfing. Koffler said in a Dec. 26, 2011, blog post: "After an hour of hiking, President Obama Monday got down to the serious business at hand, heading out to golf for the second day in his first three days of vacation. He was back on the course at Marine Corps Base Hawaii. With this one, Obama reaches a new milestone, having gone golfing 90 times in less than three years as president." So, is Obama approaching 100 rounds of golf? Looks like it. Koffler posted a blog on May 26, 2012 stating that Obama was going golfing that day for his 98th time as president. On June 8, 2012, Koffler replied to our inquiry by saying that Obama has yet to play round 99. We rate Perry’s claim as True.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2012-06-08T12:10:42	2012-06-07	['None']

pomt-00412	"California lawmakers are planning to push free abortion pills on all students across the state as part of a ‘super progressive’ new policy."	mostly false	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/aug/30/yournewswirecom/free-abortion-pills-will-not-be-pushed-california-/	A stock photo of a smiling soccer team of young girls accompanies an article from YourNewsWire.com claiming that free abortion pills would be pushed on "all students" in California under a proposed law. Not quite. If SB 320 passes the state Assembly, it will mandate access to medication abortion on the 34 public campuses in the University of California and California State University systems. The legislation refers to medication abortions, where pills are prescribed to end pregnancy in the first 10 weeks. The medications involved, mifepristone and misoprostol, are sometimes referred to as abortion pills. But those medication abortions won’t be free, and they won’t be available to "all students across the state." The bill involves public state universities and their student health centers — not high schools or private schools. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The majority of the Your News Wire article was lifted from an opinion piece written by Lila Rose, the founder and president of the anti-abortion group Live Action, known for creating "sting" videos targeting Planned Parenthood. This original column ran on WashingtonExaminer.com, a conservative-leaning publication. Your News Wire changed the column’s headline from "California moving to mandate abortion pills on campus" to the more inclusive and incorrect "California to supply free abortion pills to all students." We contacted the article's author, Sean Adl-Tabatabai, and the article was deleted from the site within minutes. "Since being alerted to this we have decided to completely remove the article from our website as we cannot substantiate the claims made," Adl-Tabatabai said in an email. Here's where their original reporting went wrong. What the bill says The bill passed the state Senate in January. It hasn’t passed the Assembly, as of Aug. 29. If SB 320 becomes law, California would be the first state to mandate that medication abortions be available as part of basic university student health services. Only two universities surveyed in the 2015 American College Health Association PAP & STI Survey provided medication abortions at their health centers. The University of Illinois at Chicago is one example. Its student health center started providing medication abortions in 2006. Medication abortions cost about $600 out-of-pocket, according to an August study about the California measure that was published in the Journal of Adolescent Health. If provided on-campus, they would not be free, but the cost might be reduced. "While it is not yet known how much students would pay for an on-campus medication abortion, the costs are likely to be the same or lower than those going to an off-campus clinic," the study stated. Those costs would be handled the same as other student health services, according to Sergio Reyes, communications director for state Sen. Connie Leyva, who introduced the bill. "Medication abortion services at student health centers could be paid for the way any other basic health care on campus is covered," Reyes said. "Some options that are available to student health centers are for them to bill Medi-Cal, charge a fee for service, cover it through student fees or by contracting with a community provider who comes to campus and handles the billing." Initial costs for preparing student health centers to administer medication abortions would be privately funded, according to the text of the bill. From those private funds, grants of up to $200,000 would be administered to student health centers to pay for the equipment and training needed to be able to perform medication abortions by 2022. Separate $200,000 grants would fund telehealth services, services to bill insurance and Medi-Cal and a 24-hour hotline for people who have had a medication abortion at a student health center. "SB 320 aims to have private grants pay for the cost to get each student health center ready to provide this service, but is not prescriptive in how each student health center decides to fund it on an ongoing basis," Reyes said. He added that student health centers are already responsible for covering all operating costs of th health centers, and that the only additional cost would be the medication, at approximately $60 to$70 dollars per pill. Reyes said that a person seeking a medication abortion must first meet with a health care provider, who determines the age of the pregnancy. Our ruling The Your News Wire headline said, "California lawmakers are planning to push free abortion pills on all students across the state as part of a ‘super progressive’ new policy."

pomt-02515	Responding to a major snow event in Atlanta would be like Kansas City, Mo., responding to a major earthquake.	false	/georgia/statements/2014/feb/12/sly-james/snow-response-comparison-faulty/	Kansas City, Mo., Mayor Sly James came to the defense of Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed for what Reed acknowledges was a poorly timed response to Atlanta’s recent snowjam. "That mayor down there’s getting blame for a lot of stuff he’s got nothing to do with, and I understand that," James told the morning rush-hour audience on AM 750 and 95.5 FM WSB. "So I’m always going to defend mayors, especially when I know how good they are." "A major snow event in Atlanta, for them to respond to that, is kind of equivalent to us responding to a major earthquake," James said. "It just doesn’t happen that often." As Atlanta hunkers down for its second snow of the year, we wondered about James’ comparison for a couple of reasons. First of all, roads covered in snow and ice can certainly be hairy and dangerous. But could they be worse than the ground shaking and potentially opening up from an earthquake? Secondly, just how often does Kansas City have a major earthquake? And how’s that compare with the frequency of crippling snowstorms in Atlanta? We decided James’ statement merited further scrutiny. We contacted Dan Deocampo, an associate professor and chairman of the department of geosciences at Georgia State University. "Actually, major snow events in Atlanta occur more frequently than major earthquakes in Kansas City," he said. The last major earthquake affecting Kansas City was about 200 years ago in the New Madrid Fault Zone, although there was a magnitude 5.6 quake that shook the city in 2011, Deocampo said. "The likelihood of strong shaking in the Kansas City area is pretty low compared to San Francisco or Los Angeles," said Robert A. Williams, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Colorado. "But it's not zero likelihood." By contrast, the city of Atlanta has had 11 snowstorms of 4 inches or more over the past 80 years. The biggest was on Jan. 23, 1940, when 8.3 inches of the white stuff blanketed Atlanta, according to the National Weather Service at Peachtree City. In March 2009, 4.2 inches of snow fell, forcing some school districts to close for a day, Delta Air Lines to cancel about 300 round-trip flights and about 12,000 metro Atlantans to lose electricity. The city’s biggest snowfall since then took place in January 2011, when 3.7 inches were recorded at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, according to the weather service. On Jan. 28, the date of Atlanta’s most recent snow, 2.6 inches fell at the airport, and hundreds of motorists and schoolchildren were stranded for hours, some even overnight, in cars and schools. For longtime Atlantans, that conjured up memories of "Snowjam" 1982, when 7 inches fell on the city over three days and streets and interstates were immobilized. Bill Murphey, the state climatologist and chief meteorologist for the Georgia Environmental Protection Division, said the snowstorms on Super Bowl Sunday 2000 and in January 1973 were arguably among the more notable. The snap, crackle, pop of electrical transformers due to ice in 1973 "really paralyzed the city," he said. The January 2000 event also created widespread power outages, Murphey said. As far as average snowfall amounts go, Atlanta sees about 2.1 inches a year. That is based, Murphey said, on 69 years of data up to 2009 from the Southeast Regional Climate Center. We contacted the mayor’s office, where spokesman Carlos Campos was unaware of James’ remarks. He said the mayor has said repeatedly that the city failed to help coordinate closing times in an orderly manner with schools, businesses and government agencies. "He is pleased, otherwise, with the response as it concerns restoration of roads to normal within a little more than 24 hours," Campos said. James said responding to a major snow event in Atlanta would be like Kansas City responding to a major earthquake. He was coming to the defense of another mayor, Atlanta’s Kasim Reed, whom he saw as unfairly castigated for events beyond the mayor’s control. That’s fair. But to compare cleaning up the mess from 2 inches of snow to recovering from a major earthquake rattles the very heart of the Truth-O-Meter. One is relatively common over the span of decades. The other, extremely rare. The Kansas City mayor overreached on this one. We rate James’ statement False.

pomt-05932	"Congressman Phil Roe hands out $1.3M government check" from a federal program that "he voted against."	mostly true	/tennessee/statements/2012/jan/29/tennessee-democratic-party/democrats-claim-gop-congressman-roe-voted-against-/	Politicians like to hand out government checks, especially when the money is for a worthy project in their district or rewards a business or company for a job well done. But the Tennessee Democratic Party accused U.S. Rep. Phil Roe, R-Johnson City, of hypocrisy after he showed up at Takoma Regional Hospital in Greeneville on Jan. 5 to present a $1.3 million check from the federal government. Roe, by the way, is a physician, and his website prominently places "M.D." after his name at every opportunity and mentions he has delivered "close to 5,000 babies." But Democrats are calling him a hypocrite: "Congressman Phil Roe Hands Out $1.3M Government Check – He Voted Against," the party proclaimed in a press release. The release included a photo of a smiling Roe and hospital officials holding a poster-sized copy of a check, with the caption underneath reading: "GOP Congressman Roe: Do as I say, not as I do." Roe is hardly the first congressman to stand accused of saying one thing and doing another. But we wondered if the charges were true: Did he really deliver a check that he voted against? The $1.3 million that Takoma Regional received was for partial reimbursement of the health-care facility’s investment in an electronic health record system that the hospital says speeds up care and gives patients electronic access to their records. The money comes from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the economic stimulus package that Congress passed shortly after President Barack Obama took office. The legislation directed billions of dollars to encourage health-care facilities to adopt electronic record-keeping. Facilities and physicians who meet certain health and efficiency goals through their use of electronic records are eligible for reimbursement payments from the Medicare and Medicaid systems. Takoma Regional spent about $5 million converting to an electronic records system that meets the requirements set out by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The $1.3 million from the federal government was for partial reimbursement of that investment. Roe did vote against the economic stimulus package when it received final approval in the House by a vote of 246-183 on Feb. 13, 2009. In a press release at the time, Roe called the bill "the single largest infusion of spending in American history" and complained it had been rushed through Congress. He also argued it did not include enough funding for infrastructure projects. "I strongly support a stimulus initiative for our nation, but it must be a stimulus bill that grows our economy, creates jobs and doesn’t saddle our grandchildren with unnecessary debt," he said. But while Roe voted against the stimulus funding, he did not technically vote against the check for Takoma Regional. Congress does not vote on each reimbursement check – the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services automatically distributes the money to health-care facilities and physicians that meet the criteria. It may be a case of splitting hairs, but while Roe voted against the stimulus bill that provided the funding to reimburse Takoma Regional, he did not actually vote against the program that funded the grant to Takoma Regional – because there was no vote. One more thing to consider: There was no actual, physical check, said Lyndon Gallimore, Takoma Regional’s director for marketing and business development. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services put the money into the hospital’s banking account back in November via direct deposit. The hospital made up a poster-sized copy of a fake check and invited Roe to present it at the ceremony, Gallimore said. "We called and invited him because we felt like this was a significant first in our area," Gallimore said. "He’s the closest representative that we have in the federal government, and that’s why we called him." Roe sees nothing wrong with Takoma Regional getting its share of the stimulus funding, even though he opposed the bill. "You can’t spend over $816 billion and not do some good things," the congressman said in a statement. "But the real question is, was the stimulus legislation a waste of taxpayer dollars?" Our ruling Congressman Roe voted against the stimulus bill that provided the reimbursement funding for Takoma Regional and later showed up at a ceremony in which the hospital announced it had received the funding. But because Roe did not vote against this particular hospital receiving that specific $1.3 million federal reimbursement for converting to electronic medical records, we’re going with Mostly True on the Tennessee Democratic Party’s claim.

pomt-09620	Says she has "quadrupled agents to secure our border."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/jan/12/kay-bailey-hutchison/hutchison-says-she-quadrupled-border-patrol-agents/	A TV ad for U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison describes her as a conservative as tough as Texas, who "doesn't just talk tough, but delivers." The ad cites her work against a state income tax, opposing the economic stimulus package and says she has "quadrupled agents to secure our border," among other claims. Although she is correct that the number of agents has quadrupled since she became a senator in 1993 — from 3,600 to more than 18,000 now — much of the increase was prompted by requests from President George W. Bush, who honored his 2004 promise to double Border Patrol agents from 9,000. And Hutchison is only one of 100 senators. We wondered how much credit she can accurately take for all that growth in Border Patrol manpower. Hutchinson's TV ad flashes tiny print from a 2006 San Antonio Express-News editorial endorsing the incumbent senator for another term: "Her influence has been instrumental in securing funding for 1,500 new Border Patrol agents." But that refers to a 2005 boost in funding, not the cumulative increase that took place over time. It's true that Hutchison has pushed for funding and consistently voted to increase Border Patrol since her first year on the Hill, notably joining Congress to pass an immigration bill in 1996 that authorized the addition of 5,000 agents over five years. She's been active on the issue, even if some of her bills didn't pass. In 1995, she introduced the Immigration Reform Control Act that would have added 6,000 patrol agents, but it never made it out of the Judiciary Committee. Nor did the Border Law Enforcement Relief Act of 2008 that she co-sponsored to increase funding for agencies addressing border-related crime. In 2001, she voted for a bill that snagged $180 million for law enforcement on the U.S.- Mexico border, fulfilling Hutchison's requests to hire 570 full-time Border Patrol agents and fund new facilities across Texas for fiscal year 2002. But anyone who votes for an immigration bill — and almost all of the measures include a Border Patrol component — can claim credit for bolstering the patrol force, says Dr. Nestor Rodriguez, a sociology professor at the University of Texas. (The bill Hutchison voted on in 2001 passed 98-1.) We spoke with several experts about which senators have championed legislation to beef up the Border Patrol, and nobody volunteered Hutchison's name. The experts noted that the measures were widely supported on both sides of the aisle — not proving controversial. "The general consensus on Capitol Hill is that we were, and are, understaffed," said T.J. Donner, president of the National Border Patrol Council, a labor union that represents more than 17,000 border agents and staff. Donner said Bush deserves the credit for stregthening the border patrol. Hutchison has advocated increasing border agents, but she didn't personally quadruple anything. In many cases, the increases were pushed by President Bush and she was one of many who supported them. We find her claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-13718	Says Donald Trump "games the U.S. visa system so he can hire temporary foreign workers at low wages."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/jul/27/michael-bloomberg/michael-bloomberg-donald-trump-visa-sys/	Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg portrayed Donald Trump as a hypocrite on immigration in a speech at the Democratic National Convention. While Trump wants to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, he also uses the system to his advantage to hire foreigners, Bloomberg said in his endorsement of Hillary Clinton July 27, 2016. Trump "games the U.S. visa system so he can hire temporary foreign workers at low wages," Bloomberg said. While the accusation that Trump "games the system" is tough language, the real estate tycoon has hired temporary foreign workers to fill typically low-wage jobs at his properties. We will explain how he did it. H-2B visas We couldn’t reach a spokesman for Bloomberg, however, it’s likely he was referring to Trump hiring foreign workers at his Mar-A-Lago Club, an exclusive eating club in a mansion in Palm Beach County, Florida. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz made a similar attack during the primary. The club has sought H-2B visas for low-skilled, low-wage workers such as cooks, wait staff and housekeepers. H-2B visas are legal — Congress has set the cap at 66,000 per year — and its agricultural counterpart is the H-2A visa. The vast majority of the workers on these two visas programs nationwide are young Mexican men, although news reports say Trump sought workers from Europe. Employers argue they need these temporary workers to fill jobs Americans don’t want, while critics say the workers can be exploited. Since the visas are tied to a particular job, the foreigners can’t simply jump ship for a better paying job at another resort. The worker is paid based on the prevailing wage or minimum wage. Since 2010, nearly 300 U.S. residents applied or were referred for jobs at Mar-A-Lago, but only 17 were hired, the New York Times reported in February. Meanwhile, Mar-A-Lago sought more than 500 visas for foreign workers. (The visas were also sought at some of his other properties.) We don’t know how many people actually used the visas and became employees. To obtain the visas, businesses must prove they were unsuccessful at filling positions with Americans or legal residents. According to the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, the resort posted jobs through CareerSource Florida, the local workforce development boards throughout the state. A U.S. Labor Department spokesman told PolitiFact Florida previously that 93 people applied for 250 seasonal job openings at the resort. Four were hired, while 79 didn’t answer interview requests or turned down jobs (10 applications were classified with unknown status). Documents the resort later filed with the Labor Department showed that many of the American applicants weren’t hired because they didn’t meet requirements. Some applicants didn’t want to work split shifts, lacked experience, wanted full-time jobs instead of part time, or didn’t respond when the resort contacted them. After that process, the Labor Department certified 685 H-2B visas for the Mar-A-Lago Club between 2008 and 2015. The New York Times asked Trump why he hired so many foreign workers when Americans applied for the same positions. "The only reason they wouldn’t get a callback is that they weren’t qualified, for some reason," Trump replied. "There are very few qualified people during the high season in the area." But some experts question Trump’s assessment that it’s hard to find local help. In 2015, CareerSource assisted in placing nearly 1,800 candidates in hospitality jobs in Palm Beach County. But Mar-A-Lago didn’t show much interest in using the free service. Tom Veenstra, senior director of support services at CareerSource in Palm Beach County, told PolitiFact Florida that the first time his office received a request for helping finding workers was September 2015. (That was shortly after one of the first news reports, by Reuters, about Trump’s foreign hiring practices.) Since that time, Mar-A-Lago used the office to hire just one person, a banquet server. "We called the HR director after the hire, and she said they were pleased with the hire and the candidates we sent them," Veenstra said. "There has been nothing else since then." So is Trump gaming the system? Gabriel "Jack" Chin, a professor at University of California Davis School of Law, said many of these companies say they can’t find American workers but only put in minimal effort. "One answer is ‘yes, this is gaming the system, but everybody does it,’ in the sense that the labor certification standards are widely thought to be evaded in the way that Mar-A-Lago has done in the past," Chin said. Trump spokesman Stephen Miller referred us to Trump’s reply during the March 10 debate in Miami when he defended the use of these visas. "I'm a businessman," Trump said. "These are laws. These are regulations. These are rules. We're allowed to do it. And frankly, because of the devaluations that other countries -- the monetary devaluations that other countries are constantly doing and brilliantly doing against us, it's very, very hard for our companies in this country, in our country, to compete. So I will take advantage of it; they're the laws. But I'm the one that knows how to change it. Nobody else on this dais knows how to change it like I do, believe me." Miller said that Trump has opposed legislation to expand the visa program and pledged to reform visa programs to protect American workers. Our ruling Bloomberg says Trump "games the U.S. visa system so he can hire temporary foreign workers at low wages." Trump sought visas for hundreds of foreign workers to fill temporary positions at his Mar-A-Lago Club in Florida in recent years. Hundreds of U.S. applicants either applied or were referred for the jobs, but only a handful were hired. There is some debate about whether those applicants were qualified or not. Trump has used a legal program to obtain workers with H-2B visas. Saying he "games" the system is harsh language, and an expert says the process used by Trump is common. We rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/90e178aa-a06c-4fa1-913f-1777415af770	None	Michael Bloomberg	None	None	None	2016-07-27T21:51:54	2016-07-27	['United_States']
pomt-12629	"215 members of Congress just voted to let your ISP spy on what type of underwear you buy and sell that data to advertisers."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/30/fight-future/congress-let-internet-providers-spy-your-underwear/	Your Internet service provider has intimate knowledge about your intimates, and a bill headed to President Donald Trump’s desk allows them to sell that information, says Internet privacy advocacy group Fight for the Future. Voting along party lines, Republicans in Congress recently passed a joint resolution that reverses a landmark Federal Communications Commission rule requiring Internet service providers (ISPs), like Comcast or Verizon, to ask customers for their explicit permission before handing user data over to advertisers and other third parties. President Donald Trump is expected to sign it into law. "215 members of Congress just voted to let your ISP spy on what type of underwear you buy and sell that data to advertisers," Fight for the Future tweeted March 28, after the bill passed the House. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Fight for the Future has the vote count right; 215 members of the House of Representatives voted for the measure. We decided to dig into whether the group is right about what the bill means for online shopping. ISPs and the bill Fight for the Future’s tweet might give the misleading impression that ISPs can’t already see their customers’ online purchases and sell that information. They can. Congress’ action just makes this explicitly legal. An ISP’s function is to connect its users to websites or online apps, and so it can see nearly everything its users do on the Internet, including what kind of underwear they buy. An advertiser might be interested in purchasing that information from an ISP because then it can predict whether a given user is more likely to respond to an ad for boxers, briefs or tighty-whities. Beyond shopping habits, ISPs and advertisers can glean more significant personal information about their customers from Internet browsing patterns — like that a spouse is contemplating divorce because he looked up "best divorce lawyers in my area," or that a person has a chronic medical condition because she spent a long time reading certain pages on WebMD. In October 2016, the FCC established rules intended to give consumers more control over how ISPs used their data. The rules required ISPs to obtain explicit information from their customers before using and sharing their web browsing history, which would include underwear purchases. The rule also required the ISPs to get consent before sharing other "sensitive information," like Social Security numbers, precise geolocation data and financial or health information. Many Internet companies and trade associations had already committed to requiring consumers to opt-in before they can share that sort of information, per guidance from the Federal Trade Commission. But these opt-in rules never went into effect; Congress killed them in March 2017, months before the December 2017 start date. So ISPs can see and use customers’ web browsing data as they always have. "Practically speaking, I expect consumers will see no change in how their data is collected and marketed," said Brent Skorup, a technology policy research fellow at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center. Fight for the Future Campaign Director Evan Greer said Congress’ vote was significant because it gives ISP companies explicit permission to engage in practices that some privacy advocates consider "abusive," and it gives ISPs an incentive to invest in systems to further these practices. ISPs have been expanding the scope of their operations, merging with other varieties of service providers, such as Verizon purchasing AOL, or AT&T’s planned deal to purchase Time Warner, Inc. This, combined with Congress’ reversal of the FCC rules, might encourage ISPs to expand their role in online advertising, said Peter Swire, a professor at Georgia Tech and the chief counselor for privacy during President Bill Clinton’s administration. "There’s a lot of online advertising today," Swire said. "Now the big broadband companies will play more actively in that space." Those who supported gutting the FCC rules argue that the regulations put ISPs at a disadvantage compared to other Internet companies, like search engines or social media sites, that already sell users’ data without first getting permission. They also say the rules stifle technology innovation. Privacy advocates, however, say that ISPs have an especially large window into its users Internet habits, and this rule could have opened up the possibility of beginning to enact privacy regulations on other web-based companies. "This is troublesome because of the larger question: Is privacy opt in or opt out?" said Jamie Winterton, director of strategy for Arizona State University’s Global Security Initiative. "Can your browser behaviors be bought and sold?" Privacy protections Though they can see a lot, there are limitations to what ISPs can see. Some websites use encryption, so the ISP can see the domain name but not the exact page on that website the user is browsing. A website is encrypted if the address starts with "https" not "http." For example, if a web user visit the Macy’s website, which is encrypted, their ISP will know they’re browsing the Macy’s website, but it won’t know if they’re shopping for underwear, a prom dress or bedding. (The article you’re currently reading is not encrypted.) However, if someone visits MeUndies.com right after visiting VictoriasSecret.com — both encrypted — an advertiser can probably make an educated guess that the person is in the market for some underwear. There are many more sophisticated ways an ISP or third party can glean information about a user even when the data is encrypted. Regardless, most ecommerce sites remain unencrypted, Swire said. An Internet user who really does not want an ISP tracking any of their data can use a Virtual Private Network, which, put simply, is a way to scramble all Internet traffic so the ISP and potential hackers can’t get at it. But this might not completely eliminate privacy concerns because some VPNs themselves don’t fully protect users’ data. "If you don’t want any of your information out there, you’d have to do all sorts of things," Winterton said. "It’s a lot to ask of people." Our ruling Fight for the Future said, "215 members of Congress just voted to let your ISP spy on what type of underwear you buy and sell that data to advertisers." ISPs can see most of the websites their customers visit. Congress, with 215 votes from the House, sent a bill to Trump’s desk that codified ISPs’ ability to sell their customers' web browsing data, including any online underwear purchases that aren’t encrypted. Regulations enacted in 2016 would have required ISPs to ask customers for explicit permission to share this data with advertisers or other third parties. But Congress acted before the regulations went into effect. Fight for the Future’s phrasing — and use of the loaded term "spy" — might lead people to think that Congress’ action gave ISPs new freedoms, but they could always view and sell users’ web browsing information. Now they have Congress’ stamp of approval to do so without getting users’ permission first. That context is important, so we rate Fight for the Future’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-10625	"The fact is it's not amnesty."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/15/john-mccain/and-its-no-free-ride/	Sen. John McCain's immigration record has been a red flag for Republican primary voters both because it proposes granting legal status to most of the estimated 12-million illegal immigrants in the country and because McCain collaborated with liberal icon Sen. Edward M. Kennedy in developing it. During a Republican debate on Jan. 5, 2008, McCain accused Mitt Romney of mischaracterizing the plan by describing it as amnesty — defined as a general pardon of offenders by a government. "The fact is it's not amnesty," McCain said. "And for you to describe it as you do in the attack ads, my friend, you can spend your whole fortune on these attack ads, but it still won't be true." Now, understand that the word amnesty is freighted with implications that go beyond immigration policy. Throughout the immigration debate in Congress in recent years, opponents have routinely labeled as "amnesty" any provision that would give illegal immigrants a path to legal status. Many voters interpret it as giving criminals the equivalent of a "Get Out of Jail" card instead of diligently enforcing the law. Experts say its use here is designed to raise questions about whether McCain is willing to let rules slide and give lawbreakers access to social services and, more broadly, the American dream. "Amnesty means, 'He's not for America in the same way I am' … They're trying to reach the people who believe in America for Americans. It's almost a code word for something else: fear and uncertainty about the economy, the war, where America is in the world," said Audrey Singer, an immigration expert and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Back to McCain's charge that the immigration overhaul plan he and Kennedy introduced in 2006 is not amnesty: He's got a strong point, given the hurdles that plan contains. It would have required illegal immigrants to apply for a six-year conditional nonimmigrant visa. They then could apply for legal permanent residence — a green card — on the condition that they pay $1,000 in fines, pay all back taxes, pass a criminal background check, stay employed and demonstrate an effort to learn English and civics. They would also pay a $1,000 application fee. Because a green card holder must wait five years to apply for citizenship, this plan would make illegal workers eligible for citizenship 11 years after applying for the visa. Arlen Specter, senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and some other plan supporters have characterized the steps as "gates" that must be passed through before an illegal immigrant can qualify for citizenship. This is in contrast to what President Ronald Reagan did in 1986, when he signed an immigration reform bill that legalized the status of 1.7-million people. In checking a previous claim on that plan, we found it did qualify as amnesty. So, while McCain is more receptive to giving undocumented workers a path to citizenship than most of his GOP rivals, the many hurdles included in his plan do not qualify as a general pardon. We rule his statement True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-01-15T00:00:00	2008-01-05	['None']
pomt-08352	"I lost my health insurance and my doctor because of Obamacare."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/27/reid-ribble/republican-house-candidate-reid-ribble-says-he-los/	When it comes to federal health care reform, for many the biggest concern is the most personal one: Can they keep their doctor? During the fierce debate over the proposal, President Barack Obama repeatedly assured voters they could keep their doctors. Now comes Reid Ribble, a Republican challenging two-term U.S. Rep. Steve Kagen (D-Appleton) in a swing seat in northeastern Wisconsin. He’s got a bone to pick with the president. This was the headline on a recent news release: "Reid Ribble losing doctor, health insurance provider because of Obamacare." "I lost my health insurance and doctor because of Obamacare," Ribble says in the release. "If I am elected to Congress, I will go to Washington to make sure no one else loses their doctor because of Obamacare." That’s a powerful claim. And it could be potent, because Kagen -- who voted for the health care reforms -- is an allergist, prefers to be addressed as "Doctor" and includes "M.D." after his name on his official Congressional website. Let’s take a look at what happened. Ribble is chairman of The Ribble Group, which owns two Fox Valley roofing companies. Ribble says he sold the business last year to a relative, but an earlier PolitiFact Wisconsin item could not fully establish that was a fact. In any case, he remains chairman and a paid consultant. And he is covered by its health insurance carrier, Principal Financial Group. In September of 2010, Principal -- a Des Moines-based Fortune 500 company -- announced it was getting out of the health insurance business. Over the next 36 months, Principal will turn over coverage to UnitedHealth Group Co., one of the country’s largest health insurance providers. The change affects some 14,000 employers who provide coverage to 830,000 employees. For more than a decade, Ribble’s doctor has been N. Carter Noble, an Appleton-based family care physician who is part of the Affinity Medical Group. Principal has a coverage agreement with Affinity; UnitedHealth does not have an agreement with Affinity. Ribble’s coverage with Principal ends Dec. 31, 2010. That means Noble will be out of network if Ribble is covered by UnitedHealth. This is the central point cited in the campaign’s news release. So is Reid Ribble -- and presumably thousands of other Principal customers -- an early victim of health care reform? Hardly. Officials with Principal Financial told PolitiFact Wisconsin the decision was made because the company is primarily involved in retirement and asset management -- not health care. The company has $284.7 billion in assets under management, serves 18.9 million customers worldwide, and employs some 14,000 people. Health insurance generates about 3 percent of the company’s revenues, a percentage that is shrinking as other areas grow. "The medical business continues to be one that undergoes rapid change, which would mean investing additional capital into the business to be able to offer competitive products," Principal’s chairman and CEO Larry D. Zimpleman said at the time of the announcement. "For us, that just does not make sense." A Principal spokeswoman, Susan Houser, said Ribble should not blame health care reform for the company’s decision: "In addition to strategic fit going forward, we considered a number of other factors (including the regulatory environment), but our strategy and ability to invest in our growing businesses was the real driver. Our decision certainly did not hinge on (health care) reform, but it was among many factors." In fact, Susan Voss, the Iowa State Insurance Commissioner, said, "The issue of their leaving the health insurance market has been under review for almost a decade." Congress gave final approval to health care reform and Obama signed it into law last spring. Some provisions have kicked in already, while others are years away from taking effect. The provision that requires employer-provided insurers to spend at least 80 percent to 85 percent of their premiums on coverage takes effect in January 2011. The company’s decision got pulled into the national health care discussion after comments from another executive, Dan Houston, president of Principal’s retirement, insurance and financial services businesses. He told the Wall Street Journal that health care reform will make it more difficult for small insurers to compete. Here’s what the Journal wrote: "In the past, scale hasn’t mattered," said Mr. Houston. "But with administrative costs getting the focus," the company would have to grow significantly to stay in the business. The New York Times called Principal’s decision "another sign of upheaval emerging among insurers as the new federal health law starts to take effect." The story quoted two health care experts -- Len Nichols from George Mason University and Robert Laszewski, a consultant in Alexandria, Va. -- as saying more small insurers are likely to take similar steps. That may play out. But nowhere did it say that Principal was getting out of the business solely because of health reform, as Ribble suggests. So where does this leave Ribble? After all, he certainly isn’t the first consumer to have to figure out his medical care because companies changed coverage. The Ribble Group -- or Ribble on his own -- could choose another insurance carrier, one that includes Affinity in its network. Affinity has its own insurance company, Network Health Plan, and also accepts patients covered by Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield. Ribble could continue to see his doctor, but presumably pay more because he is out of network. Or, once the changeover is completed, Ribble could change doctors. Where does that leave us? Ribble says he lost his insurance and his doctor because of federal health care reforms -- a great line for voters. But a line just the same. Principal Financial Group says it made a decision to get out of the insurance business, which made up 3 percent of its revenues -- a share growing ever smaller as other aspects grew. What’s more, the decision was under consideration for years before Obama and his health reform plan came along. Ribble isn’t losing his insurance, his ability to get insurance or even, to be technical about it, his doctor. He and The Ribble Group have choices available -- including an insurance carrier run by his favored health care system. His statement forces us to call for the burn unit: Pants on Fire.

pomt-12858	"All of our taxpayers are paying roughly 22% of the U.N. budget."	true	/global-news/statements/2017/feb/01/rob-portman/us-contribution-un-22-percent/	The Donald Trump administration has drafted an executive order that would cut U.S. payments to the United Nations by as much as 40 percent. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, highlighted the substantial role the United States plays in funding the U.N. during the confirmation hearing for U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. "When all of our taxpayers are paying roughly 22 percent of the budget, I think they do expect to see a more efficient and an organization that's more objective and more in keeping with our values," Portman said on Jan. 18, 2017. "How do you intend to support U.S. national security interests, but also ensure that the U.N. is a more effective body toward promoting a more peaceful and less volatile world?" The U.N. and U.S. budget documents show Portman’s number is correct, and if peacekeeping is included, the percentage gets even higher. The current U.N. regular budget calls for $5.4 billion over two years. By a formula based on the size of a country’s economy and other factors, America’s assessment is set at 22 percent, or about $1.2 billion. Based on the last Obama administration budget, the United States provided $1.2 billion to the U.N. over two years, and Portman is correct. But that’s just for the U.N.’s regular budget. There are over a dozen other U.N. agencies and operations that American dollars also support. The single largest is peacekeeping with a price tag of about $7.8 billion this year alone. The U.S. share of that cost is over 28 percent, or $2.2 billion. The next three U.N. agencies -- all roughly in the $100 million per year range -- are the World Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the International Atomic Energy Agency. All told, the United States provides about $3.3 billion a year to finance U.N. activities. A 40 percent cut would save taxpayers about $1.3 billion out of the current $4.1 trillion U.S. federal budget. The impact on the U.N. would be substantial, although the precise effect would depend on how the cuts are spread around. Our ruling Portman said American taxpayers cover 22 percent of the U.N. budget. Budget documents from the U.N. and the United States confirm that. The percentage for peacekeeping operations is even higher.

pomt-09744	"You don't know if this (the H1N1 vaccine) is gonna cause neurological damage like it did in the 1970s."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/14/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-warns-1970s-flu-shots-caused-neurologic/	Radio and talk show host Glenn Beck has said he doesn't want to share his personal take on whether he will immunize his family with the H1N1 vaccine — the stakes are too high either way to give a personal opinion, he says — but he and some of his guests have repeatedly raised concerns about the safety of the vaccine. On his radio show on Oct. 8, Beck said, "You don't know if this (the H1N1 vaccine) is gonna cause neurological damage like it did in the 1970s." Beck refers here to a concern often raised by vaccine opponents, so we decided to give the claim some scrutiny. It is rooted in a 1976 swine flu outbreak at Fort Dix in New Jersey, which resulted in the death of a U.S. soldier. President Gerald Ford initiated a massive immunization effort that resulted in some 45 million Americans getting a swine flu vaccine. The flu never went beyond Fort Dix, and the immunization program was halted, but among those who got the vaccine, more than 500 people got a rare neurological illness called Guillain-Barre Syndrome, an auto-immune disease that affects the nervous system and can cause paralysis. Two dozen people died from it. Understandably, many Americans grew wary of flu vaccines, particularly since the swine flu never materialized outside Fort Dix. But was the flu vaccine really responsible for all those people developing Guillain-Barre? In 2003, the Institute for Medicine commissioned a medical panel, called the Immunization Safety Review Committee, to look into it. The issue is complicated by the fact that Guillain-Barre can be triggered by all kinds of influenza. So how much was the vaccine to blame? The panel concluded that "the evidence favored acceptance of a causal relationship" between the 1976 swine flu vaccine and Guillain-Barre in adults. However, the panel concluded that in the nearly 30 years of administering the seasonal flu vaccine since then, there was no proof that the vaccines had caused any more cases of Guillain-Barre, or any other neurological diseases, for that matter. "The evidence was at most weak that the vaccine could act in humans in ways that could lead to these neurological problems," the panel concluded. So what about the risk of the H1N1 vaccine now? Doctors say the track record of seasonal flu vaccines shows the new one is safe. "The vaccine was made essentially the same way vaccines have been made for the last 30 years," said Dr. Marie C. McCormick, a Harvard University professor who chaired that 2003 committee. Concerns about neurological issues with the H1N1 vaccine "are not based on the evidence we have at hand today," McCormick said. In addition to studies conducted by the five pharmaceutical companies that manufacture the H1N1 vaccine, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has conducted clinical trials on more than 4,000 people, and the only side effects recorded so far amount to little more than sore arms and stuffed-up noses. Still, that's a relatively small sample, too small to ferret out any possible connection to Guillain-Barre, which in 1976 was recorded in just 1 in every 100,000 people who got the vaccine. There's no denying that the swine flu vaccine in 1976 appeared to contribute to an outbreak of Guillain-Barre, said Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. But to raise that specter without talking about the ensuing 30 years needlessly stokes fears, he said. Since that 1976 experience, Osterholm said, the seasonal flu vaccine has been administered to 100 million to 250 million people a year worldwide, and there's been no evidence it caused anyone to get Guillain-Barre or any other neurological disorder. "At this point, we have no reason to believe it will," Osterholm said. "This vaccine was made essentially the same way we made the seasonal flu vaccines for more than 20 years. You have to put it into context." Put it this way, he said: His 31-year-old daughter is 6 months pregnant and works with children, and he is eager for her to get the vaccine. "That's about as objective as I can get," he said. Patricia Quinlisk, medical director of the Iowa Department of Public Health, said the only difference between the H1N1 vaccine and the regular seasonal flu shot is that it targets a different viral strain. In fact, had H1N1 showed up earlier, she said, it would have been included in the seasonal flu vaccine package. But by the time it appeared in May, the seasonal flu vaccine was already being made. Quinlisk also cautioned not to put much stock in the fact that the 1976 vaccine targeted swine flu, and the H1N1 has often been called the swine flu. The H1N1 is actually combination virus, mixing the typical swine flu with avian flu and typical human influenza. Can scientists give a 100 percent guarantee that no one getting the H1N1 vaccine will develop neurological problems? No, she said. There haven't been enough trials to definitively rule that out. "But do I think it's safer to get the vaccine than to risk getting the flu? Yes," she said. "If the H1N1 vaccine becomes available to me, I'm going to take it." That risk-reward ratio is markedly different than in 1976, she said. Then, the flu never spread beyond Fort Dix. "The H1N1 is here," she said. "It's a pandemic." We should also note that taking the H1N1 vaccine is being encouraged by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, both of which say the track record of seasonal flu vaccines over more than two decades suggest the H1N1 vaccine will be safe and effective. Beck is correct in that scientists say that in 1976, the swine flu vaccine likely caused Guillain-Barre in a very small number of adults. But Beck's statement lacks important context. The 30-year track record of seasonal flu vaccines strongly suggests the new H1N1 vaccine won't cause neurological damage. Without noting that the H1N1 vaccine has been manufactured in essentially the same way as the seasonal flu shot that has been used by hundreds of millions of people — without any established link to neurological problems — ends up misleading by omission. And so we rule Beck's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-13276	Says he won the second debate with Hillary Clinton "in a landslide" in "every poll."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2016/oct/12/donald-trump/donald-trumps-ridiculous-claim-all-polls-show-he-w/	Discord between Donald Trump and Paul Ryan -- sown by a video of Trump bragging in graphic terms about trying to have sex with women -- is continuing as the 2016 presidential campaign enters its final weeks. On Oct. 11, 2016, four days after the release of the 2005 video, the Republican nominee slammed the GOP House speaker from Wisconsin on Twitter (and later on the Fox News Channel). In the tweet, which came two days after his second debate with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Trump declared: "Despite winning the second debate in a landslide (every poll), it is hard to do well when Paul Ryan and others give zero support!" So, we thought we’d check the polls. Trump and Ryan The relationship between Trump and Ryan, never close, frayed after the video. Ryan denounced Trump’s remarks and canceled what would have been his first appearance with Trump at a rally in Wisconsin the following day. We rated True a claim by Clinton that Ryan still endorses Trump, but the ill will between the two Republicans remained. An hour after tweeting about the polls, Trump called Ryan in another tweet "our very weak and ineffective leader." The response from Ryan’s office: "Paul Ryan is focusing the next month on defeating Democrats, and all Republicans running for office should probably do the same." The debate Fiery exchanges between Trump and Clinton marked the second debate, which was held at Washington University in St. Louis. The town hall-style event drew more viewers nationally than the Green Bay Packers-New York Giants game, but fewer than the first debate. It generated more than two dozen fact checks by our colleagues. So, who did Americans say won the second debate? Here’s a look at the national, scientific polls: Poll Clinton Trump Politico/Morning Consult Registered voters 42% 28% NBC News/Survey Monkey Likely voters 44% 34% CNN/ORC International Registered voters who watched the debate 57% 34% YouGov (research company) Registered voters who watched the debate 47% 42% So, not only did Trump not win by a landslide in any of the polls, he didn’t win any of the polls, period. Trump’s campaign didn’t get back to us before deadline on what polls would back Trump’s statement. All we could find in his favor were non-scientific polls, open to anyone to participate, that were conducted online. But such polls can be heavily influenced, for instance, by campaigns pushing supporters to vote, or can skew to one side based on the audience of the website. Some may even allow more than one vote per person. The Drudge Report reported that among more than 1.1 million people who cast votes in its survey, 72 percent said Trump won and 28 percent said Clinton won. In a non-scientific poll offered online by MLive.com, the website for the Ann Arbor News and other newspapers in Michigan, Trump won by a margin of 61 percent to 39 percent among more than 27,000 votes cast. And in a non-scientific poll offered by the website of a group of New Jersey newspapers, Trump won 64 percent to 31 percent among more than 241,000 votes cast. For what they’re worth, those are landslide margins. But even in non-scientific surveys, Trump didn’t win them all: In a non-scientific survey done online by the Fox television affiliate in Milwaukee, Clinton won by 52 percent to 48 percent among 325,000 votes cast. Our rating Complaining about a lack of support from Ryan, Trump nonetheless claimed he won the second debate with Clinton "in a landslide" in "every poll." But four national, scientific surveys all showed that not only did Trump not win by a landslide margin, he didn’t win any of the polls at all.

pomt-06060	"She’s voted for 60 tax increases, hurting the middle class and small businesses."	pants on fire!	/oregon/statements/2012/jan/10/rob-cornilles/rob-cornilles-claims-suzanne-bonamici-has-voted-60/	Tax increases remain unpopular with voters so what better way to attack an opponent than with a commercial accusing that opponent of voting for a bunch of taxes? This is precisely what Republican Rob Cornilles has done in his latest television ad against Democrat Suzanne Bonamici. Both are vying in the Jan. 31 special election to fill the seat of former U.S. Rep. David Wu. Bonamici served in the Oregon Legislature from 2007-2011. Cornilles has not held elective office, so there are no votes to track. "She’s voted for 60 tax increases," says the female announcer in the campaign ad, "hurting the middle class and small businesses." We’ve been around long enough to know that Bonamici has voted to raise taxes, but 60 times? We had to check. The Cornilles campaign helpfully sent over a list of 62 bills to back up the claim. There were 26 votes during the 2007 session and 36 votes during the 2009 legislative session. The campaign did not calculate 2011 votes, saying that with a split Legislature there were few, if any, tax increases. In 2009, 29 of the 36 bills increased fees, and not taxes. We know that for some readers who dislike government surcharges, the difference doesn’t matter, even if the industry asked for the fee. Still we need to point out that fees differ from taxes in that the money doesn’t go into the general government fund. The money stays with the agency to pay for specific services. Think death certificate fees, hunting fees, land-use filing fees and psychologist license fees. The campaign ad specifically says "she voted for 60 tax increases." It would have been more accurate to say Bonamici voted for 60 tax and fee increases. Had that been all, we would rule more leniently. But then we moved backward to 2007 -- and our collective jaws dropped at the bills the Cornilles campaign included as "tax" votes. House Bill 2034 specifies who does and who does not have to register a vehicle and get an Oregon driver license. Senate Bill 416 reinforces the authority cities and counties have to decide which properties benefit from special property tax assessments. Apparently, this was included under the theory that taking away a tax exemption is the same as levying a tax. We respectfully disagree. But wait. There’s more, and these have nothing to do with tax increases, but with going after people who haven’t paid their taxes. Senate Bill 39 raises the penalty for people who don't report using certain mechanisms to lowball their tax liability. Senate Bill 175 shortens the period the Department of Revenue must wait before demanding a taxpayer file a tax report. Senate Bill 219 allows the Employment Department to provide information to the Transportation Department so tax collectors there can go after delinquent accounts. Finally, there are bills aimed at helping taxpayers. House Bill 2237 streamlines -- streamlines! -- the method for war veterans to get property tax exemptions. Senate Bill 653 allows tax-exempt entities like charities to claim exemptions for subleased property, same as leased property. We counted 14 of these Pinocchio-sized "tax" stretches out of 62 bills. We also counted 32 bills that increased fees, 13 bills that raised taxes (including federal connect and disconnect, and a public purpose charge), two bills that authorize tax increases but don’t actually increase them, and one that we honestly can’t figure out. In response, Mary Anne Ostrom, Cornilles’ campaign manager, conceded five bills should not have been included, including Senate Bill 416, but swapped in four bills from 2009 and 2011 that increased fees and one more from 2007 that increased taxes. By and large, Ostrom defended the others, arguing that any time there’s a new reporting requirement or reduction in filing time or higher penalties, the government is assessing new fees and taxes. So 2007’s Senate Bill 176, which allows the Department of Revenue to pursue outstanding taxes from a reorganized but essentially the same company, is counted as a new tax in the eyes of the Cornilles’ campaign. House Bill 2034, which requires residents of Oregon to register their vehicles and get an Oregon driver license after 30 days, is just another way to get more money -- fees -- out of people. Mike Carew, the campaign’s deputy, included legislation where he believes the government squeezed more money out of people. Even Senate Bill 196, which increases the penalty and punishment for people who cheat the state of unemployment benefits. For him, increased penalties equals increased fees, which equals taxes. "It’s a question of whether you consider a penalty or a fine a fee," Carew said. "I’m not saying it’s a bad bill, but before this bill was passed, those charges did not exist." Let’s go back to the commercial, which states that Bonamici "voted for 60 tax increases." It’s fair to say that Bonamici can’t recall ever voting against a tax increase or fee hike. It’s fair to say that she has one of the most liberal voting records in the Legislature. It’s fair to say that she has voted for big-ticket tax increases that have infuriated conservatives in Oregon. Cornilles could have stuck with that script and his statements would have been True. But there is no way she voted for 60 tax increases. After we started questioning, the Cornilles’ campaign unearthed one more tax vote, bringing the number of tax bills to 14, maybe 16 if you include votes to authorize toll language and to put before voters a measure to put a cigarette tax in the constitution. Still, 16 is a long, long way from 60. We can’t accept their explanation that punishing unemployment benefit cheats or allowing the state to go after people who haven’t paid taxes is a new tax or fee. Combine that reasoning with the heavy number of bills that increase fees rather than taxes and we have a statement that is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim. We rule it Pants on Fire.

pomt-14250	On banning assault weapons.	full flop	/texas/statements/2016/apr/12/donald-trump/donald-trump-fully-flip-flops-lately-opposes-ban-a/	Before finishing second to Texan Ted Cruz in Wisconsin’s April 2016 Republican presidential primary, Donald Trump of New York retweeted a supporter’s message stating: "Challenge to all WI gun owners. Vote @realDonaldTrump.The only candidate that will protect your rights!" That was an opinion; we can't check it. But the declaration didn’t impress Josh Perry, an aide to Sen. Cruz, who responded the day after the primary with tweets characterizing Trump as a flip-flopper on restricting assault weapons. Cue the Flip-O-Meter. Has Trump flip-flopped on banning assault weapons? "Remember when you advocated for stripping away my #2A rights?" Perry tweeted about Trump April 6, 2016, referring to the Second Amendment to the Constitution, which says: "A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed." Cruz’s aide earlier posted a tweet saying Trump had said: "I support the ban on assault weapons" and "a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun." Asked to elaborate, Perry told us in a Twitter message that he’d drawn Trump’s comments from the businessman’s 2000 book, "The America We Deserve," in which Trump wrote: "I generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun." The book came out as Trump mulled a possible run for president as a third-party hopeful. At the time, a 1994 congressionally-approved ban on the sale of semi-automatic weapons was due to lapse in 2004. Democratic attempts to resurrect the restrictions have not gained traction. Perry also pointed out a January 2016 news post on TheIntercept.com, which says it’s "dedicated to producing fearless, adversarial journalism." The post contrasted Trump’s support in 2000 for the assault-weapon ban and longer waiting periods with recent Trump proposals presented on his campaign website, including calls for law-abiding Americans to own the "firearm of their choice" and for state-issued concealed-carry permits allowing residents to carry handguns to be valid in every state. On his site, Trump also says members of the military should be able to freely carry weapons on bases and in recruiting stations. Trump also brings up assault-weapon restrictions, but not in a supportive way, saying: "Gun and magazine bans are a total failure. That’s been proven every time it’s been tried. Opponents of gun rights try to come up with scary sounding phrases like ‘assault weapons,’ ‘military-style weapons’ and ‘high-capacity magazines’ to confuse people. What they’re really talking about are popular semi-automatic rifles and standard magazines that are owned by tens of millions of Americans." That policy position showed up on the site in September 2015, according to an ABC News story at the time, which said: "The position on assault weapons represents a departure for Trump from a stance he held about 15 years ago." Trump’s site includes a section on the criminal background checks that residents who purchase guns at stores must complete. In the section, Trump advocates mental health records getting tied into the system. He’s silent on favoring or opposing slightly longer waiting periods before purchases are allowed though he indicates he doesn’t like the background-check system, saying: "When the system was created, gun owners were promised that it would be instant, accurate and fair. Unfortunately, that isn’t the case today." In 2016, TheIntercept.com reported, Trump "has vowed to undo President" Barack "Obama’s modest gun executive orders," per Trump’s remarks at a January 2016 New Hampshire stop, and also called for the elimination of school "gun-free zones." In Vermont in January, Trump said: "I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools, and — you have to — and on military bases. My first day, it gets signed, okay? My first day. There's no more gun-free zones." At the time, a Washington Post news story noted Trump had repeatedly said gun-free zones are a magnet for mentally ill shooters and that mass shootings in Paris and California could have been prevented if more citizens were armed to protect themselves and others. We used the text-search feature offered by Google Books to confirm Trump’s gun statements in his 2000 book. In the book’s brief section on guns, Trump said: "Democrats want to confiscate all guns, which is a dumb idea because only the law-abiding citizens would turn in their guns and the bad guys would be the only ones left armed. The Republicans walk the NRA line and refuse even limited restrictions." Next, Trump wrote, "I generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun. With today’s Internet technology we should be able to tell within 72 hours if a potential gun owner has a record." In a March 2016 debate, Trump was asked to speak to his published support for an assault-weapon ban. He replied: "I don’t support it anymore. I do not support the ban on assault" weapons, he said. We asked Trump’s campaign if he’d flip-flopped and didn’t immediately hear back. Our ruling Trump supported the assault-weapon ban in 2000. He opposes restrictions now. We rate this a FULL FLOP.

pomt-11264	Gavin Newsom was "the first to take on the National Rifle Association and win."	false	/california/statements/2018/apr/27/gavin-newsom/gavin-newsoms-false-claim-he-was-first-take-nra-an/	In 2016, the Democrat and frontrunner in the race for California governor led the passage of Proposition 63. The voter-approved measure imposed background checks on ammunition purchases and required a state license to sell ammunition, among other provisions. Gun rights groups opposed it. But did that effort qualify Newsom as "the first to take on the National Rifle Association and win"? That’s one of the claims in a new TV ad that aired statewide this week and was paid for by Newsom’s campaign. Here’s the full text: "The LA Times called Gavin Newsom ahead of the pack, from gay marriage to gun control. The first mayor to recognize marriage equality. The first to provide healthcare to every resident. The first to take on the National Rifle Association and win. The one candidate with a record of bold leadership and bold results. It’s why Kamala Harris, teachers, nurses and firefighters support Gavin Newsom for governor. Courage for a change." In an article earlier this week, we took a broad look at the claims in Newsom’s TV ad, a 30-second spot called "First." We also examined claims in a separate TV ad supporting former Los Angeles mayor and candidate for governor Antonio Villaraigosa. With this fact check, we’ll take a deeper look at the claim Newsom was "the first to take on the National Rifle Association and win." Haven’t other California politicos taken on the NRA and won? 'Hardly the first' In a column for CALmatters, Dan Morain summarized efforts by other Californians who pushed for gun safety measures — decades before Newsom. We used that summary as a guide and inspected additional gun control efforts in the state. As noted by Morain, Newsom was "hardly the first California big city politician to take on the NRA.". Sherry Bebitch Jeffee, professor of public policy at USC, added the claim about Newsom being "first," doesn’t hold up to the facts. "California’s been at the forefront of the gun control movement for a very long time," Jeffee said. Here’s a look at earlier efforts by prominent California politicians: Dianne Feinstein In 1983, then-San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein defeated an NRA-supported recall, Morain noted. The recall started after Feinstein backed a failed statewide initiative to regulate handguns. Feinstein’s signature gun control measure came two years into her career in the U.S. Senate. She introduced and helped pass the now-expired 1994 federal assault weapons ban, which was also opposed by the NRA. Tom Bradley In 1989, then-Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley signed a city ordinance that banned the sale or possession of semi-automatic weapons. Morain described that as "as a landmark bill at a time when the NRA was able to win elections in California." Antonio Villaraigosa Villaraigosa also has gun control credentials. In 1999, then-Assembly Speaker Villaraigosa helped pass a statewide assault weapons ban, though he did not author it. "The time is now to ban assault weapons," he was quoted as saying in a San Francisco Chronicle article at the time. "It is time to use the power of the Legislature to say with one loud voice that we should all move beyond Columbine." Luis Vizcaino, a spokesman for Villaraigosa’s campaign for governor, described the former LA mayor’s gun control efforts in a statement to PolitiFact California: "Mayor Villaraigosa has been taking on the NRA throughout his career. Under his speakership, California passed some of the boldest gun control measures in the country, including what was at the time the toughest assault weapons ban in the nation and greater oversight of gun shows -- all of which was vigorously opposed by the NRA." More from Newsom Newsom’s gun control history isn’t limited to 2016. During his time as San Francisco's mayor, Newsom signed into law the voter-approved Proposition H in 2005. It outlawed citizens from possessing handguns and prevented the manufacture, sale and distribution of guns and ammunition in the city. However, it was struck down by a San Francisco Superior Court judge less than a year after it was passed. In a phone interview earlier this week, Newsom’s campaign spokesman Nathan Click expanded on the claim that Newsom was "the first to take on the National Rifle Association and win." He clarified that it was intended to show Newsom was the "first person in California history to propose and pass a statewide ballot measure strengthening gun safety laws." As the claim is made in the ad, text appears showing a headline "Newsom Fights The NRA Over Gun Control." This appears to be a reference to an October 2017 Los Angeles Times news article with a similar headline. It describes Newsom’s request that a federal judge lift an order that blocked Proposition 63’s ban on large-capacity ammunition magazines. We didn’t find any information in the article or elsewhere showing Newsom’s argument swayed the judge to lift the order. "When you’re trying to convey a series of ideas in 30 seconds, you’re limited by the format," Click added. He said the ad did not intend to discount earlier accomplishments by other California politicians. While that’s helpful, PolitiFact places ratings on the original statements, not revisions or clarifications. Our ruling A TV advertisement by the Gavin Newsom for Governor campaign claimed Newsom was "the first to take on the National Rifle Association and win." The claim, however, ignores major gun control measures passed by California politicians from U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein to former Los Angeles mayors Tom Bradley and Antonio Villaraigosa, in the face of NRA opposition. Newsom’s campaign spokesman said the claim in the ad was meant to convey a more specific accomplishment, showing Newsom as the first to push through a statewide gun safety ballot measure. We’re not challenging that statement. But we rate the original claim as False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. UPDATE: The Newsom campaign says it has not pulled its "First" TV ad that includes the claim PolitiFact California rated False. A spokesman told us after our fact check published that the campaign is running a separate TV ad that omits the claim in question but was produced back in February, and not in response to any factual concerns. We wrote an article here to clarify that there are two Newsom TV ads.

pomt-02680	Payday lenders profit "from the poor by charging 1,000-plus" percent "interest."	half-true	/texas/statements/2014/jan/08/wendy-davis/certain-payday-loans-had-effective-interest-rates-/	Wendy Davis called for a Republican appointee’s head while maintaining that payday lenders sock consumers with extremely high charges. In a Dec. 30, 2013, press release, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate said William White, a Cash America International Inc. vice president, "can’t protect Texas consumers while he represents a predatory lending company on the side." White, an appointee of Gov. Rick Perry, has chaired the Texas Finance Commission, which oversees the state credit commissioner, since 2009. Davis piped up in reaction to White’s comments as quoted in a Dec. 29, 2013, El Paso Times news article stating. According to the story, White said that individuals who take payday loans are responsible for their decisions, not lenders. "There's nobody out there that forces anybody to take any kind of loan," White said. Davis’ campaign press release noted that in 2011, Davis said: "It’s really disgusting that an industry that profits from the poor by charging 1,000-plus interest is put at the head of the state’s financial regulatory agency. It’s saying, ‘It’s not only OK, but we’re going to put them in charge.’ " It’s no secret that payday loans—the idea being that such loans are often being repaid from a future pay check—are costly. But 1,000-plus percent costly? Davis campaign back-up The same Jan. 20, 2011, story that initially quoted Davis making this claim, published in the liberal Texas Observer, preceded her comment by saying: "Cash America and other payday lending companies advertise heavily on street corners in low-income neighborhoods and offer easy cash on the Internet to borrowers in financial crisis. These ‘easy’ loans carry jacked-up fees and exorbitant interest rates. In Texas, an eight-day payday loan carries a 1,153 percent annual rate—one of the highest in the nation," the story said. That story did not list a source for that declared rate. To our inquiry, a Davis campaign spokeswoman, Rebecca Acuña, emailed us published commentaries and research articles in support of the senator’s claim. One of the advocacy pieces led us to a March 18, 2013, report by Texans for Public Justice on lobbyists for the state’s "runaway predatory lenders." The report said: "Although Texas prohibits usurious interest rates, companies dodge these protections by organizing as unregulated middlemen. So-called ‘credit service organizations’ link borrowers to lenders, who comply with state interest-rate caps. After the middlemen tag on exorbitant fees and arrange repeated rollovers, however, loans secured by paychecks or car titles can carry annual effective interest rates exceeding 1,000 percent." National perspective We sought broader analyses. Nationally, according to "fast facts" about payday lenders as posted online by the Center for Responsible Lending, a North Carolina-based nonprofit that says it "works to protect homeownership and family wealth by fighting predatory lending practices," the typical two-week payday loan has an effective annual interest rate ranging from 391 to 521 percent. Also, the center says, the typical payday borrower remains in loan debt for 212 days. "Payday loans are small loans marketed as a quick, easy way to tide borrowers over until the next payday," the center says. "However, the typical payday loan borrower is indebted for more than half of the year with an average of nine payday loan transactions at annual interest rates over 400%." The center notes separately that Congress in 1968 came up with a way of gauging the full impact of such loans by imposing the APR, or Annual Percentage Rate of interest, "as a standard measure that calculates the simple interest rate on an annual basis (including most fees), accounts for the amount of time the borrower has to repay the loan, and factors in the reduction in principal as payments are made over time. … The intent was to give consumers an accurate measure of the cost of the various credit options they might be considering, so that they need not pay unnecessarily high rates of interest or be caught in loans with hidden fees or arduous terms that make it more difficult to pay off the loan." The Texas experience And what’s the deal in Texas? In telephone interviews, experts including a state administrator told us Texas state law restricts interest rates on consumer loans. However, payday loan fees are uncapped, which has enabled so-called middleman groups to charge the equivalent of hundreds of points of interest. And in 2012, some Texas payday loan rates exceeded 1,000 percent, according to a Feb. 18, 2013, presentation to the Texas House Pensions, Investments & Financial Services Committee by the Office of the Consumer Credit Commissioner. In each quarter of 2012, according to the presentation, there were more than 700,000 payday loans in the state—more than 80 percent of them for single-installment paybacks on which the effective annual rate rose from 446 percent in the first quarter of the year to 465 percent in the fourth quarter. More dramatically, the effective annual rate for multiple-installment loans spiked from 699 percent in the first quarter to 1,018 percent in the second quarter, falling to 900 percent in the third quarter and 513 percent in the fourth quarter, according to the presentation, though the related chart included a footnote warning of a "low level of confidence in these figures due to suspected inaccurate, and unverifiable, reporting of average loan fees per $100 borrowed." The presentation also included an agency leaflet, revised in December 2012, depicting payday loans as the most expensive way to borrow money while indicating related interest costs of 450 percent to 700 percent. By email, Rudy Aguilar, director of consumer protection for the Texas consumer credit commissioner, pointed out that one company, CashNetUSA, has declared online that its payday loans can result in borrowers facing an APR of 664 percent, while Fort Worth-based Cash America, Inc., has aired a 14-day APR on Texas payday loans of 533 percent. Aguilar also noted a declaration by Utah-based Check City that lists effective APRs of 271 percent to 1,124 percent and 1,151 percent depending on how long loans are taken out (35 days to as few as nine or eight days). By telephone, Aguilar said it’s his anecdotal impression that there are few instances of borrowers facing annual rates adding up to more than 1,000 percent. "I have not seen a lot of loans with that type of APR. I’ve certainly seen (them) in the 500 to 700 percent range," Aguilar said. "If you do run into a 1,000 or better APR, it’s going to be in the realm of the exception rather than the rule." 'We know they exist' Proponents of restrictions on payday loan costs said there isn’t sufficient data to tell how many Texans have paid effective rates exceeding 1,000 percent. "But we know they exist," analyst Ann Baddour of Texas Appleseed said by email. Also, she pointed out an online post by Ace Cash Express indicating it levies an effective rate of 918 percent (close to 1,000 percent) to repay a payday loan of $600 over five weeks. By email, Don Baylor of the liberal Center for Public Policy Priorities pointed out its Sept. 18, 2013, report indicating that on average, Texans taking out single-installment payday loans in 2012 borrowed $468 over 19 days at an effective rate of 439 percent. Baylor said the center’s calculation is that some payday loans exceed 1,000 percent APR, while nearly half of single-payment payday loans exceed 500 percent APR. Our ruling Davis said payday lenders charge 1,000-plus percent interest. The effective annual rate of such loans in Texas, taking into account uncapped fees, can exceed 1,000 percent, but that’s not been common. For three months in 2012, the average effective annual rate for payday loans repaid in multiple installments exceeded 1,000 percent. Yet average effective rates for such loans were otherwise lower, while such rates for considerably more prevalent single-installment loans topped out at an average of 465 percent. We rate this partly accurate claim as Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-04617	Says when Mitt Romney was governor, Massachusetts was 47th in job creation	half-true	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/sep/17/jeanne-shaheen/jeanne-shaheen-cites-poor-job-creation-new-hampshi/	As political commentators debated whether the Democratic National Convention would give President Barack Obama a significant "bump" in the race for the White House, U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen indicated Obama at least has Granite Staters’ support. The former governor of New Hampshire, identified as a "longtime friend and ally" of Clinton, was a guest on a segment of MSNBC’s The Daily Rundown called "The Clinton Contribution" leading up to the former president’s speech in Charlotte on Sept. 5. During the three-minute spot, Shaheen predicted that Clinton would show how Obama best identifies with middle America’s concerns, and discussed the close 2012 presidential race in her swing state. "This election is close everywhere and I think New Hampshire reflects that," Shaheen said. "But the fact that Barack Obama is still leading slightly in New Hampshire despite the fact that -- that Mitt Romney has a home there, that he was governor of Massachusetts, our neighboring state, I think is a reflection of people’s remembering what Romney did in Massachusetts. You know, when he was governor, Massachusetts was 47th in job creation, so we need better than that in a president." PolitiFact has had heard this claim about Bay State job creation under Romney more than once. In fact, the day before Shaheen cited the statistic, PolitiFact gave Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, the Democrat who succeeded Romney in 2006, a Half True for using it in his speech at the convention. PolitiFact New Hampshire reached out to Shaheen about the claim. Spokesperson Faryl Ury cited a Market Watch story from February 2010 that cites U.S. Labor Department statistics showing Massachusetts ranked fourth from last in the country in jobs growth from January 2003 to January 2007 -- Romney’s time in office. But the article failed to present any new data that would challenge what has been deemed a partially accurate Democratic talking point for more than a year. Here’s a quick summary: PolitiFact handed Obama’s campaign adviser David Axelrod a Half True for the same claim in June 2011. And nearly a year later, Axelrod earned another Half True for repeating it. Democrats have repeated the statement so many times, the Romney campaign came up with a counterattack -- that Massachusetts under Romney initially ranked last among states in job growth, but by the end of his governorship, "we were in the middle of the pack." That got a Half True as well. PolitiFact’s usual approach is to look at the claim in two parts: First, are the numbers correct, and second, how much was the change because of Romney's policies? We used state-level statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source of employment data, specifically figures for non-farm jobs, seasonally adjusted. And because the Massachusetts governor takes office in early January, we used the data for December of each year as a baseline. From December 2002 to December 2006, Massachusetts ranked 47th out of 50 states (not including the District of Columbia) in job growth. (We calculated that by using the number of jobs at the beginning and end of the period for each state to determine the percentage change and then ranking the states.) Only Ohio, Louisiana and Michigan fared worse. So the number is correct. But does Romney deserve credit for the job situation? This is an issue we've addressed often at PolitiFact with governors from many states. Economists have consistently told us that policies of a governor have a relatively small impact on a state's economy. For instance, the country was coming out of a recession when Romney took office. And it's likely that Massachusetts emerged more slowly from that recession because its pre-recession numbers were disproportionately inflated by the technology bubble, said Michael Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, an independent group that analyzes fiscal trends in the state. A lot of those tech jobs never came back. Widmer warned us when we first looked at Axelrod’s 47th-in-the-nation claim in June 2011 not to put too much stock in any governor's influence over their state's rate of job growth. The ability for governors to manage the state economy is vastly overrated, Widmer said. States are tied to larger economic forces, he added, and governors often claim too much credit when things are going well and no blame when things are going poorly. Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, echoed that point. "Presidents, governors, and mayors can have an impact on job creation during their terms in office," he said. "Almost always, however, the impact is small in relation to the effects of events and trends over which elected officials have little control, especially in their first few years on the job. A recession that is underway or begins soon after a president or governor takes office is in no way the fault of the new officeholder. The flip side is that chief executives cannot claim much credit for a strong economic recovery that begins shortly before or after they take the oath of office. The conditions that made the recovery possible were already present when their term in office began. The executive’s policies may have speeded or slowed the recovery around the margins, but the conditions that caused the recovery to begin were already present before the oath of office was administered." (As we’ve noted before, Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.) Our ruling It’s correct that Massachusetts ranked 47th of 50 in job creation on Romney’s watch. However, Shaheen -- like Democrats before her and the Romney camp in its rebuttal -- exaggerates Romney’s influence on the state job market. Governors simply don't have that much impact. Shaheen gets a Half True.	None	Jeanne Shaheen	None	None	None	2012-09-17T12:11:45	2012-09-05	['Massachusetts', 'Mitt_Romney']
pomt-00139	"The illegal caravan of immigrants are flying the Honduras flag as they burn the American flag as they march towards the USA wanting asylum!"	pants on fire!	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/oct/25/blog-posting/viral-flag-burning-photos-are-not-migrant-caravan-/	Are Central American refugees hoping to relocate to the United States desecrating the stars and stripes as they head north? "The illegal caravan of immigrants are flying the Honduras flag as they burn the American flag as they march towards the USA wanting asylum!" claims a Facebook post shared more than 20,000 times on the social media site. "They are not asylum seekers! They are invaders!" This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It’s accompanied with three images, one showing a man’s face as he lights a flag on fire, another of a flag burning on the ground, and a third of a man holding a burning flag surrounded by a group. But the photos aren’t from Mexico, where the migrants are now walking toward the southern border. The first image is the thumbnail used on Fox News TV reports on an anti-Trump protest in New Mexico that turned violent in May 2016. And the flag isn’t an American flag but a Trump flag. "Trump for president 2016," it says. "Make America Great Again!" The second photo was taken by Dan Kitwood, a Getty Images photographer who took a picture of a flag burning outside the American embassy in London during a protest in September 2010. As a stock image, it has been repurposed in subsequent stories, like one about Judge John Bates and a Deadspin article about "movies that made us feel crappy about America." The third photo is care of Reuters, and shows protesters burning the American flag outside the Republican National Convention in 2016. On Oct. 19, two people burned an American flag "during a protest in favor of the caravan of migrants," according to a caption to an Associated Press photo that shows two men holding the corners of a burning flag with a swastika scrawled on it. But that happened in front of the American embassy in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, when the caravan was stuck at the Guatemala-Mexico border. We haven’t found credible reports of other instances of flag-burnings connected to the caravan, and no stories of migrants making the march north burning the American flag themselves. As some Americans fret about the growing group en route to the U.S.-Mexico border, this post misuses old, unrelated photos of flag-burnings and wrongly feeds fears of an invasion.

pomt-07746	Says the Hawaii governor "can’t find anything that says (President Barack Obama) was born in Hawaii."	false	/texas/statements/2011/feb/27/leo-berman/state-rep-leo-berman-says-hawaii-governor-cant-fin/	CORRECTION, 9:38 a.m. Feb. 27, 2011: Our initial posted article had an incorrect first reference to the fact-checking entity that reviewed the birth certificate aired by Barack Obama's campaign. That research was done by FactCheck.org. The text is correct below. State Rep. Leo Berman says that his proposed bill to require presidential candidates to show their birth certificates to the Texas secretary of state reflects doubts about President Barack Obama’s birthplace. "We don’t think the president was vetted, and it’s just that simple," Berman, R-Tyler, is quoted as saying in a Feb. 14 Politico article about similar proposals pending in some other states. "I read different things that say he was born in Hawaii, and then I read the governor (of Hawaii) can’t find anything that says he was born in Hawaii." A subset of Obama critics, dubbed "birthers," doubt that he is a natural-born U.S. citizen, a requirement to serve as president, and question the validity of his Hawaii birth document. That’s an old claim, shot down by PolitiFact National and FactCheck.org, which concluded that that a document aired by Obama's campaign is authentic. We won’t revisit that question. Still, Berman’s claim that Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie couldn’t vouch for Obama’s birth in the Aloha State was a new one to us. When we asked Berman about it, he replied: "I just listen to the news, I don’t write it down. It’s been on several news stations that he (Abercrombie) said he was going to resolve this once and for all and when he tried to ... he couldn’t find anything." Berman’s public comments have previously put him in "birther" company. In a Nov. 17 Lubbock Avalanche-Journal news article, Berman said his proposal was necessary "because we have a president whom the American people don’t know whether he was born in Kenya or some other place." It’s undisputed, as posted on the White House website, that Obama’s late father was born in Kenya. But back to Hawaii: In 2008, in response to questions about Obama’s birthplace, his campaign released a copy of his "Certification of Live Birth" from Hawaii and posted it online. The document states that Barack Hussein Obama II was born on at 7:24 p.m. Aug. 4, 1961, in Honolulu to parents Stanley Ann Dunham and Barack Hussein Obama. Birthers, though, said the posted document was a shortened version of a birth certificate, questioning why the original, "long form" documentation of birth was not released. According to a Dec. 24 New York Times news article, Abercrombie, who was elected Hawaii’s governor in November, was angered by the persistent skepticism that Obama was born in the United States and planned to seek ways to release additional proof that his birthplace was Hawaii. "It’s an insult to his mother and to his father, and I knew his mother and father; they were my friends, and I have an emotional interest in that," Abercrombie told the Times. Next, we searched for the reports that Berman mentioned. Online, we found numerous Web pages with the headline "Hawaii Governor Can’t Find Obama’s Birth Certificate." Many linked to a Jan. 18 article by the conservative WorldNetDaily.com, a locomotive on the birther train, that was based on comments that Abercrombie made to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. The WorldNetDaily story begins: "Abercrombie suggested in an interview published today that a long-form, hospital-generated birth certificate for Barack Obama may not exist within the vital records maintained by the Hawaii Department of Health." The story continues: "Abercrombie did not report to the newspaper that he or the Hawaii Department of Health had found Obama's long-form, hospital-generated birth certificate. The governor only suggested his investigations to date had identified an unspecified listing or notation of Obama's birth that someone had made in the state archives." In the Star-Advertiser’s Jan. 18 published interview with Abercrombie, the governor was asked about his plan to release more information regarding Obama's birth certificate. He responded that he wants to use information from the state archives about Obama’s birth. "This is what our investigation is showing, it actually exists in the archives, written down," Abercrombie said. We called and e-mailed Abercrombie’s office about this and did not hear back. Meanwhile, we found another report that Abercrombie couldn’t find proof that Obama was born in Hawaii. On Minnesota’s KQRS-FM radio Jan. 20, Hollywood reporter Mike Evans, claiming to be a longtime friend of Abercrombie’s, said the governor had told him that he had searched "everywhere" at Hawaii hospitals and that "there is no Barack Obama birth certificate in Hawaii. Absolutely no proof at all that he was born in Hawaii." The same day, Evans made the claim on Austin’s KLBJ-AM. Six days later, though, FoxNews.com quoted Evans as saying that he had misspoken. According to FoxNews.com, Evans said that he called Abercrombie’s office after reading online reports that the governor couldn’t find Obama’s birth certificate but that Abercrombie did not return his call. "I haven’t talked to Neil since he’s been governor," Evans said. Meanwhile, The Associated Press reported that Abercrombie’s office had ended its effort to make public more information about Obama’s birth. The story does not say that Abercrombie had failed to find evidence of Obama’s birthplace, but that the state’s attorney general had told the governor that he can't disclose birth documentation without the person's consent. "There is nothing more that Gov. Abercrombie can do within the law to produce a document," Abercrombie spokeswoman Donalyn Dela Cruz said. We wondered whether Abercrombie sought Obama’s permission to obtain more proof of his birth. The White House wouldn’t comment, but Abercrombie told CNN on Dec. 27 that "we haven’t had any of those discussions." Per the authenticity of the document posted online by Obama, our colleagues at PolitiFact National pointed out July 1, 2009, that FactCheck.org, a respected fact-checking unit at the University of Pennsylvania, had traveled to Chicago to examine the document and concluded that it’s legitimate. Janice Okubo, a spokeswoman for the Hawaii Department of Health, told our colleagues that too much was being made of the difference between the so-called "long" and "short" forms. "When you request a birth certificate, the one you get looks exactly like the one posted on his site," she said. "That's the birth certificate." According to a Nov. 1, 2008, FactCheck.org article, the "long" form is created by the hospital while the "short" form is printed by the state and draws from a database with less information. FactCheck.org also noted that the state’s birth record request form does not have an option for requesting a long-form birth certificate. The Hawaii Health Department maintains a Web page devoted to questions about Obama’s "vital records." It says that copies of vital records — which pertain to birth, death, marriage, etc. — can only be obtained by someone with a "direct and tangible interest" in the record. However, the public can view "index data" based on those records in a department office in Honolulu or request it by mail. The page says that "the index data regarding President Obama is: Birth Index // Obama II, Barack Hussein // Male." Rewind: Berman didn’t pinpoint where he heard or read that Hawaii’s governor couldn’t find proof of Obama’s birthplace. We combed published reports, finding no proof Abercrombie said that. We rate Berman’s statement False.	None	Leo Berman	None	None	None	2011-02-27T06:00:00	2011-02-14	['Hawaii', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-01778	The states that are doing "better" are the ones that have no state income tax.	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/28/jamie-weinstein/are-states-without-income-tax-doing-better-ones-do/	Bill Maher used the latest jobs numbers out of Kansas as an occasion for his "Zombie Lies" segment about what he calls "lies that Republicans tell that you can debunk, but they do not go away." One such "zombie lie," Maher said, is "trickle-down economics, the idea that you cut taxes for rich people and then the job creators get job creating and then the economy just blooms." The latest nail in Maher’s zombie coffin is the "revenue collapse" Kansas is facing after its Legislature passed 25 percent cuts to individual tax rates in 2012. Jamie Weinstein, senior editor for the Daily Caller, came to the defense of the supply-siders. "It’s too early to make a declarative judgment" on Kansas’ tax cuts, Weinstein said. "There’s been studies of nine states that have no income state tax versus nine states with the highest state income tax. Which do you think have done better? It’s not the states with the highest state income tax." Millions of words have been spilled arguing about the effect taxes have on the economy. We can’t resolve that debate here, but we wanted to check Weinstein’s claim that the nine states with no state income tax outperformed the nine states with the highest state income taxes. It turns out there are metrics that support Weinstein’s point -- and others that contradict it. Arthur Laffer Weinstein told us he was referring to a study from the Laffer Center for Supply-Side Economics authored by Arthur Laffer, the so-called "father of supply-side economics," and Stephen Moore, another pre-eminent supply-side economist. Laffer’s argument in "Taxes Really Do Matter" has been persuasive. He actually helped design the Kansas tax cuts that Weinstein was defending, and Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback seemed to refer to Laffer’s research when he said that "pro-growth states with no state income taxes … are among the country’s strongest economic performers." Laffer and Moore analyzed nine "no-tax" states (Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, Wyoming, Tennessee and New Hampshire) and compared them to nine "high-tax" states (California, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon and Vermont). Laffer and Moore look at the average growth from 2001-10 for each set of states in four factors: population, Gross State Product (GSP: GDP but for states), employment, and state and local tax revenue. By each of these four measures, the nine states without an income tax outperform the high-tax states. Another way to look at it So Weinstein cited Laffer’s study accurately. But there is more to the story. Dick Lavine, a senior fiscal analyst at the left-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities, said Laffer’s measures are not what economists usually use to judge a state’s success. "The trouble with Laffer’s study is that fast-growing states look good by his measure mainly because of population growth, not because of any excellence in the economy." The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) -- a research group that partners with Citizens for Tax Justice, which advocates for the tax interests of middle- and lower-class families -- responded to Laffer’s research with its own study, "‘High rate’ Income Tax States Are Outperforming No-Tax States." The results, as you might imagine, are 100 percent opposite of the Laffer analysis. Whereas the Laffer Center study looks at raw totals, ITEP looked at three per capita statistics that Ralph Martire, executive director of the Center for Tax and Budget Accountability, called "the three major economic indicators." "The nine states with the highest individual income tax rates had better change in median wage (-0.7 percent to -3.5 percent) and significantly better growth in state GSP per capita (10.1 percent to 8.7 percent)," Martire said, while "no-tax states had marginally better unemployment." Other factors While the Laffer Center study argues that population is a valid measure for economic growth -- they look in particular at migrants between high-tax and no-tax states -- it’s tough to attribute that growth solely to the absence of an income tax. "The majority of population growth is natural increase," Lavine said, noting that Texas and Florida have relatively high Latino populations, who statistically have more kids per family. Eight of the no-tax states are also in the South and West, which have seen their populations increase since the popularization of air conditioning after World War II. Even setting aside population, income tax alone doesn’t capture the full difference between states, said Jay Ritter, professor of finance at the University of Florida. "As the ITEP notes, some states have no income taxes because they can generate revenue from taxing tourists or taxing oil extraction," Ritter said. "Lowering income tax rates or eliminating them does attract residents, but if lower revenue is generated, at least in the short run, the state has to either increase other taxes or cut expenditures." Texas, for example, has particularly high local property taxes and is also having problems funding its school system, according to the New York Times. Scott Drenkard, an economist for the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, noted that differences between states make it hard to draw conclusions just from the Laffer Center’s nine versus nine comparison. Case studies "can be fruitful," Drenkard said, "but you should be careful to try to compare apples-to-apples as much as possible." Our ruling Defending Kansas’ tax cuts, Weinstein claimed that the states that are doing "better" are the ones that have no income state tax. Weinstein is accurately citing a study by the Laffer Center that compares states on their growth in population, GSP, total jobs, and total state and local tax revenue. To Laffer, no-tax states are besting high-tax states. But we found another study from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy that concluded the exact opposite, by using a different set of measurements. In the end, measuring "better" ultimately is in the eye of the beholder, and we’re not going to settle this economics debate. But Weinstein isn’t going to either. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-07897	Nevada will be "energy independent within the immediate future."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/03/harry-reid/harry-reid-says-nevada-will-be-energy-independent-/	In a recent TV interview, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid made a striking claim about his home state. Reid said Nevada will be "energy independent within the immediate future." During the Jan. 18, 2011, interview, Nevada political journalist Jon Ralston asked Reid how soon Nevada can start exporting its energy to other states. "It’s going to take a while, but some of that is happening right now," Reid said, citing a power line between northern and southern Nevada that’s in the works. "California has a rule that one-third of all their electricity by the year 2020 must come from renewable sources," Reid said. "They simply can’t do it. So we will be the chief state that they will import their energy from." Ralston prodded, "How long is it going to take to get that to happen?" "I would say within the next three or four years," Reid responded. "That fast?" Ralston asked. "Oh yeah, we are going to be able to be energy independent within the immediate future," Reid said. We decided to see if the senator was correct. We began by contacting the Nevada State Office of Energy, which keep statistics on the state's energy sources, but Spokesman Sean Sever said his agency "doesn't have anything to prove or disprove this statement." So we turned to Scot Rutledge, the executive director of the Nevada Conservation League and Education Fund, a leading environmental group in the state. Rutledge was skeptical. He said that Nevada could stop importing coal by shutting down a few plants in northern Nevada, and the state does have enough geothermal resources to theoretically replace fossil-fuel powered plants, particularly natural gas. "But that would take longer than three to four years," he said. In the meantime, Nevada does have impressive solar resources, and if the state developed sufficient storage capacity, that might be enough to provide 24-hour electricity for homes and businesses. But being a net exporter of energy does not necessarily mean being "energy independent." That’s because cars, trucks and airplanes have to run on fuel, too -- and the state does not have enough oil for that. "We would need to convert every vehicle on the road to electric," Rutledge said, and then provide fuel obtained in-state for airplanes. All told, Rutledge said, it’s conceivable that Nevada might be able to export more energy than it imports "over the next seven to 10 years, but I don't think that is a true definition of energy independence." Rutledge speculated that Reid may simply have been overzealous in echoing comments from 2008 by former President Bill Clinton. Clinton told a national clean-energy summit-- held in Nevada and co-sponsored by Reid -- that the state could one day become energy independent, as could such countries as Liberia, Rwanda, East Timor and Papua New Guinea. At the same summit, Reid said in a speech that "the sun shines here all the time. The wind blows much of the time, and we're one of the few states that has massive amounts of geothermal energy. That's why I refer to Nevada as the Saudi Arabia of renewable energy. Tax incentives and upgraded transmission capacity could make the goals set forth for Nevada a reality." Indeed, when we contacted Reid’s office, spokesman Jon Summers repeated the theme of Nevada as a huge repository of untapped energy. Reid "has a vision of Nevada leading the nation in clean energy production," Summers said. "He’s been responsible for hundreds of millions of dollars in investment in the state’s clean energy industry. Nevada’s north-to-south transmission line, which is expected to be completed in less than three years, will allow the state’s population centers to secure clean energy from rural areas and even export it outside the state. In his interview, Sen. Reid said he thinks that energy independence is going to take a while but some of it is already happening." We’ll grant that in the interview, the discussion began with the question of how fast Nevada can begin exporting energy out of the state. But Reid went on to say the state would be "energy independent within the immediate future," which means all of the state’s energy would be produced within its own boundaries. Even if Nevada successfully taps into its solar and other energy resources, it is many years away from changing all of its cars, trucks and planes from fossil fuels to fuels that can be produced within the state. So we rate Reid’s statement False.	None	Harry Reid	None	None	None	2011-02-03T17:24:05	2011-01-18	['None']
pomt-12806	Israel cut its illegal immigration rate by "99 percent" by constructing a 143-mile fence along its southern border.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/13/ron-johnson/border-fence-israel-cut-illegal-immigration-99-per/	Need an example of a border wall that works? Look to Israel, President Donald Trump has repeatedly said. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., echoed the idea during a Feb. 3 CNN interview, claiming that a border fence in Israel has drastically cut illegal immigration along its southern border. "Israel ... had a real problem with illegal immigrants coming in from the southern border, about 16,000 in one year. In two years, they constructed 143-mile fence, about $2.9 million per mile, and it cut that illegal immigration rate from about 16,000 to I think 18. Cut it by 99 percent," Johnson said. The United States needs to pay attention to Israel and how it has handled security issues, Johnson said. "They are under a constant state of threat. Threat of terrorism. They've dealt with it pretty effectively. We need to learn those lessons," Johnson added. Since Trump has signed an executive order to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, we were curious about references to Israel’s border efforts and their success, as described by Johnson. Here’s what we found. Israel-Egypt border fence Israel has built multiple barriers along its borders with Egypt, Lebanon, Gaza Strip and West Bank, all as safeguards against terrorism and illegal immigration. In 2015, we looked into a claim from another Wisconsin official, Gov. Scott Walker, when he said that a 500-mile fence between Israel and the West Bank was to thank for a 90 percent reduction in terrorist attacks in Israel. Experts then told us that even though there had been a drop in terrorism, the data used for Walker’s analysis was outdated and the fence was only one reason for the decline. Johnson was specifically talking about a fence along the Israeli-Egyptian border. Johnson’s team referred us to a January 2013 article in the Jerusalem Post about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu touring a completed 143-mile fence along the Sinai border. The article noted that an additional 8 miles of fencing was still to be completed along mountainous terrain near Eilat. When fully completed, the fence would run from Kerem Shalom (where Sinai and Israel meet the Gaza Strip) to Taba on the Red Sea, according to the article. Fence construction started in November 2010 and came with a price tag of 1.6 billion Israeli shekels, the Jerusalem Post reported. The senator's office said an Israeli official told Johnson that the fence cost $415 million during a tour while Johnson was in Israel. (The Wall Street Journal in January 2013 pegged the fence’s cost at $416 million.) To determine a $2.9 million cost per mile, Johnson divided $415 million into the 143 completed miles cited in the 2013 article. (The cost per mile goes down to about $2.7 million when factoring in the total project of about 150 miles.) So Johnson appears largely correct about the cost of the wall. How about its success in keeping people trying to cross the border illegally out? That number checks out, too. This month, Johnson, who chairs the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, released a report titled "Securing Israel: Lessons learned from a nation under constant threat of attack." The report came after a trip Johnson made to Israel where he met the Israeli prime minister and other security officials. The report notes that the number of people illegally crossing the Israel-Egypt border was more than 16,000 in 2011 and less than 20 in 2016, a 99 percent decrease. Netanyahu recently touted his country’s southern barrier and gave a nod to Trump, tweeting on Jan. 28, "President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Experts we reached out to agree that illegal immigration along Egypt’s southern border has indeed significantly dropped in the years after the fence was built and that Johnson's assessment of its costs and timeframe are sound. However, they warn against generalizing that the fence is the sole reason for the drop and raise objections in comparing Israel’s border issues to those in the United States. The success of barriers such as a wall or fence depend on their scale and how heavily guarded they are, said Reece Jones, a political geography professor at the University of Hawai'i-Manoa and who has written about money spent on border security projects and their consequences. On a small scale and with many guards, walls can effectively stop movement, Jones said. But Israel and the United States’ southern borders are significantly different. The Israel-Egypt border fence is about 150 miles. The U.S.-Mexico border is nearly 2,000 miles. Terrain conditions and number of agents needed to monitor the border are not comparable either, Jones said. "Most of the Israeli fence goes through open, arid terrain. Easy to access, easy to build, easy to monitor with agents," Jones said. The U.S.-Mexico border, on the other hand, includes very remote, mountainous terrain and spans the length of four states with cities closely intertwined with Mexico. Trump has said that border has 1 million legal border crossings daily, which experts have told us include people traveling back and forth for school, work and shopping. Investment in high-tech features such as drones, robots and sensors is also crucial for border security, not just fences, added Elisabeth Vallet, who leads a research team on border walls and is Raoul-Dandurand Chair at the University of Quebec at Montreal. Without those features, people may still go undetected or go around through another border. If illegal entries surge at another border point, then the effectiveness of the fence at one border comes into question, Vallet said. "While the numbers show a dramatic decrease in the number of entries, the amount of credit attributed to the fence is an issue of serious debate in Israel," said Yonatan Jakubowicz, director of research and public relations at the Israeli Immigration Policy Center, an NGO in Israel. Some were skeptical about the fence’s effectiveness when the idea was introduced in 2009, but the barrier received wider support after a terrorist attack on the border road in August 2011, Jakubowicz said. He also said that aside from the fence, additional policies have reduced illegal immigration. The number of illegal border crossings decreased drastically "in an extremely short time" after the implementation of an "Anti-Infiltration Law" in mid 2012, Jakubowicz said. Under the law, individuals caught illegally entering Israel could be detained for up to three years, Jakubowicz said. The number of people illegally crossing Israel’s southern border decreased after the law came into effect, even though the fence was not fully completed, he said. "The fact that people continued to arrive even after the total completion of the fence, with fluctuations, proves that a barrier makes illegal migration more difficult, but not impossible," Jakubowicz said. "Personal interviews and close inspection of migrant diaspora news outlets show that the combination of the fence and the immigration policies are to be attributed to these numbers, and not the fence alone." Our ruling Johnson said Israel cut its illegal immigration rate by "99 percent" by constructing a 143-mile fence along its southern border. Israeli government data support Johnson’s statement. However, experts say the fence alone is not responsible for the dramatic decrease in illegal immigration, policies have also deterred illegal border crossings. Border security experts also caution about comparing Israel and the United States’ southern borders -- the U.S.-Mexico border is much longer than the Israel-Egypt border, terrain conditions are different and more agents would be needed to monitor the U.S. border. Johnson’s statement is accurate, but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/36699ef7-c34d-4106-9696-84f6f2f7a4b3	None	Ron Johnson	None	None	None	2017-02-13T11:53:45	2017-02-03	['Israel']
pomt-02532	"If you have a union job, you're making on average $950 a week. If you have a non-union job, you're making $750 a week."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/07/thomas-perez/labor-secretary-thomas-perez-says-union-members-ea/	Do union members really make $200 a week more than people who aren’t in unions? Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez said so during the Feb. 4, 2014, edition of MSNBC’s Morning Joe. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, Perez said, "just came out with their data on union membership. … If you have a union job, you're making on average $950 a week. If you have a non-union job, you're making $750 a week. So collective bargaining is a big part of how this middle class grew in America and it continues to be an important part of who we are as Americans." We located the report Perez was talking about. In this table, BLS summarizes median weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers in 2012 and 2013 by whether they are in a union or not. The table shows that the median weekly earnings for union members in 2013 was $950, compared to $750 for non-union workers. So Perez is basically right, with one exception. He should have referred to median earnings, rather than average earnings. A median takes the exact middle value from a list that’s ordered from biggest to smallest, rather than taking the sum of all earnings and dividing it by the number of people. The two calculations usually aren’t the same; a median is less likely to be skewed by very small or very large values. Meanwhile, it’s worth pointing out a few other bits of context, none of which make Perez’s claim less accurate. • This is an overall median; the ratios by occupation differ. In some sectors, being a union member doesn’t matter much, BLS found. In several sectors -- including "management, professional, and related occupations," "financial activities," "professional and technical services," "sales and related occupations," "mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction," and the federal government -- non-union workers actually earn modestly more than union members do. And union members earn only marginally more than non-union workers in such fields as "telecommunications" and "arts, entertainment, and recreation." By contrast, the biggest gaps come in fields such as "protective service occupations" (a difference of $459 a week) and "construction" (a difference of $383 a week). Protective service occupations includes correctional officers, police, firefighters, animal control workers, lifeguards, and security guards. "Unions do more to raise the wages of workers with less-than-average education than they do to boost the wages of those with better-than-average education," said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. "Unionized Ph.D.s do not gain as much from being in a union as high school dropouts, though even unionized Ph.D.s may enjoy a bit better job security and receive bigger helpings of health and retirement benefits than their non-union counterparts." • If you include fringe benefits, the difference between union members and non-union workers grows. According to BLS data from 2011, workers’ pay plus benefts for a 40-hour week was $1,508 for a union employee and $1,083 for a non-union worker. That’s a gap of $425 -- more than double the gap in the figures cited by Perez. "Unions are typically more successful in getting good fringe benefits – especially health benefits, sickness pay, and retirement benefits – than in raising workers’ money wages," Burtless said. Our ruling Perez said. "If you have a union job, you're making on average $950 a week. If you have a non-union job, you're making $750 a week." His figures are correct, but with an asterisk -- Perez should have specified "median" when he said "average." In general, though, his overall point is backed up by the data.

So he talks about how troubled the rural schools are. But he sometimes overstates the case. In this single sentence, Edwards makes three distinct claims about the state of affairs in rural education. On accuracy, he goes two for three. First, consider dropout rates. Yes, rural schools have a high rate, 11 percent, as the June 2007 report by the National Center for Education Statistics shows. Just not the highest. The dropout rate in urban areas is worse: 13 percent. But Edwards is right when he says that rural schools have the lowest college enrollment rates in the country. Only 27 percent of students coming from rural schools enrolled in college in 2004-05, according to the report, well below the 37 percent rate in cities and suburbs, and lower than the 32 percent in towns. And he also has it right on teacher pay. The federal report is pretty clear: "Public school teachers in rural areas earned, on average, lower salaries in 2003-04 than their peers in towns, suburbs and cities."

pomt-13714	"Illegal immigration and the crime rate are as low as they’ve been in decades."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/28/barack-obama/crime-and-illegal-immigration-are-decades-long-low/	In his keynote speech on the third night of the Democratic convention, President Barack Obama devoted time to attacking Republican nominee Donald Trump, saying that the candidate promising to "Make America Great Again" is living in a country that is already great. "Ronald Reagan called America 'a shining city on a hill,' " Obama said. "Donald Trump calls it 'a divided crime scene' that only he can fix. It doesn’t matter to him that illegal immigration and the crime rate are as low as they’ve been in decades, because he’s not offering any real solutions to those issues. He’s just offering slogans, and he’s offering fear. He’s betting that if he scares enough people, he might score just enough votes to win this election." Trump did, in fact, call the United States "a divided crime scene" in a tweet. But for this fact-check, we're going to focus on Obama's claim about illegal immigration and crime. Immigration rates There is no reliable count of illegal immigration. Obviously, people coming into the United States illegally are trying to avoid detection. The best indicator available is the number of people apprehended by the U.S. Border Patrol, an imperfect metric because some people can be double-counted if they are apprehended twice, for example. Those data show a mostly steady decline to 337,117 apprehensions in the 2015 fiscal year. In contrast, apprehensions peaked in 2000, when more than 1.6 million were logged. To see a lower nationwide apprehension rate you would have to go back 44 years, to 1971. (The vast majority of those apprehensions in 2015 — 98 percent — were along the southwest border.) Another important caveat to note is that rates don't necessarily equate to enforcement, which has gotten stricter in recent years. Also, the number of people attempting to cross is tied to economic conditions, which aren't always under control of a president. Crime rates Contrary to what Trump has repeatedly contended, the crime rate in the United States has been on the decline for years. There's been some preliminary data from early 2015 and partial comparisons as late as early 2016 indicating an uptick, but the overall trend through 2014 from annual data compiled by the FBI — using reports submitted by local law enforcement agencies — show that violent crime has been falling steadily since the early 1990s. The trend for property crime is similar. In addition, annual statistics collected by the Justice Department for the National Crime Victimization Survey shows the same trends. Our ruling Obama said, "Illegal immigration and the crime rate are as low as they’ve been in decades." The data generally support his claim, but the numbers aren't perfect. There's a hint of a recent uptick in crime based on partial and preliminary data from 2015 and 2016, and estimates of illegal immigration have to rely on border patrol apprehensions because it's impossible to directly count the number of people sneaking into the United States. With those words of caution in mind, we rate Obama's claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7b8d1f60-5715-4cd5-9bf2-999919183a31	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2016-07-28T01:08:40	2016-07-27	['None']

pomt-03514	Says that in Texas, Republican nominees "get 40 percent of the Latino vote on average."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/jun/04/karl-rove/karl-rove-says-republicans-running-texas-draw-40-p/	Republican consultant Karl Rove thinks Georgia Republicans need to stump more like their Texas counterparts. In a May 18, 2013, speech at Georgia’s GOP state convention, Rove said Republicans have "got to get outside of our comfort zone and go places Republicans are not comfortable going," according to a transcript provided to us by Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter Daniel Malloy. "And we’ve got to get candidates who represent the diversity of our country," Rove said. "Look, in Texas we get 40 percent of the Latino vote on average," Rove said. "And that’s because every Republican is comfortable campaigning everywhere in Texas and because we go out of our way to recruit qualified Latino candidates and run them for office." Nationally in 2012, Barack Obama defeated Republican nominee Mitt Romney while enjoying substantial Latino support. Some 71 percent of Hispanic voters favored Obama, compared to 27 percent for Romney, according to voter exit polls undertaken for a consortium of news organizations. A Nov. 9, 2012, CNN news article quoted Republican strategist Ana Navarro, formerly a national Hispanic co-chair of Sen. John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign, as saying: "If we don't do better with Hispanics, we'll be out of the White House forever." We wondered about Rove’s 40-percent-in-Texas claim. Rove, best known for guiding George W. Bush to two wins for governor of Texas and two more for president, declined to elaborate. Polling in 2012 Meantime, we noticed Texas Gov. Rick Perry earlier airing a similar claim, telling Politico for a Nov. 30, 2012, news article that about 40 percent of his state’s Hispanic voters had supported Bush for president and "me when I ran" for re-election as governor "in 2010." Also, Mike Baselice, an Austin pollster who has counseled Perry and numerous Republican candidates, said in an October 2012 memo based on his firm’s Oct. 10-14, 2012, survey of 851 likely Texas voters that at that time, Obama had the support of 49 percent of the state’s Hispanic voters, with Romney at 40 percent. According to Baselice’s memo, Republican U.S. Senate nominee Ted Cruz was supported by 36 percent of Hispanic voters, while Democrat Paul Sadler had 40 percent. The Politico story also mentioned a Texas poll taken on the eve of the 2012 elections indicating Cruz had 35 percent of the state’s Hispanic vote, outpacing Romney, who had 29 percent. The poll by Latino Decisions, a Seattle-based firm that specializes in Latino political opinion research, was based on 400 telephone interviews with Texas Latinos who had voted or were certain to vote. Its margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points suggests that Cruz, but not Romney, was on the verge of drawing 40 percent of the Latino vote. We also talked to Steve Munisteri, chairman of the Republican Party of Texas, who said by phone that in December 2012, Wilson Perkins Allen Research polled 600 Latino Texas voters who participated in the 2012 elections. According to that research, conducted for the party and Republican officeholders, the party’s candidates at the top of the ticket drew more than 40 percent of the state’s Hispanic vote, Munisteri said, with statewide hopefuls farther down the ballot drawing about 35 percent. James Henson, director of the Politics Project in the Department of Government at the University of Texas, struck a cautionary note as we explored Rove’s claim. Any look at how Latino voters divide relies on extrapolation, Henson reminded by email, "since there is no direct measure for Latino voting." Besides, polls can be flawed, Democratic consultant James Aldrete of Austin said by telephone, sometimes under-sampling Hispanic voters or failing to query voters who wish to be interviewed in Spanish. Sylvia Manzano of Houston, an analyst for Latino Decisions, said by telephone that most polls of Texas Latinos fall short of achieving representative samples by concentrating, she said, on pockets of the state. She pointed out an October 2012 Latino Decisions blog post covering polling weaknesses in surveys taken before the 2012 elections. Manzano said she would take Rove’s 40 percent claim with a grain of salt, though she also said "Latinos in Texas have not been averse to voting for Republicans" partly because the state’s Republican Party has not been hostile. Texas polls since 2000 Kind of like stacking grains of salt, we focused on Texas Latino voters by reviewing more than a dozen poll results, covering seven elections from 2000 through 2012, as posted publicly or described to us by pollsters or partisans (see summary table below). Upshot: The best a Republican fared with Texas Hispanics in the elections was U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison when she drew half the Hispanic vote in 2000, by one analysis. The same year, Bush got 49 percent in his first run for president, according to that year’s exit polls taken for news organizations, or 33 percent, according to a poll by the William C. Velásquez Institute. Bush also drew 49 percent in 2004, according to the national exit poll. Joe Lenski, an executive with Edison Research, which oversaw the exit polling, told us by phone the margin of error on Bush’s share of the Latino vote in his home state was plus or minus seven percentage points. By our look, the worst any Republican fared among Texas Hispanics was Romney’s election-eve 29 percent, according to the Latino Decisions poll. We set aside as an outlier Perry’s 31 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2006, considering Perry faced three major November foes, a Democrat and two independents.The same year in a more conventional race, Hutchison drew 44 percent of the Latino vote, according to that year’s exit poll. Considering every result except the one for Perry in 2006 delivers an average of 39 percent of the Hispanic vote for Republicans at or near the top of the tickets. We also averaged the poll showings for each election year, reaching an across-the-years average of 40 percent. Trying another tack, we counted only the polled results for non-presidential candidates, also landing at 40 percent. Three border counties Next, we looked at how Republicans running statewide fared in 2010 and 2012 in traditionally Democratic and Latino-rich Cameron, Hidalgo and El Paso counties, which are on the Texas-Mexico border Drawing on results posted online by the state, we found that in 2010, Attorney General Greg Abbott outpaced nine other GOP statewide winners, drawing 38 percent of the vote in Hidalgo County; 42 percent in El Paso County; and 48 percent in Cameron County. All the candidates together averaged 42 percent of the vote in Cameron County, 39 percent in El Paso County and 33 percent in Hidalgo County. Aside from the presidential race, the 2012 Texas ballot had four statewide races pitting Republicans against Democrats. Cruz topped other GOP victors with 36 percent of El Paso County’s vote. Counting Romney, the GOP nominees carried an average of 27 percent of El Paso County’s vote; 28 percent in Hidalgo County; and 32 percent in Cameron County. Wider views Broadly, Aldrete suggested that since Republican divisions over immigration policy stirred many Latinos starting in 2006, Texas Republicans have experienced slippage among Hispanic voters, like Republicans nationally, he said. So we checked the average result across the available polls for Texas Republicans from 2008 through 2012: 37 percent. By telephone, Baselice offered his historical perspective, saying that in 1982, in an era when Democrats usually won statewide elections, Texas Republicans seeking statewide office drew 12.5 percent of the Hispanic vote. Their share of the Hispanic vote in 1992 was 25 percent, Baselice said, and he then advised Rove that Bush would need 30 percent of the Hispanic vote to defeat Democratic Gov. Ann Richards in 1994. Fast forward: In 2002, Baselice said, Perry carried 35 percent of the Hispanic vote in his first win for governor, and in 2010, he said, Perry got 36 percent of the Hispanic vote. The news organizations’ exit poll that November found Perry getting 38 percent of the Hispanic vote. The same year, Baselice said, David Dewhurst, the Republican re-elected lieutenant governor, drew 40 percent of the Hispanic vote while carrying 62 percent of the total vote. "You don’t get to the mid-60s" in overall percentage, Baselice said, "without getting a significant chunk of the Hispanic vote." By email, New York pollster Micheline Blum, whose clients have included newspapers including the Austin American-Statesman, said by email: "While the majority of Latinos vote for Democrats in Texas as in other states, the Republican candidates for president and for governor have been averaging approximately 40" percent of the Texas Latino vote. "Candidates cannot afford to ignore the Latino vote in Texas—and they don’t," Blum wrote. "Also, Texas is more conservative than the country as a whole and Latino voters in Texas are a bit more conservative than in the country overall as well." Our ruling Rove said Republican candidates in Texas draw 40 percent of the Hispanic vote on average. That claim holds up if you consider the limited array of public polls going back back to 2000, though polls taken in connection with the latest elections suggest not every Republican draws 40 percent. Perhaps there has been slippage since the immigration debate roiled anew and Bush stopped appearing on the ballot. We rate the statement as Mostly True.

pomt-10079	The accuracy of the Obama tax calculator	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/dec/03/barack-obama/accurate-for-some-not-so-much-for-others/	(Published Oct. 22, 2008) Barack Obama has been making a case that his tax plan gives most voters a better deal than John McCain's tax plan. His campaign recently unveiled an online tax calculator so voters can see how they fare under his plan versus McCain's. We decided to take the calculator for a spin to test its accuracy. Keep in mind: Taxes are complicated . Here are a few things that can change your tax bill: how much money you make, whether you're married or single, whether you make your money through a job or through investments, and whether you claim deductions for children, mortgage interest, business expenses or education. So it's not easy to generalize how the candidates' tax plans will affect a particular individual. You can read the Obama and McCain tax plans at their Web sites, and the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center has also posted a comprehensive analysis of both candidates' plans . Before we examine the calculator, we'll make a few general statements about the candidates' tax plans. • If you have income of more than $200,000 as a single person or $250,000 as a married couple, you will pay lower taxes under McCain's plan, potentially much lower. McCain intends to keep the Bush tax cuts in place for higher incomes, while Obama wants to roll them back to Clinton administration levels. The more money you make, the bigger hit you're going to take. For example, let's look at a single millionaire with no kids. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, for example, found that the millionaire's taxes would go up $38,200 under Obama's plan but stay the same under the McCain plan. If our millionaire makes $2-million, the taxes go up $107,024 under Obama's plan but still stay the same under the McCain plan. • Obama's tax credits represent a tax cut to most workers who make less than $200,000. Obama's plan offers a $500 tax credit to people who work as a way of offsetting payroll taxes. This is the policy proposal that allows Obama to make accurate statements such as that he gives 95 percent of workers a tax cut. The credit is refundable, which means that if you don't owe any taxes you will get a check from the government. Republicans have recently called this aspect of Obama's plan welfare, an attack we checked out here . In practice, though, Obama's plan means many people with incomes less than $200,000 will see reduced taxes or bigger refunds under his plan. The tax credits do phase out, however, and people who make around $150,000 may get only a partial credit or none. • McCain offers increased tax deductions for children. McCain's plan proposes to increase the child (or dependent) deduction, gradually doubling it from $3,500 to $7,000. For families making less than $50,000, it doubles in 2009. For everyone else, it gradually increases by $500 a year, doubling around 2016. But the deductions are not refundable, so if your taxes are already at zero, you don't get an additional benefit. Now, let's look at the Obama tax calculator and evaluate its accuracy. We ran a number of scenarios through the calculator, which allows you to select an income range and plug in other factors that would be affected by Obama's plan. We also asked Bob Williams of the Tax Policy Center to check it out for us. Generally speaking, if you accept its methodology and premises, the Obama tax calculator appears mostly accurate. That is, it does not significantly distort either candidate's tax plans. The Obama tax calculator has a lengthy " frequently asked questions " list that spells out its assumptions. But it does present Obama's tax policies in their best light, and it makes a few assumptions that may not be true for all taxpayers. "It gets reasonable answers and is not really wrong," said Williams, the Tax Policy Center's principal research associate. "That said, it is simplistic. It allows only broad ranges of income, which results in only approximate answers. Some people with income in the given ranges would get larger cuts while others would get less." Here's some of the fine print on the Obama calculator. • It's misleading for higher incomes. If you have a higher income, the Obama tax calculator won't tell you how much of a tax increase you'll get. For example, tell the Obama tax calculator that you make more than $250,000, and the calculator says only, "You will probably not get a tax cut under the Obama-Biden plan." Probably not? Make that just about definitely. In some cases, the calculator tells people at higher incomes they save zero dollars but might be eligible for tax credits for retirement. Again, that's highly unlikely. In fact, people with incomes above $250,000 will get tax increases under the Obama plan. • McCain's exemption for children increases over time. The tax calulator computes taxes for 2009, so the calculator does not show the full effect of McCain's proposals to increase the child exemption. McCain proposes to increase this deduction from $3,500 to $7,000, and that kicks in immediately for families that make less than $50,000. But for families who make more than that, it will increase every year through 2016. The Obama calculator does not reflect the benefits in later years to families who make more than $50,000. • Obama's calculator assumes both members of marrie d couples work outside the home. If you enter an income for a married couple that makes less $150,000, the tax calculator always says that you will get a $1,000 tax cut under the Obama plan. But this is true only if both members of the couple work and qualify for Obama's $500 tax credit to offset payroll taxes. If only one person works outside the home, it's only a $500 tax cut. Research indicates that about 70 percent of couples are dual earners, so the calculator is correct for the majority of couples. But for the 30 percent who aren't, the calculator overestimates tax savings under the Obama plan. But you would get a correct answer if you used the "head of household" option. • No analysis of health care plans or business taxes. Obama's tax calculator does not attempt to account for either candidate's health care policies. "Both proposals would have a major impact on who is covered by health care, what type of coverage they receive, and the cost of that coverage as well," states the Obama Web site. "As a result, it is beyond the scope of this calculator to model those complex interactions." Arguably true, but be aware that this is the case. The Obama campaign does not claim that its health care plan would directly lower a person's taxes — rather, you would save money through overall lower health care costs. The McCain health care plan could lower your tax burden slightly, but his health plan is set up so that a refundable health tax credit would go to a special health savings account. In other words, it's not the same as a cash refund. For more on McCain's health plan, read our coverage here . McCain also proposes a corporate tax cut, which can have an indirect effect on individuals, mostly reflected in very small increases to stock-based savings plans like 401(k)s. The models created by the Tax Policy Center account for this effect; the Obama tax calculator does not. • Calculator uses best-case scenarios that have yet to be enacted into law. We really can't say this enough: The candidates' tax proposals are their best-case scenarios, and they could change a great deal if enacted into law. The candidates' plans in some cases lack details that could affect individual taxpayers significantly. Under the Obama tax plan, for example, many benefits phase out as incomes rise. The Obama campaign has yet to spell out the details that would have to be part of a legislative package. Finally, every president has to negotiate its tax plans with Congress, which often demands significant changes. • A better calculator exists, but you might have to dig out last year's tax return to try it . Williams of the Tax Policy Center recommends a Web site called Election Taxes , which was created by Jeff Gramlich, a professor of accounting at the University of Southern Maine. For increased accuracy, it includes many of the categories on actual tax forms. If you're like us, you'll have to pull out last year's returns to remember how much how much you spend annually on child care or how much you claim from itemized deductions. And so we come full circle: Many factors can determine whether your taxes go up or down. “There’s a good reason why 60 percent of us go to a paid preparer to do our taxes," Williams agreed. "People often don’t understand their own taxes because the rules get so complicated." The Obama tax calculator doesn't falsify information or make things up. But it's not entirely accurate, either, especially when it comes to tax increases for higher incomes. It's not accurate to say higher incomes don't get a tax cut when actually they get a tax increase. A calculator suggests a well-calibrated instrument that displays an objective answer, and we can't say that about the Obama campaign's device. So we issue a "Buyer Beware" and rate the Obama tax calculator Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-12-03T00:00:00	2008-10-14	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-12200	"When the price for oil goes up on the markets, it goes right up, but it never goes down."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/25/charles-schumer/yes-chuck-schumer-oil-prices-do-fall/	What goes up must come down, the old saying goes. But, according to Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., that’s not the case for oil prices. As part of a round of appearances to tout a new Democratic economic-policy agenda, Schumer took a moment on ABC’s This Week to promote his party’s plan to curb mergers that aren’t in the interest of consumers. "We're going to change the way companies can merge," Schumer said. "We have these huge companies buying up other big companies. It hurts workers and it hurts prices. The old Adam Smith idea of competition, it's gone. So people hate it when their cable bills go up, their airline fees. They know that gas prices are sticky. You know … when the price for oil goes up on the markets, it goes right up, but it never goes down." However, this broad statement clashes with the long-term data for gasoline and crude oil prices. There are long stretches over the past four decades when inflation-adjusted gasoline prices have gone down. Here’s a chart from the Energy Information Administration, a federal office that tracks energy statistics. And here’s the inflation-adjusted data for imported crude oil. The pattern is similar. Clearly, gasoline and crude oil prices aren’t simply on an eternal escalator to infinity, as one might think hearing Schumer. So what’s going on? When we checked with Schumer’s office, they said he was referring to the "rise like a rocket, fall like a feather" theory of gas prices. Under this theory, gasoline prices tend to go up quickly if there’s a market shock, then fall more slowly after supply and demand resolve themselves. Schumer sees that pattern as one example of how big companies can sometimes have too much power to control prices, regardless of market forces. But when we ran Schumer’s statement by Severin Borenstein, a University of California-Berkeley economist who wrote a seminal paper on the rocket-feather theory in 1997, he said the senator’s formulation is off-base. He said that while it is true that retail gasoline prices decline more slowly than they rise, the time frame for these changes is fairly short -- two weeks to go up, and six weeks or more to go down. Schumer’s statement suggests an iron rule, not a pattern for short-term changes following a market shock. "You don't have to be an economist or analyst of oil markets to know that the statement isn't correct," Borenstein told PolitiFact. "Obviously, gasoline prices do go down when oil prices decline. The change in gasoline prices since the 2014 collapse in oil prices made that very clear." Meanwhile, Denton Cinquegrana, chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service, a private firm, said that Schumer’s targets -- monopoly-minded companies -- aren’t necessarily to blame. He pointed to a study of 420 gas stations in San Diego in 2000 and 2001 that looked at the psychology and behavior of consumers. If a consumer sees a relatively low price, the study found, they won’t bother searching aggressively for a price that’s lower still, even though such bargains may exist around the corner. When such behavior is multiplied across many drivers, gas stations feel less pressure to reduce prices further than they already have, slowing the fall of gas prices. And economist Philip K. Verleger, who runs the firm PKVerleger LLC, said Schumer may also have an outdated view of how the oil markets work. "There’s a more competitive market today -- the futures market runs everything now," he said. "The futures can predict your local gas prices, and the response is more symmetric (before and after a market shock) than it was." Our ruling Schumer said, "When the price for oil goes up on the markets, it goes right up, but it never goes down." This comment takes a well-known phenomenon and exaggerates it beyond recognition. While experts agree that prices tend to go up quickly after a market shock but usually come down more slowly once the shock is resolved, this phenomenon only occurs on a short-term basis -- a couple of weeks in most cases. Long-term data show long stretches since the mid 1970s when the inflation-adjusted price of gasoline and crude oil have fallen. We rate the statement False.

pomt-14441	On ending stop and frisk	half flip	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/mar/08/jim-kenney/jim-kenney-and-stop-and-frisk-did-rookie-philly-ma/	Did Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney really promise to bring an end to stop-and-frisk? Based on a recent interview with Al Dia’s editorial board, not totally. "I never said stop-and-frisk was going to end entirely," Kenney told Al Dia staffers last week. "What we are going to stop is the random stopping of people, Latinos and African Americans, on the street and the cop asking, 'What are you doing here?' " Kenney provided them with the following explanation: "If you get held up on the street by a guy with a Flyers hat, and you call in 911 and you say, 'A guy with a Flyers hat just held me up at gun point.' And three minutes later the police see a guy in the neighborhood with a Flyers hat, he is going to get stopped," he said, "And since you told them he has a gun, they are going to frisk him. So the issue for us is those frisks are ... constitutional and legitimate based on a call on 911 from a citizen." It’s worth noting that Kenney is making a legal distinction here. If we’re talking about stop-and-frisk as a policy that disproportionately targets black and Hispanic men with little basis for the stops, then that’s one thing. But, "a frisk that is based on reasonable suspicion that the person has a weapon is constitutional," Mary Catherine Roper, deputy legal director of the ACLU of Pennsylvania, wrote in an email. She cautioned that a reasonable search "might a (call for) more than a Flyers hat on game day," but added, "Mayor Kenney is certainly describing a process that is permitted under the law." Police Commissioner Richard Ross told the Philadelphia Inquirer in February that eliminating stop-and-frisk isn’t altogether possible. "At the risk of sounding flip, there's no city that has the authority to end stop-and-frisk," said Ross. "The best you could do as a city is decide you want to have a precipitous drop - the only danger in that is, it's kind of a reverse quota, it suggests you had to have (a quota) in the first place." In his campaign materials, Team Kenney did note that he would "not permit the continued prevalence of impermissible stops-and-frisks," and that he would create a new reasonable suspicion training program so that police would better grasp the difference. Kenney didn’t always delineate these practices with care on the campaign trail, however. Kenney stated he would straight-up end stop-and-frisk, no ifs, no caveats, and he did so repeatedly. ""If (I'm) mayor, stop-and-frisk will end in Philadelphia, no question," Kenney told Newsworks last April. "(I) would like to work with Commissioner Ramsey as well as the FOP to find a responsible way to bring that practice to an end." After his primary win, he doubled down, "If you have a program that divides the community from the police and it doesn’t result in anything positive going forward," Kenney told press, as reported by CBS Local. "It should be stopped … I’m going to tell (then-Commissioner Ramsey) that in the end, it doesn’t make police officers safer, it doesn’t make citizens safer." Several outlets, including Billy Penn, have noted the discrepancy between popular campaign statements and his actual goals as mayor. At Ross’ January swearing-in, Kenney summed up the knottiness of the stop-and-frisk himself, describing it as "unfortunate terminology used as a crime fighting tool." Our ruling The legal considerations for quelling a policy like stop-and-frisk weren’t lost on Kenney during the campaign. His written campaign materials appear consistent with his stance now.

pomt-06445	The newly created state Immigration Enforcement Review Board "can actually prosecute, and get them [violators] into jail, if we bring in the attorney general."	false	/georgia/statements/2011/oct/21/phil-kent/kent-immigration-board-can-prosecute-attorney-gene/	Critics of conservative activist Phil Kent have accused him of being a "nativist." Now that Gov. Nathan Deal has appointed Kent to a new board to crack down on illegal immigration, critics say he’s distorting the truth. They point to a speech Kent made before the North Fulton and Friends Tea Party on Oct. 4 where he explained the authority of the Immigration Enforcement Review Board. The state General Assembly created it when lawmakers passed House Bill 87, legislation that aims to get tough on illegal immigration. Kent’s appointment to the board created controversy. The Anti-Defamation League asked Deal to reconsider Kent's appointment, saying he has a history of making "deeply disturbing" comments about immigrants. Kent said his critics are left-wing extremists pushing their own agenda. Kent told the tea party group that all the review board does is take complaints about possible violations of state laws on immigration. The board can subpoena witnesses, hold hearings and review or investigate possible violators. "And yes we can actually prosecute, and get them into jail, if we bring in the attorney general," Kent said. "That’s what the open borders, anti-enforcement people don’t like." Immigrant rights activist Erik Voss, who videotaped the speech, cried foul. The review board has no authority to bring in the attorney general, much less prosecute or jail violators, he told PolitiFact Georgia. We thought Kent’s statement was worth a closer look. Can the immigration board call in the attorney general’s office and prosecute? We looked into the law. The Immigration Enforcement Review Board was created by Section 20 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Enforcement Act of 2011, also known as House Bill 87. The seven-member review board fields complaints that Georgia governments or agencies have violated any of three state laws. One bans them from establishing policies that give illegal immigrants safe harbor. A second requires them to check the legal status of applicants for public benefits such as food stamps. The third mandates that their contractors and subcontractors file affidavits saying they use a federal database that checks whether employees are in the U.S. legally. Some of the violations the board has the authority to investigate can be considered criminal offenses. Agency workers who purposefully violate the law requiring them to check the legal status of those seeking public benefits commit a misdemeanor, and the attorney general has the authority to investigate. Those who knowingly file false affidavits about their use of the federal database violate felony fraud laws. Local governments that give safe harbor or sanctuary to illegal immigrants risk losing state funding. The board can issue sanctions such as fines as high as $5,000 if a local government doesn’t fix its problems by deadline. The section of HB 87 that established the immigration board makes no mention of bringing in or collaborating with the attorney general’s office, except to say that the law does not prohibit the state’s top lawyer from "seeking any other remedy available by law." We asked the state attorney general’s office for its understanding of the law. A spokeswoman said that the immigration board has civil enforcement authority, while the attorney general has the power to prosecute violators criminally. The immigration board can make recommendations to the attorney general’s office, which will decide whether criminal prosecution is appropriate. The Association County Commissioners of Georgia and the Georgia Municipal Association, interest groups that represent local and county governments, have the same understanding of the immigration board’s powers. Kent told us that’s how he understands the law, too. If activists think he’s saying that the board has the power to criminally prosecute violators on its own, they’re twisting his words, said Kent, who is national spokesman for Americans for Immigration Control. "The panel could most certainly, if it felt warranted, ‘bring in the attorney general’ and recommend his office open an investigation with an eye toward prosecution," Kent said in an email. Anyone has the power to tell the attorney general of a possible violation of the law, he told us in a telephone interview. "The board can’t do it alone, obviously," Kent said. We agree, but that’s not what Kent originally said. Kent said that the board "can actually prosecute" violators, and "get them into jail," if it enlists the help of the attorney general’s office. Actually, the board cannot prosecute anyone or get them into jail. The board can bring a potential violation to the attorney general’s attention. So can any citizen. That doesn’t mean his office will investigate, much less prosecute. Kent may have meant to convey that the Immigration Enforcement Review Board can only recommend that the attorney general open an investigation, but he gave the impression it has far more power than that. He therefore earns a False.	None	Phil Kent	None	None	None	2011-10-21T06:00:00	2011-10-04	['None']
pomt-05038	Says "Your kid just ate 16 packs of sugar."	true	/oregon/statements/2012/jul/11/multnomah-county/did-your-kid-just-drink-16-packs-sugar/	In recent days we’ve heard a revival of an age-old question that highlights our nation’s shared love of sugar yet calls out our regional differences: Is it pop or is it soda? Or maybe it’s just Coke? While in bubbly debate over what to call soft drinks -- your PolitiFact Oregon staff does not agree on this -- a colleague of ours suggested a potential fact check that anyone might find intriguing, no matter what they call their carbonated beverage of choice. You’ve probably seen the "Sugar Packs" ads around Multnomah County, put there by the Health Department as part of a healthy living and anti-obesity campaign that started in 2010. It’s the one with a pile of packets of white sugar draining into a 20-ounce bottle of generic cola. "Your kid just ate 16 packs of sugar," the ad states. "All those extra calories can bring on obesity, diabetes and heart disease." Sixteen packets? Our collective stomachs cramped. Our teeth ached. We swallowed our distaste and started checking. Soda-sleuthing turned out to be quite easy, namely because there’s a lot of pop in a newsroom. In fact, we found more than a dozen empties within spitting distance. A 12-ounce can of Coca-Cola regular, we learned, contains 39 grams of sugar, usually from high-fructose corn syrup in the United States. A 20-ounce bottle would then contain 65 grams of sugar. Corn syrup is not the same as white table sugar, but the county is talking equivalents. A packet of table sugar as shown in the ad is equal to about a teaspoon, or about 4 grams of sugar. So, indeed, there are at least 16 packs of sugar in every 20-ounce bottle of regular cola. There’s no arguing that that’s a large chunk of sweet. The American Heart Association recommends no more than nine teaspoons -- nine packets -- of added sugar a day for adult men. For women, it’s six. But just for the fun of it -- no, we’re not on a sugar high -- we wanted to know what else could contain the equivalent of 16 packets of granulated white. And bingo: A 16-ounce Jamba Juice Banana Berry contains 60 grams of sugar. A 12-ounce Chocolate McCafe shake from McDonald’s has 76 grams. A Starbucks Grande non-fat, no-whip Caramel Frappucino Blended Beverage contains 59 grams of sugar, although to be fair, the drink also includes 4 grams of nutritious protein. The iced lemon pound cake contains 46 grams of sugar -- but then, all you adults knew that -- and PolitiFact Oregon has fallen into tangential research. Back to the point. We figure children don’t usually indulge in diet sodas, which are made with artificial sweeteners like aspartame, and not with corn syrup or sugar. We’re told by a beverage trade publication that 12-ounce cans are the top sellers -- but a 20-ounce bottle doesn’t seem out of line in this age of super-sized drinks and Double Big Gulps. "It’s what’s available in our environment," said Sonia Manhas, who manages the program for the county. After all, McDonald’s markets a 16-ounce soda as a small-sized soft drink and a 12-ounce drink as child-sized. We figure parents are smart enough to figure out the sugar-gram-to-cola-ounce ratio themselves. The smaller the drink, the fewer the sugar packets. All this really means is that we find the county’s statement accurate. We rate it True. And that’s the unsugar-coated truth.

pomt-08000	Virginia ranked 35th in job creation in 2009 under Gov. Tim Kaine, and moved up to third for 2010, while McDonnell has been in office.	half-true	/virginia/statements/2011/jan/14/bob-mcdonnell/gov-bob-mcdonnell-says-his-job-creation-record-top/	Gov. Bob McDonnell has made job creation a priority--and key talking point--since he took office a year ago. In his inaugural address he said "the creation of new job opportunities for all our citizens is the obligation of our time." McDonnell returned to that theme Jan. 12 in his annual State of the Commonwealth speech. "Since February 2010, Virginia has added 67,900 net new jobs, the third-highest number in the nation. We ranked 35th in this same category in 2009." We sensed some unspoken political score settling within the statement. After all, Democrat Tim Kaine was governor in 2009. And McDonnell, a Republican, was governor for all but the first two weeks of 2010. We wondered about two things: Are those rankings correct, and do they provide an accurate picture of Virginia’s job growth compared to the rest of the nation? Stacey Johnson, McDonnell’s press secretary, told us the figures were taken from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, which gathers the nation’s job and unemployment information. According BLS, Virginia lost 94,600 jobs during 2009, the 35th best performance of any state. But how relevant are net job figures, when each state has a different population? Should we be using a percentage-based figure instead, to account for the different populations in the various states? After all, as Harvard economist Jeffrey Miron told us, "1,000 jobs in Idaho are much more important than 1,000 jobs in New York." Virginia is a relatively large state, ranking 12th in population. During 2009 the largest job losses occurred in the largest states, with California leading the way. If we examine the figures on a percentage basis, the state’s performance suddenly looks better. Those 94,600 jobs represented 2.56 percent of the state’s employed population. That 2.56 percent drop in jobs places Virginia’s performance 14th best nationally. The state added 67,900 net new jobs between February 2010 and November 2010, the last month for which data are available. That matches the governor’s claim, and McDonnell is right that Virginia’s job creation trailed only the 196,400 jobs new jobs in Texas and the 70,000 jobs added in Pennsylvania during the period. When looking at the 2010 figures on a percentage basis, Virginia’s statewide employment rolls grew 1.90 percent between February and November. That’s good for fifth in the nation, trailing only Washington D.C., Maryland, North Dakota and Texas. John Knapp, a senior economist at the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at The University of Virginia, explained why the percentage figures are a more accurate reflection of performance. "For comparisons among the states we use percentages because of the tremendous difference in size," he said. "The total number is relevant if you are doing a comparison inside the state." Let’s look at two examples. Nevada lost 76,800 jobs during 2009, meaning by McDonnell’s math it performed better--and should rank higher--than Virginia. But because Nevada has far fewer people than the Commonwealth, those lost jobs represented 6.40 percent of the Silver State’s work force. So didn’t Virginia easily out out perform Nevada? Or consider New York’s 2009 performance. The state lost 208,700 jobs, 2.41 percent of the total. Despite having a far greater net job loss, New York’s performance was actually a bit better than Virginia’s when we account for population differences. Randy Marcus, chief of staff for Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, compiles the employment figures used by McDonnell administration. He said raw and percentage figures provide equally accurate views of the job picture. Marcus said the figure used by McDonnell was one of many statistics available to show Virginia’s performance and also argued that to people looking for work,,total job creation numbers are far more important than percentage figures or state-to-state comparisons. Knapp has previously told ushe thinks governors get undue kudos for good job numbers and undue scorn when jobs leave a state. Miron has similar views. "I, like most economists, feel consistently that politicians get too much blame and too much credit," he said. "They are not irrelevant, but in a state economy the national economy obviously matters." Miron did say governors and state legislatures sometimes have a short-term impact, citing the recent move by politicians in Illinois to raise personal and business income tax rates. Let’s review. McDonnell has used raw numbers to draw the starkest contrast with Kaine. Under that set of numbers, which measure total jobs gained or lost each year, the governor accurately said Virginia ranked 35th under Kaine and third under the McDonnell administration. But percentages tell a more complete story. Based on percentage of the work force, Virginia's job creation went from being 14th under Kaine to fifth under McDonnell, which is not nearly as dramatic. McDonnell has used a selective set of data to imply Virginia went from being a "D" student under Kaine to an "A" student under the new administration. But that fails to provide the necessary context provided by percentages. In reality Virginia went from a "B+" performance under Kaine to an "A" performance under McDonnell. Therefore, we find McDonnell’s claim Half True.	None	Bob McDonnell	None	None	None	2011-01-14T19:43:08	2011-01-12	['Virginia']
pomt-07375	Says he has exposed plans by Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker to push legislation that would allow the state to declare financial martial law and take over municipal governments.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/may/05/ed-garvey/democrat-and-activist-ed-garvey-says-wisconsin-gov/	Wisconsin isn’t the only state stirring national political headlines. In Michigan, a new law allows the governor to take over local governments deemed to be in financial trouble. Benton Harbor is one of several Michigan municipalities that failed a financial "stress test" and is now under the control of a state-appointed manager who, among other things, has the power to scrap contracts with public employee unions. Local elected officials are no longer in control. Protests are mounting over what critics have called a "dictatorship" and at least once lawsuit claims the measure gives the state "czar-like" powers. Could financial "martial law" declarations be coming to Wisconsin? According to long-time Democratic activist Ed Garvey, such steps are next on the agenda of Republican Gov. Scott Walker. He first raised the issue April 14, 2011 on his Fightingbob.com blog, then repeated it in subsequent postings, on Wisconsin Public Radio and in an interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin. Rick Ungar, a blogger on Forbes.com, picked up Garvey’s assertions April 16 with a posting entitled "Gov. Scott Walker Reportedly Planning Financial Martial Law in Wisconsin." Two days later, during an April 18 radio interview, Walker vehemently denied being involved with any such plan. So has Garvey exposed Team Walker’s next controversial political push? Now, we can’t rule on prospective claims -- what will happen in the future. But we can look at what Garvey says he has already done -- expose plans that are under way -- and whether his evidence supports his own claim. Let’s go to Garvey’s original blog post. "We have discovered that Wisconsin's governor has the same twisted idea for Wisconsin as Michigan's governor does of his state," Garvey wrote April 14, 2011 on his blog. "The state would be allowed to take over local governments if financial management standards are not met. Who decides? The governor or a newly elected uber comptroller. (I am not making this up.)" He adds: "The secret plan is being prepared by the state's largest law firm, Foley & Lardner, for the Greater Milwaukee Committee, the Bradley Foundation, the governor, and key legislators." A closer look at the evidence shows it’s not as Machiavellian as Garvey claims. Garvey discovered a recently launched website, Makeityourmilwaukeecounty.com That spells out a legislative initiative. However, it’s hardly a secret. The site is the online version of a project launched by a Greater Milwaukee Committee task force. It’s an outgrowth of a years-long effort by the private business group to study and recommend reforms to Milwaukee County government. The task force’s recommendations drew attention in an Oct. 9, 2010 column by the Journal Sentinel’s Dan Bice, who wrote the recommendations were back-burnered so as not to come out before the November election for governor. In November, PolitiFact Wisconsin looked at a claim by the state Democratic Party that GMC chairman and Walker campaign chairman Michael Grebe killed release of the report before the election. We said the claim was Barely True. In February, the GMC task force made its recommendations public and the website launched about the same time. The report calls for several initiatives, including: "Develop a statewide fiscal stress test through the State Department of Revenue to help local governments maintain fiscal health." So, the site does talk about a "stress test," but that’s not the same as the "martial law" style approach in Michigan. In fact, the website explicitly says the group is opposed to that approach: "The Initiative does not support this type of legislation in Wisconsin." What’s more, according to GMC president Julia Taylor, about half the states have a "fiscal scorecard." The thinking, she said, is that the more the public knows about how their local government is faring, the sooner problems can be headed off. Taylor said she wasn’t sure when a bill including the GMC’s plan would be introduced or by whom. "It’s very, very early in the process," she said. "At this point we don’t have draft language." To be sure, some heavy-hitters are working with the GMC to build support for the recommendations and hammer them into legislation -- including lobbyists with Foley & Lardner, former state legislator Mary Panzer and public relations firm Mueller Communications. And the GMC is chaired by Grebe, who was Walker’s campaign chairman and led the governor’s transition team. Grebe also heads the conservative Bradley Foundation. So, it may be easy to see why Garvey tries to connect some of the dots. What about the essence of Garvey’s claim, that he discovered Walker’s involvement with the plan being discussed -- and, therefore, his support of it? As Milwaukee County executive, Walker expressed support for the GMC efforts. But in the wake of Garvey’s first blog post, he issued a sharp denial about involvement now. "No truth to it whatsoever. Absolutely a bogus story," Walker said April 18, 2011 in an interview with WTMJ-AM (620) talk show host Charlie Sykes. "There's nobody on my staff, nobody in my administration, I'm certainly not working anything remotely close to that." Nevertheless, Garvey said in an interview that he still believes that Walker is involved. "I think that’s true," he said. "It all sort of fits in with a pattern." But thinking something is true and showing it to be true are two different things. Garvey says he discovered a secret plot by Walker to push Michigan-style legislation that would allow the state to test the finances of local governments and then take over the bad apples. The Greater Milwaukee Committee is proposing a "good-government" style website that would allow citizens to compare and contrast the health of local government finances. But it explicitly stops short of a Michigan-style approach. What’s more, Garvey did not uncover it (it was previously announced by the group) and he’s provided no direct evidence of involvement from Walker, who vehemently denies it. The measure could change through the legislative process, but that’s the future. Garvey had a "scoop." But it was more of the gardening -- and not journalistic -- variety. We rate his claim False.

pomt-04961	Says Barack Obama "counted on Sandy Adams" to approve stimulus spending.	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2012/jul/25/john-mica/john-mica-says-obama-counted-gop-rep-sandy-adams-s/	Things get ugly when two sitting lawmakers vie for the same seat. This is certainly the case in the Republican primary battle for Florida’s 7th Congressional District. The Central Florida race features Rep. John Mica, a political veteran with a role in House leadership, and Rep. Sandy Adams, who rode the 2010 tea party wave out of the state Legislature and into Congress. In a scathing mailpiece, Mica claims he is the right person to represent the reorganized 7th Congressional District because Adams is in cahoots with President Barack Obama. The piece states in large type, "Barack Obama counted on Sandy Adams." Some more excerpts: Sandy Adams Voted Twice to Approve $8 Billion in Obama Stimulus Spending. Compare Sandy Adams to John Mica before you vote in the Republican primary. John Mica is the only Republican in this race to vote against Obama stimulus. Wait, what? Didn’t Adams, a tea party favorite endorsed by Sarah Palin, come to Washington in 2011? How could she have supported Obama’s 2009 economic stimulus package? The mailer offers citations, in the form of bill numbers and vote dates, to back up its claims. Such a gesture sometimes gives us hope that truthfulness will be found. Alas, no. Mica’s claim is illogical. The citations are for annual state budgets the Florida Legislature passed in 2009 (SB 2600) and 2010 (HB 5001). Indeed, Adams, then a member of the Florida House, voted for both. Lawmakers faced a tremendous budget shortfall in 2009, and part of the way they offset damaging cuts was to accept $5 billion from the federal stimulus program (and through raising taxes and fees on Floridians by $2.2 billion). The same story emerged in 2010, with $2.4 billion from the stimulus program piped in to patch the deficit. Adams wasn’t the only House Republican to vote for these budgets. The plans sailed through the Legislature along party lines, with Republicans almost unanimously in favor. Democrats who voted against the budget in 2009 called it "inadequate." Adams, who campaigned against government waste like a lot of her GOP contemporaries, referred to the stimulus as a "failed" bill in a 2010 Orlando Sentinel op-ed. Mica’s team says that’s not her real position. "We needed to let voters know that her record does not match the rhetoric," said Mica spokesman Alan Byrd. "Congressman Mica voted no." We have to say, though, we find this line of argument ridiculous. Using Mica’s logic, that means Obama also counted on Gov. Rick Scott, a high-profile basher of Obama’s stimulus and health care reforms. The first budget Scott signed contained millions of stimulus dollars, after all. Plus, Adams’ team said Mica is being hypocritical. They pointed to several instances in which Mica, along with eight other House Republicans, voted "no" on the stimulus and then publicly campaigned for Florida to receive stimulus money for projects such as high-speed rail just hours later. His critique of it then was that it didn’t spend enough money on transportation projects. Our ruling Mica says Obama counted on Adams to approve stimulus spending. That's not the case. Congress approved the stimulus in 2009, before Adams took her seat in 2011. Adams did vote for two state budgets that contained stimulus money, as did many other Florida legislators who opposed the federal law. Likewise, Mica himself lobbied for stimulus projects in Florida once the stimulus became law. Mica's mailer is misleading and hardly offers an apples-to-apples comparison. Adams couldn’t have voted on the stimulus program because she wasn’t even a member of Congress at the time. We rule this statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-07045	Says President Barack Obama’s overturning of the Mexico City Policy means federal tax dollars can be used "to fund abortion all over the world."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/jul/01/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-obamas-repeal-policy-means-tax/	At a Los Angeles anti-abortion rally, Texas Gov. Rick Perry said "folks in Washington" have failed "to protect citizens at every stage in life." In President Barack Obama’s first week in office, Perry said, he "chose to overturn the ‘Mexico City Policy,’ which basically means that your federal tax dollars can now be used to fund abortions all over the world." Perry’s June 12 statement landed in national news stories, including reports by National Public Radio and the Associated Press; readers asked us whether Perry was correct. Back story: Obama rescinded what is known as the Mexico City Policy on his third day as president in January 2009, according to news accounts posted online. The policy, first put in place by President Ronald Reagan, requires foreign nongovernmental groups getting U.S. family planning funds to agree that they will not perform or "actively promote" abortion as a method of family planning outside of the United States, even if using money from other sources. Those family planning grants are distributed through the U.S. Agency for International Development and are used to fund a variety of activities, including distribution of contraceptives and training of health care workers. Groups may also use the funds to provide emergency treatment for women who have been hurt by or become ill from an abortion. The Reagan administration announced the expanded restrictions at the 1984 International Conference on Population in Mexico City (the source of the policy’s name), saying that the United States "does not consider abortion an acceptable element of family planning programs and will no longer contribute to those of which it is a part." Since then, the Mexico City Policy has been in place during Republican administrations and repealed during Democratic ones. According to a 2001 Congressional Research Service report, the policy defined abortion promotion — banned under the Mexico City Policy — as working "to increase the availability or use of abortion as a method of family planning." Prohibited activities included operating a counseling service that includes information on the benefits and availability of abortion, advising someone that abortion is available and lobbying a foreign government to legalize abortion as a method of family planning. The policy allowed for several exceptions. Among them: A group receiving U.S. funds was allowed to perform abortions if a woman’s life was threatened or if a pregnancy was the result of rape or incest. Aid recipients could also continue to treat women who had been injured during legal or illegal abortions So, is Perry correct that the policy’s 2009 removal by Obama means federal tax dollars can fund abortions all over the world? Not so, says Ellen Starbird, deputy director of USAID’s office of population and reproductive health, because regardless of the Mexico City Policy, a 1973 federal law known as the Helms amendment prohibits U.S. foreign aid from paying for abortions as a method of family planning in foreign countries. A 2010 CRS report says that after 1973 but before the Mexico City Policy came to be, no U.S. funds could be used directly to pay for abortion as a method of family planning abroad, though in countries where abortion was legal, foreign NGOs receiving U.S. aid could use other money to perform them. In those cases, the report says, the groups were required to keep "segregated accounts for U.S. money in order to demonstrate compliance with the abortion restrictions." Once the Mexico City Policy was in place, groups that wanted U.S. family planning aid couldn’t provide abortions, regardless of the funding source. Conversely, now that the policy has been lifted, foreign NGOs that perform abortions can receive U.S. family planning aid. Seems straightforward. But as we’ve learned with other abortion-related fact-checks, it’s not. After learning about the funding restrictions in the Helms amendment, we circled back to Perry’s office. Spokeswoman Catherine Frazier stood by Perry’s statement, saying that "if U.S. taxpayer money is going to groups that provide abortions, regardless of any other services they provide, it’s going toward promoting and funding abortions." Likewise, Kellie Fiedorek, a lawyer for Americans United for Life, a pro-life advocacy group, told us that without the policy intact, "Americans’ tax dollars may still go to NGOs that provide abortions." Austin Ruse, president of the Catholic Family and Human Rights Institute, a pro-life think tank, told us that a group’s ability to move its money around is the key to assessing whether Perry’s statement is accurate. "If you believe money is fungible, then what Perry said is true," Ruse said. That concern also has played prominently in debates in Congress and statehouses over providing domestic abortion providers with funding for other services. Proponents of the Mexico City Policy also say that groups newly getting USAID money for family planning can then free up other funds for abortions. USAID spokesman Nicole Schiegg told us that the agency "has a robust compliance system in place to ensure that our funds are not used for prohibited activities." Starbird told us that if a foreign NGO that provides abortions receives U.S. family planning aid, it is required to keep that money separate from its own. The groups are not allowed "free rein" with the funds, she said. Starbird said each award to a foreign NGO is for a specific purpose, and written agreements specify limits such as the Helms’ restriction. She also said recipients are required to account for how the funds are spent, including any money awarded for overhead or indirect costs, and USAID workers monitor the programs. For longer perspective, we asked Barbara Crane, an author of a 2001 article on the Mexico City Policy for Science magazine, about Perry’s statement and the funding issues raised by the policy’s proponents. Crane, a former USAID employee working for Ipas, an international NGO that supports abortion rights, suggested the government takes a chance on money being misspent whenever it makes an award. Crane said, though, that if the government holds groups accountable for delivering the services for which the aid money was awarded, "there is little opportunity for … the organization to divert funds to support current or new activities in other areas." We unsuccessfully sought independent research into how foreign NGOs have spent USAID family-planning money. Separately, Perry’s office offered no evidence of U.S. family planning funds enabling particular NGOs to perform abortions. We also could not determine how many foreign NGOs receive U.S. family planning aid and also perform abortions. Starbird told us that the agency doesn’t ask groups seeking family planning money whether they provide abortions. But Crane, of Ipas, speculated that most don’t engage in abortion-related activities, and many are working in nations that have strict abortion laws. Where does that leave us? With the policy’s repeal, foreign NGOs that perform abortions can receive U.S. family planning money. However, longstanding federal law bars any aid from being spent on abortions, and USAID polices how its family-planning grants are spent. But Perry’s statement retains a sliver of truth in that it’s possible some aid could be misspent or that U.S. aid could free up other money to go toward abortions. We rate the statement Barely True.

pomt-04011	Says "in Katrina, they approved $60 billion within 10 days of the storm on a voice vote."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/feb/06/chris-christie/chris-christie-tells-david-letterman-60-billion-ka/	It took Congress three months to sign off on federal aid for Hurricane Sandy victims, but Gov. Chris Christie said federal officials approved $60 billion in aid within just 10 days of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. And that Katrina aid was authorized without members of Congress even casting roll call votes, according to the Republican governor. In between pulling doughnuts out of his pockets, Christie offered that background during his appearance Monday on the "Late Show with David Letterman." The late-night host questioned whether the delay in securing Sandy aid could have happened at any point. "It didn’t happen eight years ago," Christie told Letterman. "I mean, in Katrina, they approved $60 billion within 10 days of the storm on a voice vote." The governor’s right that about $60 billion in emergency aid was approved in the 10 days after Hurricane Katrina made landfall in Louisiana, but Christie is wrong to claim all of that money was approved "on a voice vote." In a voice vote, members of Congress just shout out "yea" or "nay" without their individual votes being recorded. But contrary to what Christie said, most of that roughly $60 billion was approved by way of recorded votes. The governor’s office did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment. Let’s explain the different sets of votes on the Katrina aid. As we confirmed in a previous fact-check, the Republican-controlled Congress approved two bills providing $62.3 billion in emergency funding in the 10 days after Hurricane Katrina made landfall on Aug. 29, 2005, near Buras, La. On Sept. 2, 2005, Congress passed a bill to provide $10.5 billion in emergency aid related to damage caused by Katrina. The House approved that bill by a voice vote, and the Senate approved the legislation by "unanimous consent." Under unanimous consent, there is no recorded vote and the bill is considered approved if no one objects. But on Sept. 8, 2005, when Congress approved an additional $51.8 billion in emergency appropriations for Katrina victims, both chambers held recorded votes on the legislation. The bill passed in the House by a 410-11 vote and in the Senate by 97-0. Twelve House members and three senators did not cast ballots on the measure. So, although the first bill was approved without any recorded votes, the second bill -- which provided most of the $62.3 billion in funding -- was passed by recorded votes. But just as Christie said, securing federal approval for Sandy aid took much longer. Three months after Hurricane Sandy made landfall near Atlantic City, President Barack Obama signed a bill on Jan. 29 to provide about $50 billion in emergency appropriations. The GOP-controlled House had approved the bill on Jan. 15, and the Democrat-led Senate passed it on Jan. 28. Earlier in January, the president signed a bill providing $9.7 billion for the National Flood Insurance Program to assist Sandy victims. Our ruling During his appearance on the "Late Show with David Letterman," Christie claimed that "in Katrina, they approved $60 billion within 10 days of the storm on a voice vote." But all of that funding was not approved by federal officials shouting "yea" or "nay" on the House and Senate floors. Congress signed off on $10.5 billion in Katrina aid without recorded votes, but the remaining $51.8 billion was approved by recorded votes. Still, the governor’s overall point is solid. While Hurricane Sandy victims waited three months for federal aid to be approved, Congress had authorized $62.3 billion in the 10 days after Hurricane Katrina made landfall in Louisiana.

pomt-12323	Says Kellyanne Conway said liberal women hate her because of her "striking beauty and intellect."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jun/20/londonwebnewscom/kellyanne-conway-did-not-say-liberal-women-hate-he/	The false assertion that White House adviser Kellyanne Conway told an anonymous reporter that liberal women hate her for being smart and beautiful showed up on a website that made it especially confusing to identify it as fake news. A undated post on LondonWebNews.com said Conway told a media member at a Washington luncheon that left-leaning females dislike Conway because of her "striking beauty and intellect." The post was published June 1, 2017, and updated June 13. Facebook users flagged the post as part of the social media site’s efforts to fight fake news, and this one does appear to be contrived. The post didn’t name the reporter, media outlet or event, and only featured the partial quote allegedly from Conway. The article did say pundits attacked Conway for the comment. We couldn’t find any instance of a reliable media report that corroborated the story, or any pundit who reacted to it. The post also said Conway drew criticism on social media, but good luck finding anything on this specific (fake) comment that doesn’t track back to LondonWebNews.com. The site does not appear to be filled entirely with fictional stories, like some fake news websites. It looked to include posts taken from many places, including reliable news sources. One post, for example, was about the June 14, 2017, Grenfell Tower fire in London. This kind of mix would make it very difficult for a reader to be able to discern this particular item is fabricated. The site’s disclaimer said only that the site made "no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, about the completeness, accuracy, reliability, suitability, or availability" of anything it posted. "Any reliance you place on such information is therefore strictly at your own risk," it warned. We tried to contact LondonNewsWeb.com via the email address provided on the site but didn’t receive a response. There was no byline listed with the story. We did reach a White House spokesman, who didn’t want to give an official comment about the post. But there’s no proof Conway made this comment, either way.

pomt-00879	Georgia is one of only five states where breweries can’t sell you a pint of beer to drink on premise or sell you a six-pack to go.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/mar/11/georgia-craft-brewers-guild/advocate-craft-beer-brewers-correct-claim/	As the popularity of craft beer continues to grow, so do the legislative fights over how to regulate the industry. In Georgia, craft beer brewers say they are at a competitive disadvantage both regionally and nationally because state law prohibits them from selling directly to consumers. They’ve been trying for about a decade to change state law. They are back lobbying the Georgia General Assembly this year. In the meantime, craft beer, generally defined as beer brewed by relatively small regional breweries, continues to become more popular and profitable. The national Brewers Association, based in Colorado estimates that, 207,000 barrels of craft beer were produced in Georgia in 2013 and that the industry contributed $33.9 billion to the national economy, $671 million to Georgia’s economy, taking into account its impact on breweries, wholesalers, retailers, jobs even brewpub restaurants and taprooms. Legislatures across the country in recent years have wrestled with changing their alcohol and tax laws while weighing the competing interests of the craft beer brewers, the powerful big beer manufacturers and wholesalers. Part of the argument for the law change in Georgia is the relatively unique restrictions that exist here on beer brewers. Georgia "is one of only five states that do not allow beer factories or 'production breweries' to sell beer for neither on-premise consumption (pints) nor off premise consumption (packaged beer)," Nancy Palmer, executive director of the Georgia Craft Brewers Guild said Monday. Politifact decided to check the claim. We reached out to Palmer, who warned us that "this issue is a little complicated." "Section 2 of the 21st Amendment provides huge amount of leeway to the states to regulate alcohol, and each has come up with as many laws about it as there are stars in the sky," she said. "The laws on alcohol vary from state to state significantly more than gun control or the control of illicit drugs." She said her research showed that only four states, besides Georgia, have laws prohibiting direct sales by breweries to consumers. They are West Virginia, Hawaii, Mississippi and North Dakota. We contacted Palmer’s counterpart with the brewers’ associations in Mississippi. Mark Henderson of Lazy Magnolia Brewing Company confirmed that Mississippi does not allow its breweries to sell beer for on-site or off-site consumption. Todd Sattler, with the brewers association in North Dakota, said, however, that restrictions are not as tight there. "We have on premise sales and growler sales," he told PolitiFact. In West Virginia, a brewer or resident brewer "cannot even sample or sell a pint for on- or off-premise consumption," said Brian Arnett with Mountain State Brewing Company. But there’s a loophole in West Virginia: "You can buy a brewpub license that allows sampling and pint sales, Arnett said. Palmer said Hawaii has already addressed the issue by incorporating brewpubs with its breweries so direct sales can take place, similar to what Arnett mentioned is happening in West Virginia. Direct sales are believed to be critical to a brewery’s success in much the same way wine sales contribute to a winery’s bottom line, she said. Craft brewers have been pushing Senate Bill 63, which initially would have allowed breweries to sell pints of beer to the public in an amount not to exceed 72 ounces per person per day and to sell no more than 144 ounces of packaged beer to-go per person, per day. However, a substitute passed out of committee Friday that prohibits direct sales by breweries. It alters the current tour structure so that brewers can give away 36 ounces on-premises during the tour (compared to the current 32 ounces) as well as a "souvenir" malt beverage container of no more than 64 ounces to-go. Our ruling The Georgia Craft Brewers Guild is lobbying for breweries to have the right to sell directly to "consumers. The group argues craft beer breweries in the state are at a disadvantage because "Georgia is one of only 5 states where breweries can’t sell you a pint of beer to drink or sell you any to go." They were identified as West Virginia, Hawaii, Mississippi and North Dakota. But we found that at least North Dakota doesn't belong on the list with Georgia. 'It's clear that most states have already cleared the path for these sales. Others are moving in that direction. That’s the Georgia guild’s over-arching point. We rate the statement as Mostly True.

pomt-08285	"If all of the [Bush-era] tax cuts expire on schedule, the budget will be close to being balanced in four years."	false	/virginia/statements/2010/nov/05/bobby-scott/bobby-scott-said-budget-will-be-close-balanced-fou/	On his way to re-election, Rep. Robert C. "Bobby" Scott made no secret that he’d like to see the Bush-era tax cuts expire. All of them. Distancing himself from Democrat colleagues, Scott, who represents Virginia’s 3rd Congressional District, said the cuts from 2001 and 2003 should not be continued even for those bringing home less than $250,000 a year. "Extending the Bush tax cuts will add $3.6 trillion to the national debt," he wrote in a Richmond Times-Dispatch voter guide. "If all of the tax cuts expire on schedule, the budget will be close to being balanced in 4 years." We were curious about the claim that elimination of the Bush-era tax cuts could mean an almost-balanced budget in just a few years. But before looking at whether or not the budget could be balanced in four years, we wanted to make sure the $3.6 trillion figure checked out. Although estimates vary, yes, that’s pretty close to official 10-year projections of the cost to extend all of the Bush-era tax cuts including adjustments to the alternative minimum tax, or AMT, a substitute income tax levied against some high earners. In 2001, after the first round of tax cuts, the Bush administration realized that without adjusting the AMT, about 25 percent of the cuts weren’t getting to people. To fix that, they passed a three-year adjustment raising the AMT exemption levels and have extended it every year since. "Patching the AMT prevents about 20 million more Americans from paying higher taxes," said Gerald Prante, a senior economist with the Tax Foundation, a business-backed tax policy group. According to July analysis from the Office of Management and Budget, the cost of extending the tax cuts and continuing to adjust the AMT would be about $3.6 trillion over 10 years. An August report by the Congressional Budget Office actually shows a higher figure of $3.9 trillion as the 10-year cost of extending the cuts and patching the AMT. The U.S. Department of Treasury in February estimated the cost a little higher than $3.7 trillion. In case you’re curious, extending tax cuts for those earning more than $250,000 a year accounts for about $679 billion for the 10 years while patching the AMT accounts for about $672 billion, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Tax relief for familes earing $250,000 or less costs about $2.3 trillion over 10 years. So, let’s determine if letting the tax cuts expire and not patching the AMT could balance the budget in four years. -- or at least come close, as Scott says. To do that, we looked at estimated annual costs of continuing the tax cuts and compared that to projected deficit figures.. According to the OMB report in July, the projected deficit in 2014 is $896 billion. That same year, the additional tax revenue from not extending the tax cuts nor patching the AMT would be $320 billion, reducing the deficit to $576 billion. Not a balanced budget. In 2015, the story is about the same. The projected deficit that year is $985 billion and the the combined estimated cost of continuing the tax cuts and patching the AMT is $353 billion. So, even if the cuts expire and the AMT is not patched, that would leave a deficit of $632 billion. Again, nowhere near balanced. "So no, you cannot get rid of the deficit by letting the Bush tax cuts expire anytime within the next 10-year period," said Prante. "For any given year, it’s not anywhere close to the size of the deficit." We thought we’d get another perspective just to be sure. Robert Williams, senior fellow for the Tax Policy Center, pointed to numbers from the CBO’s August budget update, which project that the deficit would fall below 3 percent of Gross Domestic Product by 2014 if the tax cuts expire. Three percent of GDP is a "sustainable" deficit level, according to Peter Orszag, former director of the White House Office of Management and Budget. Williams said, "One could consider a deficit of that magnitude ‘nearly balanced’ in the sense that debt as a percentage of GDP wouldn't rise if growth resumes its normal rate of more than 3 percent." But that seems like quite a stretch to us. So, let’s review. We must look at the projected annual cost of the tax cuts, if extended, to determine how much could be saved by allowing them to expire. Depending on the source, those estimates when coupled with the AMT adjustment, range between $200 to $500 billion annually over the next 10 years. But with budget deficits projected to hover around $1 trillion a year during that time period, the extra tax revenue from allowing the cuts to expire wouldn’t even cut the deficit in half in four years, much less balance the budget. So we rate the claim False.	None	Bobby Scott	None	None	None	2010-11-05T16:09:06	2010-10-12	['None']

pomt-13872	"During my administration, for example, we boosted U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico by about 50 percent. That supports about 2.8 million American jobs."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/05/barack-obama/obama-incorrectly-characterizes-job-growth-due-inc/	President Barack Obama joined Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto June 30, 2016, to celebrate their countries’ partnerships. The "Three Amigos" press conference — part of the North American Leaders Summit in Ottawa — saw the three leaders addressing issues of globalization. All claimed better relationships with their neighbors, and Obama in particular said the United States thrives as a result. "During my administration, for example, we boosted U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico by about 50 percent," he said. "That supports about 2.8 million American jobs." The statement resonates this election as free trade policies have been front and center. Both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have attacked Hillary Clinton on her trade record, claiming it cost domestic jobs. Yet Obama suggests exports have supported, not destroyed, jobs. So we took a closer look at whether his claims hold up. On the rise We looked to the Bureau of Economic Analysis to verify the number. The White House told us they started from 2009, the first year of Obama’s term, as they do for all measures of economic change. So to calculate the percentage change, we first need to identify the total amount of exports, both goods and services. We calculated a 51 percent increase between 2009 and 2015. As for trade with Mexico, there was a 76 percent spike. Canada saw a 36 percent increase. The White House used quarterly data, which yields a 57 percent increase. We used annual data upon advice of multiple experts. A year makes all the difference So the baseline numbers support Obama’s assertion about the rise in exports. But experts say the specific timeframe Obama used, "during my administration," is misleading. Obama took office in 2009 at the height of a global economic recession. As such, exports to all countries were depressed. In this case, that is actually good for Obama. If exports were so low in 2009, it’d be easier to claim rapid growth when the larger trend might not be as eye-catching, said Mark Perry, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. Several experts told us 2008 — the year prior to Obama taking office — serves as a better baseline year and the economic standard for measuring accomplishments "during" a president’s administration. Using the same methodology as before, but starting from 2008, Canadian exports increased by 10 percent and Mexican exports by 50 percent. That translates to a 25 percent increase in total exports — not 50 percent. Ambiguous claims Obama also claimed the United States job market has been bolstered by the export trade. His office cited a study from the International Trade Administration within the Commerce Department, which found that, in 2014, exports to Mexico supported 1.1 million jobs and Canada 1.7 million. Add that up and you get 2.8 million jobs, of course. But Obama’s specific comments don’t necessarily reflect what the study said. In Ottawa, Obama said that the rise in exports to Canada and Mexico supported 2.8 million jobs. But the Commerce Department figures reflect the total number of jobs supported by exports to our neighboring countries — not the number of jobs created by the increase. The report indicates an increase of 514,000 jobs between 2009 and 2014 stemming from exports to Mexico and Canada. The 2.8 million figure applies to the "number of jobs in 2014" supported by all exports to Mexico and Canada. Job displacing The statistic is also misleading as a picture of trade because it fails to consider "job-displacing" imports and the trade balance, said Robert Scott, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. Total imports from Canada and Mexico to the United States have increased less than exports, percentage-wise, since 2008. As a result, Scott said, our total trade deficit with Canada and Mexico has declined. That’s good for job growth, he said, but not as good as Obama makes it out to be. Doing his own research, Scott estimated net job growth since 2008 by comparing the trade deficit to United States’ gross domestic product, and then looking at the historical relationships between GDP and employment. Point being, Scott used the trade deficit, not just exports, and found that at most 500,000 jobs could have been created by U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade since 2008. It is important to note the economists still debate the relationship between jobs and trade. More pro-free-trade economists argue imports actually boost American jobs because of increased economic demand. Some, like Gary Hufbauer at the Peterson Institute of International Economics, said two-way trade has little net effect on jobs. Cause and effect The last piece to this claim is whether the Obama administration is truly responsible for the increase in exports. Obama did launch the National Export Initiative in 2010 to promote export-conducive conditions in the private sector. His goal was to double exports from its $8.5 billion level in 2009, but the number has fallen far short, said Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Perry also noted exports to Canada and Mexico have fallen as of late, with Canadian exports below their 2008 peak levels. Obama’s accomplishments have had some effect on exports, but experts said there were larger influences at play. Gradual economic recovery in Canada and Mexico after the recession played a significant role, for example. Oil discoveries — both abroad and domestically — as well as currency exchange rates also helped boost American exports, Scott said. Exports of oil have increased from 858,000 in 2010 to 1.7 million in 2015 to all countries (not just Mexico and Canada), according to the Energy Information Administration. Agricultural products also make up a significant portion of exports to both Canada and Mexico — America's largest and third largest agricultural export market, respectively. Our ruling Obama said, "During my administration, for example, we boosted U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico by about 50 percent. That supports about 2.8 million American jobs." The first claim is plausible, though experts say Obama should have used 2008, not 2009, as his baseline. That change would have cut the growth down to about 30 percent. The second claim is wrong, so long as you believe Obama to be suggesting that 2.8 million jobs were created due to export increases.

pomt-13102	"We can fix our roads without raising taxes."	false	/illinois/statements/2016/nov/04/citizens-protect-transportation-funding/safe-roads-backers-tax-claim-defies-reality/	Illinois voters are being asked whether they want to amend their state constitution to create a kind of lockbox to prevent lawmakers from raiding the proceeds from gas taxes, vehicle registration fees and other transportation-related surcharges that make up the state’s road fund. A coalition called Citizens to Protect Transportation Funding -- comprised of groups including the state’s road construction industry, business and transportation advocates -- has collected $3.75 million and spent more than $2.05 million on TV ads, a website and airtime to promote "yes" votes for the "Safe Roads" constitutional amendment this fall. One of the group’s oft-repeated claims in its ads and campaign materials is that the state’s infrastructure can be repaired without raising taxes if the amendment is approved. "Now we can regain control. Vote to require politicians to spend those transportation fees on transportation only. We can fix our roads without raising taxes," a narrator says in one of the ads. Given the state has operated without a budget since mid 2015 and leads the nation in unpaid general and pension funds’ debt, we wanted to examine whether that was true. A taxing situation The move by the coalition was prompted by a history of Illinois governors and lawmakers borrowing from the state’s road fund when budget gaps arise. Indeed, Gov. Bruce Rauner and Democratic majority lawmakers agreed to sweep $350 million from the road fund last year. A few months later, those same lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to put the amendment to voters -- only four lawmakers out of 177 opposed it. For the current fiscal year, the road fund and the motor fuel tax fund combined have collected $1.62 billion, but transportation advocates have said the state will need $43 billion over the next 10 years to address needs, or $4.3 billion per year. A search of the language in the amendment did not find any references to locking in current tax rates or fees. However, a section explaining reasons to oppose the amendment suggests other areas of the budget may need to be cut in order to prioritize transportation: "As a result, elected officials may be asked to reduce funding for other priorities, such as education or social service programs." Many Democratic majority lawmakers have argued Illinois needs to increase taxes to help erase its bill backlog and to correct what they say is a perennially underfunded state government. Illinois does not collect enough revenue to cover all the services citizens expect, they argue. At the same time, they allowed a temporary income tax increase approved in 2011 to expire at the end of 2014. Several attempts to tax the state’s millionaires at a higher rate have failed, but no other votes to raise taxes have occurred as Rauner and Democratic majority leaders remain at war and in the midst of a budget impasse. Charlie Wheeler, director of the Public Affairs Reporting Program at the University of Illinois-Springfield and a former reporter who covered the state budget for decades, said he believes it will be practically impossible to avoid a tax increase if road funds are off limits. He noted Rauner’s budget office says the state’s budget is operating $4 billion in the red while its Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability says the figure is more like $7 billion. The state began November with more than $9 billion in overdue bills to pay, according to the Illinois Comptroller’s Office. When the next fiscal year begins next July, Wheeler said, the figures above mean it’s likely the state will be $14 billion to $15 billion behind in paying its bills. The state generates only between $30 billion to $32 billion annually for general spending. "If they say generically taxes won’t go up they’re flat out wrong. Taxes will go up and everybody concedes it," Wheeler said. "Now if they’re saying if we do this, we won’t have to increase the gasoline tax, I’d say that’s pretty dubious." If history is a predictor, then the past would seem to suggest fixing the state’s infrastructure will mean more money from residents. Wheeler noted that major state construction programs launched by three previous Democrat and Republican governors all contained provisions to raise new revenue in one or multiple forms. Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn enacted video gambling with tax proceeds going to construction. GOP Gov. George Ryan launched Illinois First by raising vehicle registration fees and alcohol taxes. Before him, former GOP Gov. Jim Thompson oversaw a program called Build Illinois that included a new tax on the private sale of used cars. Taxes and fees that go into the road fund are trending downward as well, Wheeler noted, as vehicles become more fuel efficient. At the same time, costs to build roads and bridges are increasing. "I don’t think it’s accurate at all. It’s not as inaccurate as many campaign ads, but it’s disingenuous," Wheeler said of the safe roads ad. "You have to pay for the things you want." Additionally, some of the people pushing for passage of the amendment have alluded to the need to generate more tax revenue, if not for roads, then elsewhere if the road fund is off limits. Doug Whitley, past president and CEO of the Illinois State Chamber of Commerce, recently wrote: "Unabated raids upon funds financed by user fees has been precipitated by elected officials’ unwillingness to assume responsibility for raising taxes to assure the General Fund is capable of meeting the state’s fundamental obligations to education, healthcare, human services, public safety and pension payments. Shutting off the fund raids will help force the issue." James R. Reilly, a senior fellow focusing on transportation policy at the Metropolitan Planning Council, wrote that to "get our transportation infrastructure in good shape again, Illinois needs to invest an additional $43 billion over the next ten years. "One thing we must do is make a significant investment in our transportation network. It’s hard to ask voters to make that investment, though, without the assurance that the money will actually be spent on transportation." Laurence Msall, president of the government finance watchdog Civic Federation, said his organization found the state only has diverted about $520 million from road funds between 2004 and 2015, but Illinois’ needs are far greater than what now is collected for road and bridge and other transportation-related expenses. "To say that you’d be able to fix roads without raising taxes fails to recognize the condition the state is already in without this constitutional amendment," Msall said. "This will likely make it harder to stabilize the state’s finances. "A constitutional amendment to lockbox road funds is likely to do for our roads what the lottery did for the state’s education needs," Msall added, "which was an easy answer to a complicated problem but did not fix it." Our ruling Ads created and paid for by Citizens to Protect Transportation Funding say "we can fix our roads without raising taxes." But government budget experts say the state’s road needs already are far greater than what is collected in gas taxes and related fees. Illinois leads the nation in unpaid bills and has not had a budget since mid 2015.

pomt-13548	Says "President Obama’s proposed oil tax would cost consumers 24 cents a gallon."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/aug/26/paul-ryan/how-much-would-barack-obama-10-barrel-tax-oil-rais/	In an Aug. 11, 2016 tweet that was augmented with a bit of animation (a counter with rolling numbers), House Speaker Paul Ryan declared: "President Obama’s proposed oil tax would cost consumers 24 cents a gallon." That’s a flat declaration of a specific figure. Let’s see if it’s on the money. Ryan’s evidence To back Ryan’s statement, his office cited a February 2016 article from MarketWatch.com, which reported on Obama’s proposal for a $10 tax on each barrel of oil to pay for "clean" transportation projects such as expanding mass transit. The article said the tax would be paid by oil companies and gradually phased in over five years. To be clear, the article said the proposal "isn’t expected to go far." And in a news release Ryan issued the same day as his tweet, he said the tax is "dead on arrival in Congress." The MarketWatch article quoted Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst at GasBuddy.com, as saying: "This proposal would trickle down and be a $10 per barrel tax on motorists -- or 20 to 25 cents per gallon on refined fuels. To me it’s clear: this is not something oil companies are going to absorb." So, 24 cents is in the range of the analyst’s estimate. But it’s only one analyst; and his estimate is based on how he thinks oil companies would respond to a $10-per-barrel tax. What the oil companies would do isn’t quite as certain as what Ryan claimed. A trade group that should know, the American Petroleum Institute, warned the tax would "harm consumers." But it hedged a bit in saying the tax "could" raise the cost of gasoline by 25 cents a gallon. Economist Nicolas Loris estimated the cost slightly lower, at 22 cents, the Huffington Post said 22 to 24 cents, and the Washington Post said 24 cents. Politico and Forbes said about 25 cents. One note: The federal government currently imposes a tax of 18.4 cents per gallon of gasoline. But that’s a direct tax on gas, not on the oil companies. Our rating Ryan said: "President Obama’s proposed oil tax would cost consumers 24 cents a gallon." Estimates are in the 24 cents range for the $10-per-barrel tax that Obama proposed on oil companies. But it’s not a sure thing, if the tax became law, that all of the tax would be passed onto consumers. We rate the statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/160d66f4-9b16-42c6-8bd7-c1c7d19868f1	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2016-08-26T10:30:00	2016-08-11	['None']
pomt-03254	"We need to pass a carbon tax to stop climate change. Break up the Wall Street banks. And stop the government spying on innocent Americans. Cory Booker doesn’t support any of these ideas."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/aug/11/rush-holt/rush-holt-tv-ad-claims-cory-booker-doesnt-support-/	They’re among the more controversial issues in America today: climate change, behemoth Wall Street banks and domestic spying. And Rep. Rush Holt (D-12th), a candidate in Tuesday’s Democratic primary for the late Frank Lautenberg’s U.S. Senate seat, claims another candidate in the race doesn’t support taxing, breaking up or ending any of those issues for the betterment of the nation. "We need to pass a carbon tax to stop climate change. Break up the Wall Street banks. And stop the government spying on innocent Americans," Holt said in a recent TV ad. "Cory Booker doesn’t support any of these ideas." Holt’s claim isn’t completely accurate, and raises an issue of semantics. Booker, the mayor of Newark, along with Holt, Rep. Frank Pallone (D-6tth) and state Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver (D-Essex) are the four candidates in this week’s primary. The winner will face the winner of the Republican primary between Steve Lonegan, the former director of the New Jersey chapter of Americans for Prosperity, and Dr. Alieta Eck. A special election for the Senate seat is scheduled Oct. 16. Let’s look at the three points in Holt’s ad and review where Booker stands on each issue. First, the carbon tax and climate change. Holt has proposed a tax on carbon dioxide emissions, which account for 75 percent of greenhouse gases during the past 40 years, according to a report from the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change that Holt references on his campaign website. He also claims that during the next two decades, a carbon tax could prevent the emission of 9.2 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide and by mid-century, reduce U.S. emissions by a third. Kevin Griffis, senior adviser and communications director for Booker’s campaign, said in an e-mail that Booker "hasn’t taken a public position on a carbon tax, which is largely a federal or state-level issue. He has spoken extensively about the importance of regional greenhouse gas agreements, reducing carbon emissions and producing green jobs." Booker also hadn’t take a public position on breaking up Wall Street banks by the time Holt’s ad aired on Aug. 5. Booker addressed both issues, however, in a campaign questionnaire to The Star-Leger. Booker said legislation must be passed that reduces carbon production, and involve a market-based approach, including cap and trade or a carbon tax. He also said in the questionnaire that he "would support exploring additional rules" to limit risky actions by financial institutions, but didn’t say whether he supported breaking up Wall Street banks. As for alleged domestic spying on civilian Americans’ phone calls and e-mails by the National Security Agency, Booker’s campaign says the mayor believes in striking a balance between enforcing privacy protections guaranteed by Constitution while also protecting the country from terrorism. Booker also supports amending, instead of ending, the 11-year-old Patriot Act, which reduces the restrictions law enforcement once had in investigating terrorism. So should the electorate care if a candidate doesn’t respond publicly on particular issues? "One rule of thumb for politicians is that you have to define yourself before someone else does it for you," said Ben Dworkin, director of The Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics and an adjunct assistant professor of political science at Rider University in Lawrenceville. "The essence of a campaign, a competitive campaign, is to draw distinction." Griffis maintains that Holt’s ad isn’t accurate. "Our basic position is that not being on the record about something, especially when the mayor would not have had occasion to discuss it in the past, is not the same as stating his affirmative support or opposition to an idea or initiative, and therefore, the Holt ad is misleading," Griffis said in an e-mail. The Holt campaign, however, emphasizes that Booker not taking a public position on significant issues speaks loudly to voters. "With due respect to the mayor, ‘I haven't taken a position’ isn't a rebuttal," Thomas Seay, Holt’s communications director, said in an e-mail. "It's a restatement of the problem." Our ruling Holt said in a TV ad, "We need to pass a carbon tax to stop climate change. Break up the Wall Street banks. And stop the government spying on innocent Americans. Cory Booker doesn’t support any of these ideas." Booker hadn’t taken a position on those issues by the time the ad had aired, but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t support or reject them. It simply means he hasn’t taken a position thus far. But let’s look at the flip side, too. Without knowing where Booker stands on these issues, New Jerseyans can legitimately question whether he supports a carbon tax, breaking up Wall Street banks and ending domestic spying. That lack of context is what makes Holt’s claim partially accurate, and why we rate Holt’s claim Half True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-01280	"Kansas has not elected somebody other than a Republican (to the U.S. Senate) since before 'The Wizard of Oz' hit the movie theaters."	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/nov/02/jonathan-karl/last-time-kansans-elected-someone-other-republican/	With results just hours away in the country’s closest political races, Sunday morning pundits made the case for the best and worst candidates of the 2014 midterm elections. One man frequently mentioned for the latter unenviable distinction is U.S. Sen. Pat Roberts, a Kansas Republican locked in an unexpectedly tight race against independent Greg Orman. Roberts has struggled despite his status as an incumbent in a super conservative state, a headache of a situation for Republicans who want to flip control of the Senate. "There’s a clear worst candidate this year. It’s Pat Roberts," ABC White House correspondent Jonathan Karl said on This Week. "I mean, Kansas has not elected somebody other than a Republican since before The Wizard of Oz hit the movie theaters." The classic film that opens with a tornado sweeping through a Kansas farm made its debut 75 years ago in 1939. Has it really been that long since Kansas elected someone who wasn’t a Republican to the U.S. Senate? Actually, it’s been longer. Eighty-two years, to be exact. The last Democratic senator the state sent to Washington was George McGill, a lawyer from Wichita who served from 1930-39. After winning a 1932 election, McGill lost his 1938 re-election bid. The only other Democratic senators from Kansas were John Martin, who filled out the remainder of a deceased senator’s term from 1893-95, and William Howard Thompson, who served from 1913-19, according to the Biographical Directory of the U.S. Congress. Two Kansas senators served as members of the Populist Party, though both were elected at the turn of the century well before The Wizard of Oz movie release. The other 28 senators were all Republicans, including Roberts, who won his first election to Congress in 1981 and his first U.S. Senate race in 1996. For an incumbent such as Roberts to be in such a vulnerable position is highly unusual, said Burdett Loomis, professor of political science at the University of Kansas. Winning a seat in the U.S. Senate from Kansas has been mostly very easy for Republicans. The GOP has long dominated all layers of Kansas politics, with the state last voting for a Democratic candidate for president in 1964. (A notable recent exception is when Kathleen Sebelius won the governor's race as a Democrat in 2002 and 2006.) "In that context, it’s just very weird because this is about as favorable an environment for a Republican as you can get," Loomis said, "and it’s also supposed to be a good year for Republicans across the country." Roberts was weakened early in his re-election bid by a New York Times report that revealed he does not have a home of his own in Kansas. He survived his primary despite tea party criticisms that he is a Washington insider. His attacks against Orman have largely failed and he has focused more on criticizing President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid than documenting his own achievements, Loomis said. "I think Roberts could have more easily won a conventional race," Loomis said. "Running against an independent, it really is harder." Even though Kansas is usually a reliably conservative state, the state’s share of residents who identify as moderates (36 percent) is about the same as those who say they are conservative at 38 percent, according to a Gallup analysis. This could be one reason Orman is doing well in pre-election polls. Also, according to Gallup, Kansas is on the low end of the 10 reddest states in terms of residents who describe their political ideology as conservative. The Roberts-Orman race is considered a toss-up by Real Clear Politics and The Cook Political Report. Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight.com gives Orman a 54 percent chance of winning. Our ruling Talking about the midterm campaign with the most blunders, Karl said Roberts is the "clear worst candidate of the year," pointing to the fact that "Kansas has not elected somebody other than a Republican since before The Wizard of Oz hit the movie theaters." Karl’s talking point is on the money. Kansas last elected a Democrat to the U.S. Senate in 1932. The Wizard of Oz was released seven years later. His claim rates True.

pomt-12648	"Since China joined — that’s another beauty — the WTO in 2001, the U.S. has lost many more than 60,000 factories."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/24/donald-trump/trump-china-joined-wto-us-has-lost-60000-factories/	Speaking at a March 20 rally in Louisville, Ky., President Donald Trump said he wants to be like Henry Clay, a 19th century Kentucky politician who Trump said was "a fierce advocate for manufacturing." From there, Trump launched into his usual critique of United States free trade policy over the last 20 years, laying out what he’s going to do to address trade imbalances with Mexico and China, in particular. "Since China joined — that’s another beauty — the WTO in 2001, the U.S. has lost many more than 60,000 factories," he said. We’ve heard Trump make this claim about the effects of China joining the World Trade Organization in a few different speeches since becoming president, so we wanted to put it on the Truth-O-Meter. We reached out to the White House for Trump’s source but didn’t hear back. However, through our own research we found that the United States has, in fact, lost more than 60,000 factories since 2001, when China joined the WTO and became a bigger player in the world economy. And quite a few economists believe opening up trade with China has had a significant and negative effect on American manufacturing, though it’s not a universal view. To count the number of factories, we used the U.S. Census’ annual Statistics of U.S. Businesses series, which tallies the number of manufacturing establishments. An example of how the count works: Ford Motor Company has three U.S.-based transmission plants, two in Michigan and one in Ohio. That counts as three separate establishments. In 2001, the year China joined the WTO, the Census counted 352,619 manufacturing establishments. In 2014, the most recent year for which data is available, it counted 292,543. That’s a drop of 60,076 over those three years. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Another Census series, its Business Dynamics Statistics, tallied 348,513 manufacturing establishments in 2001 and 274,756 in 2014 — a drop of 73,757 manufacturing establishments. It’s not fair to assume that China’s economic rise is entirely responsible for all of these lost factories, as someone might think when they hear Trump’s statement, but it is certainly responsible for some. Around the same time China joined the WTO, the United States gave China permanent normal trade relations status. Both of these actions removed significant barriers to trade and investment with China, basically putting them on an even playing field with the United States’ other trading partners. In the 16 years since, United States imports from China have quadrupled, in large part because production is so cheap there, making U.S.-based manufacturers less competitive. We found three significant economic studies from the past few years that all conclude increased free trade with China has had a negative impact on American manufacturing and jobs. A a 2014 report out of the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute found that the U.S. trade deficit with China has cost 2.4 million manufacturing jobs between 2001 and 2013. The report cites illegal Chinese policies that encourage exports and keep labor cheap, as well as a failure of the WTO agreement that endorsed China’s membership to prevent these sorts of actions. Proponents of expanding U.S.-China trade also overestimated the potential market for U.S. exports in China. Research conducted by a group of economists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Zurich and the University of California, San Diego, found comparable job losses due to import competition from China. They found that areas in the United States that had a large number of jobs in industries for which imports from China surged have suffered the most. A third analysis co-authored by Justin Pierce, a member of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve Board, and Peter Schott, a Yale economist, found a causal relationship between factory closures and China’s permanent normal trade relations status. One reason for this connection is that in granting China this status, the United States agreed not to raise tariffs on Chinese imports, and that newfound stability incentivized American businesses to move operations to China. While these analyses support Trump’s general idea that trade with China has caused some factory closures in the United States, none of them say how many. Robert Scott, director of trade and manufacturing policy research at the Economic Policy Institute and co-author of the first study, told PolitiFact that trade with China is a leading cause of a decline in manufacturing, but there’s also growing trade deficits with other parts of Asia and Europe. A smaller factor in more recent years is the Great Recession and the slow recovery that followed. Bradford DeLong, an economic historian at the University of California, Berkeley, is less convinced that opening up trade with China had such a negative effect on U.S. manufacturing. Rather, he told PolitiFact that he estimates about one-tenth of factory closures over the past decade or so have had to do with China, but that would have happened whether or not China joined the WTO. In the years leading up to 2001, U.S. imports from China were already surging. He added that improved trade with China also might have allowed some new manufacturing establishments to open because of new opportunities to export goods and services to China. He said significantly increased manufacturing productivity in the United States, coupled with limited demand — there’s only so many refrigerators a person wants to buy — play a bigger role in factory closures in the United States. "Manufacturing has become too productive to remain or ever again become a major source of employment on the shop floor," he said. Our ruling Trump said, "Since China joined — that’s another beauty — the WTO in 2001, the U.S. has lost many more than 60,000 factories." According to Census data, the United States has lost more than 60,000 factories since 2001. Economic experts told us that at least some of these losses can be attributed to increased trade with China, though there is not universal agreement on the extent of that impact.

pomt-05655	"Make no mistake -- Sherrod Brown is one of the main D.C. politicians responsible for Ohio jobs moving to China."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2012/mar/20/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-says-sherrod-brown-responsible-ohio-jo/	This is about Josh Mandel. But with your indulgence, we must tell you about Sherrod Brown first. Brown is one of the U.S. Senate’s most ardent critics of this country’s foreign trade policies. An Ohio Democrat, he says he supports the ideal of free trade, but adds that poorly drafted trade agreements and weak enforcement of trade rules have let China and other foreign countries step all over American businesses and workers. His backup? China’s lax labor, safety and environmental standards. It’s minuscule wages that make it attractive for manufacturers seeking cheap labor. It’s currency manipulation that keeps its export prices artificially low. All of these make it harder for American companies with a domestic workforce to compete, Brown says, yet make China attractive to companies that want to cut labor costs, especially for low-skilled hourly workers. Trade is Brown’s signature issue. He has voted against trade deal after trade deal -- with South Korea, Panama, Colombia, Central America, Mexico and Canada and, most importantly here, China. So anyone who follows Brown had to appreciate a recent political jab by Brown’s Republican opponent in this year’s Senate election, namely, Mandel. Mandel, currently Ohio’s state treasurer, said in a news release on March 1, when he announced he was actively campaigning for the Senate: "Make no mistake -- Sherrod Brown is one of the main D.C. politicians responsible for Ohio jobs moving to China." Had Mandel just co-opted Brown’s best-known issue? This would make for quite an interception and, in the game of politics, it deserved kudos. But we wondered: Can Mandel back up his claim? We asked, and campaign spokesman Travis Considine sent several points in an email: * The federal stimulus bill in 2009, on which Brown cast a crucial, down-to-the-wire vote, led to tens of millions in taxpayer money being spent on wind turbine parts made in China. The purpose of the bill was to provide jobs in the United States, not China, Considine said. * Excessive federal regulations that Brown supports "destroy American jobs and drive businesses overseas." * This country’s complex tax code and its high corporate tax rate "puts America at a competitive disadvantage and drives jobs overseas." * "Unchecked federal borrowing and spending (supported by Brown) dissuades job-creating investment in America." Considine also added Brown’s votes against the Keystone XL pipeline; the amount of U.S. debt held by China and its 1,807 percent increase since Brown entered Congress as a House freshman in 1993, and the total number of pages in the Federal Register, which lists regulations. That’s a lot to consider, but these can be dealt with quickly. The proposed 1,700-mile-long Keystone pipeline from Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast has not been built. If the Obama administration or congressional Democrats block it because of environmental concerns, Canada says it might send oil from its oil sands to China rather than to the United States. The oil could help China meet its energy needs. But it has not yet happened. The pipeline won’t go through Ohio anyway, so any connection to Ohioans losing jobs to China is speculative and tangential. The stimulus bill, formally called the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, is credited by many economists with pumping enough money into the United States economy to keep the recession from spiralling out of control. There are doubters, though, and there were missteps. ABC News and American University’s Investigative Reporting Workshop reported in early 2010 that of $2 billion in stimulus money for building renewable energy projects such as a giant wind-energy farm, 80 percent went to foreign companies, including Chinese. Mandel’s spokesman cited this specific news story to support Mandel’s claim that Brown is responsible for moving jobs to China, since Brown cast a key vote on the stimulus. The story would have been accurate but for one thing: The wind project with the Chinese connection never got completed. Since companies could only collect money after completion and the program expired last year, it is safe to say that the amount that went to China was "zero," Russ Choma, the reporter who performed the digging at the Investigative Reporting Workshop, told us. This stimulus-and-the-Chinese claim has had tentacles in other political races, and Mandel is not alone in citing it. PolitiFact Georgia (in a similar claim about a Georgia lawmaker) and the national PolitiFact operation (in a claim by Sarah Palin) ruled in 2010 that the stimulus-goes-to-China statements were "False," largely for the reason we mentioned. But Choma’s reporting since then, and the program’s termination, has only strengthened the conclusion. That said, the original ABC News story and the mere prospect of the stimulus providing Chinese jobs prompted outrage from lawmakers -- including Brown. Brown has pushed consistently for "Buy America" provisions in spending and government-procurement bills. He tried to get one in the stimulus bill, in fact, but other lawmakers would only accept a weaker version, some saying they feared other countries would protest it was protectionist. So the specific parts of Mandel’s supporting evidence is weak. But what of his other points, on excessive regulation, the federal tax code, and unchecked borrowing and spending? Those are sweeping, part of a general complaint by many Republicans about Democrats, and plenty of people share that view. But in none of his examples does Mandel single out Brown’s votes or actions as specifically leading to jobs leaving Ohio for China. In fairness to Mandel, Brown has in fact pushed for greater regulation of consumer products, but most of his complaints were over products made in, of all places, China. He has sought stricter workplace-safety enforcement and in some cases stricter environmental rules. But there are no known cases of Ohio companies announcing that because Brown voted to beef up the Consumer Product Safety Commission or poultry-plant inspections, the work of $7.70-an-hour workers would be shifted to China for 77 cents or so an hour -- or $1.50 to $2.50 an hour, as is the case for iPad makers. PolitiFact Ohio looked at a number of government and private studies on this subject but none went directly to Mandel’s claim. A 2011 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, however, sums it up well: "U.S. firms that use China as the final point of assembly for their products, or use Chinese-made inputs for production in the United States, are able to lower costs and become more globally competitive... On the other hand, many analysts argue that growing economic ties with China have exposed U.S. manufacturing firms to greater, and what is often perceived to be ‘unfair’ competition from low-cost Chinese firms. They argue that this has induced many U.S. production facilities to relocate to China, resulting in the loss of thousands of U.S. manufacturing jobs." In other words, nothing sparks a move to China like competition from China. When making a time-for-change-in-Washington argument, Mandel shares a common gripe. But when saying Brown is one of the main Washington politicians responsible for Ohio jobs going to China, he relies on facts that fall apart and is left with generic rhetoric. Mandel deserves a nod for his chops in trying to co-opt Brown’s signature issue. But to steal a competitor’s theme, you’ve got to be right. We find Mandel’s claim was overly broad; dead wrong in the case of his most concrete backup examples and, overall, just not accurate. It was bold. It was audacious. But put under a microscope, it turned out to be ridiculous, which is a requirement for heating up the Truth-O-Meter. Pants on Fire!

pomt-14070	"I have had to fill out FEC reports for the past six years now, and they’re much more detailed than a tax return..."	false	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/may/20/tom-marino/pa-gop-congressmans-claim-about-donald-trump-and-h/	Congressman Tom Marino, R-Pa., has not wavered in his support of Donald Trump over the past few months, even in the midst of Trump’s current tax return controversy. "I have had to fill out FEC reports for the past six years now, and they’re much more detailed than a tax return..." Marino said in an effort to defend Trump in a recent interview on MSNBC. Federal Election Commission reports and tax filings can puzzle even the wonkiest of political observers. So out of these two tedious documents, which one is more detailed? And are they even worth comparing? Asked about why the congressman considers FEC filings to be more detailed, Marino’s communications director, Ainsley Holyfield, did not provide a clear answer. She described the length of Trump’s FEC filing -- 92 pages -- and added that there was no law requiring candidates to file tax returns. "We do believe these are comparable as they are both gathering in-depth financial information related to a person or entity," she said. "If the intent is to understand a person’s financial status, the same information can be gathered from both documents." Assets versus income Presidential candidates are required to disclose all of their assets with the FEC. In July 2015, Trump released a 92-page personal financial disclosure report, or FEC report, that listed all of his assets. Although the PFD contains details about all of Trump’s assets, it does not necessarily contain accurate information about the value of each asset. For example, the report lists the value of the Philadelphia branch of Trump National Golf Club as somewhere between "$5,000,001 - $25,000,000." Furthermore, a PFD is not audited. There is no government agency that validates the accuracy of presidential PFDs, so it is up to the candidate to accurately assess the value and income earned from each asset. A tax return, experts say, serves a different purpose. A tax return, which is audited, requires precise numbers for each income-earning asset. It does not include assets that do not earn an income, but contains numbers for the assets that it does list, not broad ranges like "$5,000,001 - $25,000,000." Brett Kappel, a partner with Akerman LLP and an election lawyer with over 25 years of experience, argues that the two documents are different by design. "The personal financial disclosure report is designed to disclose potential financial conflicts of interest, so it requires much greater disclosure of assets than a tax return." said Kappel. "A tax return is designed to capture income, so it contains much more information about income derived from assets." In other words, a tax return reflects how much income a person makes from their assets, and an FEC filing contains how many assets a person has. But which is more detailed? To begin answering this question, we asked Kappel if any significant information could be found in Donald Trump’s tax returns that is not present in his FEC report. In recent news, Trump has refused to release his tax returns, arguing that "there’s nothing to learn from them." Kappel said at least three things could be learned from a tax return: "actual income, charitable contributions and use of offshore accounts to hold and/or shelter income." A tax return will not reveal information like Trump’s net worth, but it will show his annual income and his charitable contributions. Much of Trump’s campaign is built around his image as a successful and generous businessman. A tax return would contain information that could either validate or discredit this image. On Feb. 25, Trump tweeted a picture of him signing what he called a recent tax return. The stack of tax return papers rises far above Trump’s head while he is sitting at his desk. In a recent interview with Fox News, Trump said the picture he gave had "about 2 1/2 feet of tax returns standing in front of [him]." On the other hand, Trump’s PFD on the Federal Election Commission’s website spans 92 pages. David Cay Johnston, a Pulitzer Prize-winning tax expert, believes that a tax return is more detailed than the form the FEC requires presidential candidates to fill out. "Look at the online photo of Trump next to what he says is his tax return" said Johnston. "Then get the FEC form, which runs far less than one ream of paper." Trump’s recent tax return seems to span significantly more pages than his PFD, but according to Johnston that’s not the biggest problem with Marino’s comparison. "The point," he said, "is that Rep. Marino is mixing oranges with horse apples." Our ruling Tom Marino said that a presidential FEC report is much more detailed than a tax return. The primary purpose of an FEC report is to list assets. A tax return provides detailed information about each income-earning asset. It may not list all of the filer’s assets -- as an FEC report would -- but it requires accurate income calculations for the assets that actually produce income. Also, an FEC report is not audited. Given the differences in the two types of forms, a comparison between the two is irrelevant, and experts say a tax return requires more exact measures of how much a person makes. We rate this claim False.	None	Tom Marino	None	None	None	2016-05-20T11:33:34	2016-05-13	['None']
